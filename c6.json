In an order issued January 18, the Commission En Banc directed Goodpocket and Easymoney to immediately cease and desist from engaging in, carrying out, promoting, and facilitating any lending activity/transaction until they have secured the necessary approval and authorization from the SEC.   The companies, their owners, operators, promoters, representatives, and agents were further enjoined to cease from offering and advertising their lending business through the internet or any other media, and to remove all materials involving such.   The Commission issued the order after finding that Goodpocket and Easymoney have been conducting lending activities despite not being registered as a corporation. Accordingly, both companies have no Certificates of Authority to operate as a lending or financing company.   Republic Act No. 9474, or the Lending Company Regulation Act of 2007 (LCRA), requires persons or entities operating as lending companies to register as corporations and to secure from the SEC the necessary authority to operate.   \\\\\\\\u201cThus, the act of these Online Lending Operators in offering and providing loans to the public constitutes actual fraud which was intentionally employed to lead the public into the belief that they are legally authorized to engage in the lending business which is not and has never been the case,\\\\\\\\u201d the Commission En Banc held.   The SEC has received complaints about the companies\\\\\\\\u2019 unfair collection processes, including the posting of libelous statements against borrowers on social media and the sending of such statements to their phone contacts.   \\\\\\\\u201cThe acts of these unregistered Online Lending Operators in illegally offering and providing loans to the public, charging high interest rates, and subjecting its debtors to unfair treatment through abusive and even libelous language in collecting the loaned amount, have no place in a society that is governed by and faithfully adheres to positive laws,\\\\\\\\u201d the Commission En Banc noted.

In an order dated January 5, the SEC Corporate Governance and Finance Department (CGFD) upheld its earlier order dated December 6, 2021 revoking the CA of Fynamics, which operates online lending platform Pondo Peso, for its fourth violation of Rule 8(a) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 9474, otherwise known as the Lending Company Regulation Act of 2007 (LCRA).   Rule 8(a) of the LCRA IRR provides that a lending company that has been duly registered and granted a CA shall file with the SEC reports/manuals, including interim semi-annual financial statements, in accordance with a designated schedule.   Fynamics failed to submit its 2020 Second Semester Interim Financial Statements on the February 15, 2021 deadline, as per SEC Memorandum Circular No. 3, Series of 2013, which is already the fourth time the company has not complied with the submission of the said report.   The CGFD gave Fynamics a chance to explain why its CA should not be revoked through a show cause letter dated July 7, 2021, and through a hearing on October 11, 2021. However, Fynamics failed to submit an explanation or appear in the hearing.   \\\\\\\\u201cThus, in light of the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s failure to respond to this Department\\\\\\\\u2019s Show Cause Letter and its continuous non-compliance with the reportorial requirements for lending companies, and considering that the Company was sufficiently notified and given opportunities to explain its position, this Department hereby finds that the revocation of the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s CA is in order,\\\\\\\\u201d the CGFD said.  Further, Fynamics did not file an appeal, motion for reconsideration, or petition for certiorari following the SEC\\\\\\\\u2019s issuance of the order revoking the company\\\\\\\\u2019s CA.   In addition to its failure to comply with reportorial requirements to the SEC, the CGFD has also previously penalized Fynamics for its first and second violations of SEC Memorandum Circular No. 18, Series of 2019, which provides the Prohibition on Unfair Debt Collection Practices of Financing Companies and Lending Companies.   \\\\\\\\u201c[I]n view of the foregoing, and in accordance with Part IV, Rule II, Sec. 2-4(a) of the [Revised Rules of Court], the Order revoking the Certificate of Authority to Operate as a Lending Company of Fynamics is final and executory.\\\\\\\\u201d   END",

8888-8141;8818-5478  7 December 2021  SEC SCORES 8th CONVICTION IN CRACKDOWN  AGAINST ILLEGAL LENDING  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) advanced its crackdown on illegal lending with another legal victory, after a regional trial court convicted the incorporators and directors of X-CEE789 Lending and Trading, Inc. for submitting falsified documents for its registration as a lending company.   In a decision dated June 30, the Pasay City Regional Trial Court Branch 118 found Merlinda A. Derequito, Mila R. Anonuevo, Haydee S. Alarcon, Maria Collen A. Custodio, Marisa D. Abaquin, Ramona C. Belen, Pinder Kaur Bhopal, Parvesh Kumar, Karan Kumar, Surinder Bhopal, Kamaljit Kaur, and Jaswinder Kaur guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 12(3)(a) of Republic Act No. 9474, or the Lending Company Regulation Act of 2007 (LCRA).   The court accordingly sentenced each of the respondents, who formed X-CEE789 as incorporators and directors, to pay a fine of P10,000, with costs.   The SEC filed the criminal complaint against the respondents upon finding that they made a false statement in their application for the incorporation of X-CEE789 and issuance of its authority to operate, as mandated by the LCRA.  X-CEE789 submitted a Certificate of Bank Deposit in the amount of P1 million, purportedly issued by Banco de Oro-Two Shopping Center Branch in Pasay City, to comply with the minimum paid-up capital prescribed by the LCRA during its registration as a lending company with the Commission in 2017.   Upon verifying with the bank, however, the SEC found that no such certificate was issued to X-CEE789. The Commission subsequently denied the company\\\\\\\\u2019s application for registration as a lending company.   Section 12, paragraph 3(a) of the LCRA penalizes with a fine ranging from P10,000 to P50,000 or imprisonment of not less than 6 months but not more than 10 years or both, any officer, employee or agent of a lending company who shall knowingly and willingly make any statement in any application, report, or document required under the law, which statement is false or misleading with respect to any material fact.   \\\\\\\\u201cFor knowingly and willingly making a false statement in their Articles of Incorporation and submitting a falsified Certificate of Bank Deposit that the law requires lending companies to file, the accused have clearly violated Section 12(3)(a) of RA 9474,\\\\\\\\u201d the court noted. Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway, 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  Luis Lopez, who was the former liaison officer of X-CEE786, said that it was his godfather Salvador Dapadap who told him to secure a Certificate of Bank Deposit from a certain Sarah Jane Ibasco for the company\\\\\\\\u2019s application. Mr. Lopez would then pay Ms. Ibasco, who supposedly arranged documents for filing with the SEC, P5,000 in exchange for the bank certificate.   Surinder Bhopal, Haydee Alarcon, and Karan Kumar admitted to signing the Articles of Incorporation of X-CEE789 stating that the company had a paid-up capital of P1 million. Kumar also noted that it was their agreement to pay their capital contribution to their friend, Parvesh Kumar, only after the company was registered with the SEC.   \\\\\\\\u201cPer their own admission, the accused never made any capital contribution at all\\\\\\\\u2026they said that they held on to their money because they believe that they will only give their contribution after the corporation has been registered and started operating as a lending company,\\\\\\\\u201d the court noted.   \\\\\\\\u201cThis is a willful violation of the law for which the accused cannot be excused.\\\\\\\\u201d  The conviction of the incorporators and directors of X-CEE789 represents the eighth conviction the SEC has won under a crackdown initiated in 2017 on illegal lenders, including those engaged in \\\\\\\\u201c5-6\\\\\\\\u201d schemes and other usurious practices. In the eight cases decided so far, the concerned trial courts found 71 individuals, 33 of whom are foreigners, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating the LCRA.  The SEC, through the Corporate Governance and Finance Department (CGFD), has likewise revoked the primary registration of a total of 2,081 lending companies to date for non-compliance with the LCRA.   To date, the SEC has also cancelled the licenses of 35 financing/lending companies due to various violations of applicable rules and regulations. A total of 58 online lending applications have likewise been ordered to cease operations for lack of authority to operate as a lending or financing company.

In a resolution dated September 3, state prosecutors found probable cause to charge Organico, its president and chairman Cerrone Roial Posas, and officers Marve Subere Posas, Renato Subong, Anthony Butaslac, and Karen Maasin for violations of Sections 8, 26.3, and 28 of Republic Act No. 8799, otherwise known as the Securities Regulation Code. (SRC), in relation to Section 6 of Republic Act No. 10175, or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.   The justice department also recommended the filing of charges against Kathleen Hortesano, Rochelle Camacho, and Annielyn O. Hilotin for acting as agents of Organico, offering and selling unauthorized securities to the public.   \\\\\\\\u201c(T)he business operations carried out by respondent Organico is in the form of a Ponzi scheme whereby purported returns to existing investors are culled from funds contributed by new investors,\\\\\\\\u201d the DOJ resolution read.   \\\\\\\\u201cIt is not an investment strategy but a gullibility scheme and which only works as long as there is an increasing number of new investors joining.\\\\\\\\u201d  The SEC, together with the Philippine National Police-Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (PNP-CIDG), filed a criminal complaint against Organico before the DOJ on September 10, 2019, for luring the public to invest in the company without the necessary license from the Commission.   Organico\\\\\\\\u2019s investment scheme involved the sale of a piglet for P3,600 each, with promised returns of P7,000 after three months. The company also engaged in crowdfunding activities through the internet where an investor should buy at least 10 shares worth P1,800 each, for a payout of P450 every 15 days or P2,700 in three months.  The SEC said Organico\\\\\\\\u2019s scheme involved the sale and offering for sale of securities in the form of investment contracts, whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits primarily from the efforts of others. Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  Section 8 of SRC provides that securities shall not be sold or offered for sale or distribution within the Philippines, without a registration statement duly filed with and approved by the SEC.  Meanwhile, Section 26.3 of the SRC states that it shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of any securities, to engage in any act, transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person.   Section 28 further adds that no person shall engage in the business of buying or selling securities in the country as a broker or dealer, or act as a salesman or an associated person of any broker or dealer unless registered as such with the Commission.   \\\\\\\\u201cThe records also consistently show that respondents constantly made use of the Internet, through Facebook and Facebook Messenger applications, to further disseminate information regarding their fraudulent scheme,\\\\\\\\u201d the DOJ resolution read.   \\\\\\\\u201cBy posting their offers of investments in their Facebook page and various group chats, they successfully reached a wider audience and was able to tempt or lure more victims to invest in their Ponzi scheme.\\\\\\\\u201d  Prior to the complaint, the SEC Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD) has issued an advisory on Organico as early as May 21, 2018 to warn the public about its illegal activities. The Commission then issued a cease and desist order against the company on May 28, 2019 and revoked its corporate registration on May 31, 2019.   In addition, the EIPD noted that Mr. Posas and his other co-accused Organico officers have a standing warrant of arrest issued by Judge Mario Duaves of the Davao Regional Trial Court Branch 15 for five counts of syndicated estafa. Operatives of the PNP-CIDG in Cebu City have since arrested Organico\\\\\\\\u2019s teller, Katherin Posas Diao, on the strength of the arrest warrant.

In a resolution dated August 2, the SEC Corporate Governance and Finance Department (CGFD) denied the Motion for Reconsideration filed by KingABC \\\\\\\\u2013 operator of online lending platforms Pondo Loan, Start Loan, Green Loan, and Loan Club \\\\\\\\u2013 for lack of merit.   \\\\\\\\u201cThe Department reiterates that the business of lending is imbued with public interest. As such, the Commission is mandated to see to it that only lending companies that are serious in their compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations are allowed to operate,\\\\\\\\u201d read the resolution, which became final and executory after KingABC failed to file an appeal within the allowed period.   The CGFD issued the revocation order on June 7 after finding that KingABC has committed 15 violations of SEC Memorandum Circular No. 18, Series of 2019 (SEC MC 18), which provides for the Prohibition on Unfair Debt Collection Practices of Financing Companies and Lending Companies.   The CGFD found KingABC to have threatened borrowers with shaming on social media by publishing their names as scammers and contacting people in the borrowers\\\\\\\\u2019 contact list despite not being named as co-makers or guarantors.   KingABC also used obscenities, insults, or profane language in its debt collection, and threatened to sue borrowers based on made-up legal bases, according to the CGFD.  The CGFD has previously penalized KingABC for its first and second violations of SEC MC 18. A third violation merits the imposition of either a monetary fine, suspension, or revocation of the company\\\\\\\\u2019s CA, depending on the facts, circumstances, and gravity of the case.   Aside from KingABC\\\\\\\\u2019s 15 violations, the CGFD noted that 53 more complaints have been filed against the company for its debt collection practices.   SEC MC 18 took effect on September 8, 2019, as part of the Commission\\\\\\\\u2019s response to several complaints for unreasonable, abusive, and unfair practices that lending and financing companies employed to collect debt from borrowers. Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  In its Motion for Reconsideration, KingABC argued that the 15 complaints merely contained allegations without proof, and that the volume of complaints by itself was not sufficient to justify the revocation of its CA, given that SEC MC 18 requires proof of those allegations.   The CGFD however maintained that the evidence on record more than adequately supported the revocation of KingABC\\\\\\\\u2019s CA. The department further emphasized that during its investigation, KingABC itself admitted that its agents committed \\\\\\\\u201cunlawful and unauthorized\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cunrighteous misconduct\\\\\\\\u201d towards its borrowers.   \\\\\\\\u201cA review of all the screenshots of messages submitted by the 15 complainants, including the 53 others who also filed complaints against the Respondents reveal commonalities and recurring patterns, including the substance of the threats and sentence construction of the said messages,\\\\\\\\u201d the August 2 resolution read.   \\\\\\\\u201cTo a reasonable mind, all these pieces of evidence prove Respondent committed 15 violations of SEC MC 18. Thus, it was only apt for the CGFD to find Respondent guilty of violating SEC MC 18 and impose the penalty of revocation of its license.\\\\\\\\u201d   END", "Date": "2021-09-22", "Regulatory": "SEC PH", "Title": "SEC UPHOLDS REVOCATION OF KINGABC LENDINGS LICENSE", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov.ph/pr-2021/sec-upholds-revocation-of-kingabc-lendings-license/", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "Philippines", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 67023, "unique_record_id": "5173445f1aSECPH20210922", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "668339d17858910306474240", "parse_date": "2024-07-01 23:20:20", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Non-compliance", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "No financial penalties mentioned.", "gpt_audience": "- Lending companies and financial institutions\n- Borrowers and consumers\n- Legal professionals and compliance officers\n- Regulatory bodies and government agencies\n- Investors and shareholders\n- Consumer protection organizations\n- Media and journalists covering financial news", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "No individuals are mentioned in the article.", "gpt_summary": "The SEC has upheld the revocation of KingABC Lending Corporation's license due to unfair debt collection practices, including threats, shaming on social media, and use of obscene language.

AGGREGATES\\\\\\\\u2019 FRAUDULENT,  DECEITFUL INVESTMENT SCHEME  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has ordered R.L. Aggregates and Diversified Lending Group, Inc. to stop soliciting investments from the public through a fraudulent scheme that involves the use of falsified registration documents.   In an order issued July 27, the SEC ordered R.L. Aggregates to immediately cease and desist from engaging in the unauthorized solicitation, offer and/or sale of securities in the form of investment contracts until the requisite registration statement is duly filed with and approved by the Commission.   The SEC further enjoined the company to cease its internet presence relating to the transactions and investment scheme covered by the order.   The company, along with its operators, directors, officers, representatives, salesmen, and agents, has likewise been prohibited from transacting any business involving funds in its depository banks, and from transferring, disposing, or conveying in any manner, any related assets to ensure the preservation of the assets of the investors.  The order extends to R.L. Aggregates\\\\\\\\u2019 directors, namely Roberto S. Llorente, Jennylyn M. Clemente, Patricio B. De Villa, Carlo S. Mamaril and Alvin C. Camanero, its operators, officers, representatives, salesmen, agents including Ashley Reyes, Maya Gonzalez, Randy Dela Cruz and Kenneth Daniel Papa, and any and all persons claiming, acting, and operating for and in their behalf.  The SEC issued the order after finding that R.L. Aggregates has been enticing the public to invest in the company in exchange for guaranteed returns of 1% per day or 30% per month over a lock-in period of three months.   The scheme requires potential investors to invest or deposit an amount ranging from P1,000 to P500,000, with dividends to be paid out every 15th and 30th of the month.   With this, an investor with a capital of P1,000 will supposedly earn P150 every 15 days, or a total of P1,900 after three months. Over the same period, those who invest P500,000 would receive a total of P950,000.   The scheme involves the sale and offer of securities to the public in the form of investment contracts, whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits primarily from the efforts of others, according to the SEC. Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  Section 8 of Republic Act No. 8799, or The Securities Regulation Code (SRC), provides that securities shall not be sold or offered for sale or distribution within the Philippines, without a registration statement duly filed with and approved by the SEC.  R.L. Aggregates is registered with the Commission and holds a Certificate of Authority to operate as a lending company. However, it has never secured a secondary license to solicit investments from the public, as required under Sections 8 and 12 of the SRC.   An investigation by the SEC Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD) revealed that R.L. Aggregates has been using an altered and falsified copy of its Articles of Incorporation (AoI), stating that \\\\\\\\u201cthe corporation shall direct solicit, accept or take investments/placements from the public and shall issue investment contracts.\\\\\\\\u201d  The EIPD also found that R.L. Aggregates falsely declared that it is a mother company of cooperative and lending groups that caters to agriculture, small businesses and small-scale mining in Masbate.   The Commission noted: \\\\\\\\u201cIn this case, R.L. Aggregates intentionally used or allowed the use of a falsified AoI to make it appear to the investing public that it was duly authorized by the Commission to solicit, offer, accept, sell and/or take investments from the public. Through the falsified AoI, R.L. Aggregates was able to conveniently offer and/or sell unauthorized securities from investors by means of fraud.\\\\\\\\u201d   Section 26 of the SRC prohibits fraudulent transactions relating to the purchase or sale of securities such as the employment of any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud and the engagement in any act, transaction, practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person.   The Commission further noted that R.L. Aggregates\\\\\\\\u2019 authorized capitalization was only P1.5 million, which would make its business model \\\\\\\\u201cnot sustainable and will likely cause grave or irreparable injury or prejudice to the investing public.\\\\\\\\u201d  \\\\\\\\u201cMoreover, the EIPD also pointed out that Respondent\\\\\\\\u2019s act of taking advantage of the pandemic to refuse any visit/transaction at its main office in Taytay, Rizal by its investors, and its insistence that investors only transact online, is questionable and suspect,\\\\\\\\u201d the order read.   The Commission warned the public against investing in R.L. Aggregates and other entities engaged in unauthorized investment-taking activities as early as February 23, 2021 through an advisory.

In a 17-page decision dated July 19, the CA Special 10th Division affirmed the cease and desist order (CDO) issued by the SEC against Planpromatrix for perpetrating fraud and causing grave injury to the investing public.   The Commission En Banc issued the CDO against Planpromatrix on July 16, 2019, after finding that the partnership offered and sold to the public securities in the form of investment contracts under the guise of an electronic loading business, without securing the requisite license from the SEC.  The investment scheme involved the solicitation of P600 to P1,850 of investments from the public, from which one can supposedly earn through an e-loading business, data entry job, and advertising package.    Planpromatrix filed a motion to lift the CDO, but the SEC denied the motion and declared the order permanent in a resolution dated November 11, 2019.   Subsequently, Planpromatrix filed a petition for review before the CA, assailing the validity of the CDO and resolution issued by the SEC, as well as the finding of the Commission that the partnership\\\\\\\\u2019s operations required a secondary license and registration statement, among others.  \\\\\\\\u201c[T]here is wisdom in the issuance and continuance of the CDO against petitioner,\\\\\\\\u201d the CA held, as it affirmed the findings of the SEC that the business activities of Planpromatrix involved the offer for sale of regulated securities and, thus, required a secondary license and registration statement pursuant to Sections 8 and 12 of Republic Act No. 8799, or The Securities Regulation Code (SRC).   The SEC found that the business activities of Planpromatrix partook the nature of an investment contract, where there is placement of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits derived primarily through the effort of others.   The CA took note of the implied admission made by Planpromatrix President and Chief Executive Officer George Naval, who did not dispute the contents of the advisory Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  issued by the SEC on February 9, 2018 during a meeting with the Commission\\\\\\\\u2019s Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD) on February 13, 2018.   \\\\\\\\u201cThere can be no debate on the authority of the SEC to issue the subject CDO, provided that the conditions therefor, i.e., that fraud has been perpetrated and grave injury is likely to be caused to the public, are extant,\\\\\\\\u201d the CA further noted.  The court cited Section 64.1 of the SRC, which provides that \\\\\\\\u201c[t]he Commission, after proper investigation or verification, motu proprio or upon verified complaint by any aggrieved party, may issue a cease and desist order without the necessity of a prior hearing if in its judgment the act or practice, unless restrained, will operate as a fraud on investors or is otherwise likely to cause grave or irreparable injury or prejudice to the investing public.\\\\\\\\u201d  The CA noted that the SEC issued the CDO only after receiving complaints against Planpromatrix and conducting an investigation into the partnership\\\\\\\\u2019s activities.   The SEC Markets and Securities Regulation Department, Corporate Governance and Finance Department, and Company Registration and Monitoring Department issued certifications that Planpromatrix had neither a secondary license to solicit investments from the public nor the requisite registration statement.   An investigation conducted by the EIPD, together with the SEC Legazpi Extension Office, also revealed that PPM did not have the required business permit.   \\\\\\\\u201cThose considerations and their supporting documents muster more than a mere scintilla of proof, and satisfy the required substantial evidence of fraud and grave injury committed against the investing public which are precisely the conditions sine qua non for the issuance by the SEC of the subject ex-parte CDO,\\\\\\\\u201d the CA held.   Accordingly, the appellate court ruled that the SEC did not violate due process with the issuance of the CDO, noting the order was not permanent or final and could have been refuted by evidence.  \\\\\\\\u201c[T]he subject CDO was not cast in stone that its efficacy and application are beyond challenge\\\\\\\\u2026 Petitioner had the opportunity to cause the recall of the CDO; it availed of the opportunity; and with that, it was accorded due process,\\\\\\\\u201d the CA further noted.

SEC ORDERS ROYAL O\\\\\\\\u2019 TO STOP LURING INVESTORS   The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has ordered Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019 Consultancy Services OPC, Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019 International Import and Export OPC, and their affiliate companies to stop soliciting investments from the public under a scheme disguised as an investment platform for alleged gambling, medical supplies, and export firms.    In an order issued August 12, the Commission directed the one person corporations (OPCs) to immediately cease and desist from selling and/or offering securities in the form of investment contracts until they have filed and secured the necessary license.  The SEC further enjoined Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019 from transacting business involving funds in its depository banks and from transferring, disposing, or conveying any related assets to ensure the preservation of the assets for the benefit of affected investors.   The order covers Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019s affiliate companies Oromagnet International EGames OPC, Plasmatech Medical Supplies Trading, and Princess Joana Jo Alfajid Foundation, as well as owner and chief executive officer Princess Joana Jo Alfajid Campos and president Gretchen Aguas.   The order also extends to representatives, salesmen, solicitors, agents, uplines, enablers and influencers, including Scelnna M. Jimenez, Christopher Dimaguila, Christopher Tundag, and Honeylyn Grace Israel.   The SEC issued the order after finding that Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019 has been offering and selling securities without securing a secondary license from the Commission.   Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019 offers two investment programs, depending on the amount an investor is willing to part with. An investment of P5,000 to P499,000 with a three-month contract would yield a daily return of 3%, or 201% in 67 days. An investor who places P500,000 to P10 million is guaranteed higher returns at 60% per month, or 360% for six months.   Member-investors could also earn by recruiting more people into the program, where they are promised an additional 6% for direct referrals and downlines.   The funds sourced from the public are then supposedly invested in various businesses being managed and operated by Ms. Campos, such as Oromagnet and Plasmatech.   The scheme involves the sale and offer of securities to the public in the form of investment contracts, whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits primarily from the efforts of others, according to the SEC. Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary S-309, 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  Section 8 of Republic Act No. 8799, or The Securities Regulation Code (SRC), provides that securities shall not be sold or offered for sale or distribution within the Philippines, without a registration statement duly filed with and approved by the SEC.  Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019 initially registered with the Department of Trade and Industry under the name Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019 Financial Consultancy Services, and subsequently as an OPC with the SEC. However, records show that it has never secured a secondary license from the Commission as issuer of securities or broker dealer nor registered any securities for public offering pursuant to the SRC.   Further, investigations by the SEC Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD) revealed that Oromagnet, which supposedly operates e-sabong activities and casino operations, has no license, accreditation, or any pending application to engage in such activities from the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation.   The EIPD likewise found that Plasmatech is not a registered medical device establishment with the Food and Drug Administration, nor does Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019 have any registration or certification to engage in the business of importation and exportation from the Bureau of Customs.   \\\\\\\\u201c[T]he investment scheme employed by Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019 has the characteristics of a Ponzi scheme as it promises exorbitant returns with little or no risk at all to investors\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d the order read.   \\\\\\\\u201cClearly, Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019s investment scheme is not sustainable because the time will come that no more new investors will come in, and this reality will likely cause grave or irreparable injury or prejudice to the investing public.\\\\\\\\u201d  The SEC highlighted that the certificate of registration granted to Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019 explicitly prohibited it from soliciting, accepting, or taking investments or placements from the public, as well as issuing investment contracts, without securing a secondary license.  The Commission warned the public against investing in Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019 and other entities engaged in unauthorized investment-taking activities as early as February 5, 2021 through an advisory, as well as through an investor alert posted on its official Facebook page on February 10, 2021.    \\\\\\\\u201c[T]he prompt issuance of a cease and desist order is warranted by the finding of this Commission that Royal O\\\\\\\\u2019s unauthorized investment-taking activities were made in violation of the SRC will likely defraud or cause grave or irreparable injury to the investing public,\\\\\\\\u201d according to the order.

In an order dated April 13, the SEC Corporate Governance and Finance Department (CGFD) found Familyhan liable for three violations of SEC Memorandum Circular No. 18, Series of 2019 (SEC MC 18), which provides for the Prohibition on Unfair Debt Collection Practices of Financing Companies and Lending Companies.   In addition, the CGFD found Familyhan to have committed eight violations of Republic Act No. 3765, or the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), in relation to SEC Memorandum Circular No. 7, Series of 2011 (SEC MC 7), which outlines the rules on the Implementation of the TILA to Enhance Loan Transaction Transparency.   Familyhan violated the prohibition on unfair debt collection practices when it contacted persons in the debtor\\\\\\\\u2019s contact list other than those named as guarantors or co-makers of the loan agreement, according to the CGFD.  \\\\\\\\u201cNotwithstanding the borrower\\\\\\\\u2019s consent, contacting the persons in the borrower\\\\\\\\u2019s contact list other than those who were named as guarantors or co-makers shall also constitute unfair debt collection practice,\\\\\\\\u201d the CGFD explained, citing Section 1(h) of SEC MC 18.   Whether or not contacting third parties in the borrower\\\\\\\\u2019s contact list was standard operating procedure for Familyhan prior to the issuance of SEC MC 18, the CGFD noted that the company should have changed its collection practices the moment such was prohibited by the memorandum circular.   SEC MC 18 took effect on September 8, 2019, as part of the Commission\\\\\\\\u2019s response to several complaints for unreasonable, abusive, and unfair practices that lending and financing companies employed to collect debt from borrowers.   \\\\\\\\u201cEnough time has been given to Respondent to adjust its collections procedure to conform with SEC MC 18,\\\\\\\\u201d the CGFD said. \\\\\\\\u201cThis violation cannot, therefore, be overlooked.\\\\\\\\u201d   Meanwhile, Familyhan violated SEC MC 7 when it failed to disclose the net proceeds of the loan to its borrowers. Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478   \\\\\\\\u201c[I]t is clear that the net proceeds of the loan is one of the minimum information that needs to be disclosed by a creditor to its borrower,\\\\\\\\u201d the CGFD said. \\\\\\\\u201cThus, missing such information, Respondent cannot contend that they have duly complied or substantially complied with the TILA.\\\\\\\\u201d  SEC MC 7 adopted the implementing rules of the TILA provided under Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Circular No. 730, Series of 2011 to enhance transparency in loan transactions and prevent the uninformed use of credit.  BSP Circular No. 730, Series of 2011 requires lenders to disclose to all types of borrowers the loan terms, including the total amount to be financed, finance charges, net proceeds of the loan, and the percentage that the finance charge bears to the total amount to be financed, prior to the consummation of the transaction.   \\\\\\\\u201cWherefore, in view of the foregoing, the Certificate of Authority to Operate as a Lending Company of Familyhan Credit Corporation is hereby revoked,\\\\\\\\u201d the CGFD held.  Familyhan subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration of the said order, however, the same was denied for lack of merit by the CGFD in a resolution dated June 18, 2021.  The SEC continues to monitor lending and financing companies for their compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.   So far, the Commission has cancelled the licenses of 35 financing/lending companies due to various violations of applicable rules and regulations.   The SEC has also revoked the certificate of registration of a total of 2,081 lending companies for their failure to secure the requisite certificate of authority, pursuant to Republic Act No. 9474, or the Lending Company Regulation Act of 2007.  Moreover, 58 online lending applications have been ordered to cease operations for lack of authority to operate as a lending or financing company.

In an order dated June 7, the SEC Corporate Governance and Finance Department (CGFD) found KingABC to have committed 15 violations of SEC Memorandum Circular No. 18, Series of 2019 (SEC MC 18), which provides for the Prohibition on Unfair Debt Collection Practices of Financing Companies and Lending Companies.   The CGFD found KingABC to have threatened borrowers with shaming on social media by publishing their names as scammers and contacting people in the borrowers\\\\\\\\u2019 contact list despite not being named as co-makers or guarantors.   KingABC also used obscenities, insults, or profane language in its debt collection, and threatened to sue borrowers based on made-up legal bases, according to the CGFD.  The CGFD has previously penalized KingABC for its first and second violations of SEC MC 18. A third violation merits the imposition of either a monetary fine, suspension, or revocation of the company\\\\\\\\u2019s CA, depending on the facts, circumstances, and gravity of the case.   \\\\\\\\u201cIt is likewise clear that at this point, the revocation of Respondent\\\\\\\\u2019s CA is not merely appropriate, but rather necessitated by the gravity and number of its offenses,\\\\\\\\u201d the CGFD said, noting that aside from KingABC\\\\\\\\u2019s 15 violations, 53 more complaints have been filed against the company for its debt collection practices, as of date of the order.   \\\\\\\\u201cEven more telling is the fact that subsequent to the issuance of the Formal Charge, the abusive collection practices of the Respondent only became worse and more hostile based on the evidence submitted by the complainants.

(VSI) violated multiple trading rules in facilitating transactions that eventually wiped out client shares in R&L Investments, Inc.   In a decision dated June 15, the Commission En Banc denied the appeal of VSI to reverse and set aside the resolution issued by Capital Markets Integrity Corporation (CMIC), which found the stock brokerage in violation of the self-regulatory organization\\\\\\\\u2019s rules and imposed a corresponding penalty of P5.16 million.    CMIC issued the assailed resolution on July 10, 2020 following the discovery of fraudulent transfers of client shares from R&L to the account of a certain Julieto Sulapas in VSI.  The transactions \\\\\\\\u2014 facilitated by one Marlo Moron on behalf of Mr. Sulapas while acting as a trading floor assistant and settlement clerk of R&L through EQ trades, or transfers of shares from one broker to another \\\\\\\\u2014 resulted in the loss of P700 million worth of client shares in R&L.  After conducting a special audit, CMIC found that VSI failed to properly record several transactions executed by and assigned to Mr. Sulapas. The multiple discrepancies in the records proved the failure of VSI to exercise due diligence, according to CMIC.  CMIC also noted that VSI allowed Mr. Sulapas to continue to execute trades and use its facilities notwithstanding the brokerage\\\\\\\\u2019s awareness that he has been trading considerably beyond his declared financial capacity.   Additionally, CMIC found that the associated person of VSI failed to properly supervise the activities of its employees, which resulted in the multiple violation of securities laws.  The Commission En Banc ruled that CMIC was able to prove by substantial evidence that VSI and its associated person violated the CMIC Rules in relation to the Implementing Guidelines of the Revised Trading Rules.  Accordingly, the Commission En Banc affirmed the findings of CMIC that VSI violated Article IX, Section 1(c) of the CMIC Rules, in relation to Article XVII(1) of the Implementing Guidelines; Article VII, Section 1 (q) of the CMIC Rules, in relation to  Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  Article IV, Section 4 (a) and Section 19 of the Revised Trading Rules; and Article XVI (1) and (5) of the Implementing Guidelines.   The brokerage also violated Article V, Section 3; Article VI, Section 1 (b) (iv); Article VI, Section 1 (b) (ii); and Article VI, Section 2 of the CMIC Rules.   \\\\\\\\u201c[T]he records show that Venture effected and executed a considerable number of transactions which the CMIC found and substantiated to have violated the CMIC Rules in relation to the Implementing Guidelines,\\\\\\\\u201d the decision read, noting that VSI itself admitted such violations although not in their entirety.   \\\\\\\\u201cIt bears emphasis that the development and integrity of the market also depends on the reliability of the records of its Trade Participants for it is in the proper and dutiful upkeep of these documents that the investing public derives confidence to participate in the economic activity and invest their hard earned money,\\\\\\\\u201d it added.  A special hearing panel (SHP) created by the SEC earlier issued separate decisions finding VSI, R&L, Mr. Moron and Mr. Sulapas liable for fraudulent transactions that led to the collapse of R&L in November 2019.  The SHP imposed a monetary penalty of P32 million against VSI and its officers. It further revoked the brokerage\\\\\\\\u2019s license and disqualified the key officers from performing similar functions in other companies.  The SHP also canceled the license of R&L and imposed a monetary penalty totaling P22 million on the brokerage and its officers, who were likewise disqualified from performing similar functions in the future.   Meanwhile, the SHP imposed a P2 million monetary fine for Mr. Moron and P1 million for Mr. Sulapas. In addition, the panel disqualified Messrs. Moron and Sulapas from being registered persons and officers, directors, or persons performing similar functions.

Exchange Commission (SEC) has revoked the license of R&L Investments, Inc., as well as disqualified its key officers and the owner of the account used to siphon off client shares from the stock brokerage.   In addition, the SHP imposed monetary penalties totaling P25 million against the brokerage, its key officers and the client involved in the fraudulent scheme that led to the collapse of one of the country\\\\\\\\u2019s oldest stock brokerages.  In a decision dated June 11, the SHP found R&L, along with its president Joseph Lee, nominee and salesman Lucy Linda Lee, and associated person Jonathan Lee, liable for the fraudulent transfer of client shares to an account in another brokerage, Venture Securities, Inc. (VSI).  In separate decisions issued on June 11, the SHP likewise found Messrs. Marlo Moron and Julieto Sulapas liable for engaging in fraudulent transactions, in violation of Republic Act No. 8799, or The Securities Regulation Code (SRC), and its implementing rules and regulations (IRR).   Mr. Moron facilitated the transactions as a trading floor assistant and settlement clerk of R&L through EQ trades \\\\\\\\u2014 the transfer of shares between brokers \\\\\\\\u2014 while, at the same time, representing Mr. Sulapas in his transactions at VSI.   Documents submitted by R&L and VSI showed that a total of P1,130,508,721.09 worth of client shares in R&L were transferred to Mr. Sulapas\\\\\\\\u2019 account in VSI through the EQ trades executed by Mr. Moron from 2012 to 2019.   However, Mr. Sulapas\\\\\\\\u2019 ledger in R&L revealed that no such shares existed, and that the shares transferred to VSI actually came from the accounts of other clients of R&L.   The scheme resulted in the loss of P700 million worth of client shares in R&L and in the consequent deterioration of the brokerage\\\\\\\\u2019s financial condition, to the extent that it cannot readily meet the demands of its clients for the delivery of securities and/or payment of sales proceeds.   Investigation by the SEC Markets and Securities Regulation Department (MSRD) revealed that Ms. Lee gave Mr. Moron the necessary credentials to execute EQ trades.   Mr. Moron also received viewing access to R&L\\\\\\\\u2019s back-office system. As a result, he was able to access and acquire information pertaining to the shareholdings of all R&L Page 2 of 3 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  clients and to tamper with the business partner portfolio reports to match the back-office records, thereby hiding the fraudulent scheme.  The SHP noted that Ms. Lee was the only registered salesman in R&L and, thus, the only person allowed to access the order and trade management tool provided by the Philippine Stock Exchange for use by trading participants in executing trades and accessing market data.   Mr. Jonathan Lee admitted to knowing the granting of the authority to Mr. Moron, but did not take action on the matter.   Meanwhile, the SHP noted that Mr. Joseph Lee failed to perform his duty as president of R&L, as he even admitted to having no knowledge of the daily operations of the brokerage.   Accordingly, R&L violated SRC Rule 28.1.5, or the Registration of Salesmen and Associated Persons of Brokers Dealers; Rule 30.2.1 or the Ethical Standards Rules; Rule 30.2.1.2.3 or Capabilities; and Rule 30.2.6 or Supervision.   The brokerage likewise violated Rule 30.2.1.2.4. Information About Clients; Rule 34 or the Segregation and Limitation of Functions of Members, Brokers and Dealers; Rule 52.1 or Accounts and Records, Reports, Examination of Exchanges, Members, and Others; Rule 52.1.6 or the Customer Account Information Rule; and Rule 52.1.10 or the Monthly Securities Counts by Brokers Dealers.   The SHP imposed monetary penalties amounting to P6 million each for R&L, Mr. Joseph Lee and Mr. Jonathan Lee, and P4 million for Ms. Lee. It also disqualified Messrs. Joseph Lee and Joseph Lee from being registered persons, as well as from being an officer, member of the board of directors, or person performing similar functions for the latter.  In Mr. Moron\\\\\\\\u2019s case, the SHP found that he engaged in the buying and selling of securities without being registered or licensed as a trader, aside from fraudulently transferring shares from R&L to VSI using Mr. Sulapas\\\\\\\\u2019 accounts.  \\\\\\\\u201cThus, the Respondent should not get away from the consequences of his intentional wrongful acts which resulted to the prejudice and damage of R & L \\\\\\\\u2019 s  investors in the present case,\\\\\\\\u201d the decision read.   Meanwhile, the SHP found Mr. Sulapas to have violated Section 26 in relation to Section 54 of the SRC and its IRR for his participation in the fraudulent scheme. Page 3 of 3 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  \\\\\\\\u201cHe allowed himself and his accounts in R&L and Venture Securities to be used as a tool in the commission of the fraudulent scheme that resulted in the loss of large number securities that belonged to the clients of R&L,\\\\\\\\u201d the SHP concluded.   The SHP imposed a P2 million monetary fine for Mr. Moron and P1 million for Mr. Sulapas. In addition, the panel disqualified Messrs. Moron and Sulapas from being registered persons and officers, directors, or persons performing similar functions.  In a separate decision issued on the same day but announced earlier, the SHP likewise revoked the license of VSI and disqualified its key officers from performing similar functions, on top of the monetary fines totaling P32 million, for acts and omissions that have indispensably contributed to the losses incurred by R&L clients.  The decisions are without prejudice to any further action that the MSRD Investigation and Review Committee may institute on the basis of evidence that it may secure.    \\\\\\\\u201cWe cannot tolerate and ignore any act or omission on the part of those involved in the capital market which would violate the norm set by the securities law especially on the transactions and responsibilities of Broker Dealers and that would diminish or even just tend to diminish the faith of the investors on the integrity of the capital market,\\\\\\\\u201d the SHP noted.   \\\\\\\\u201c[I]t is totally unacceptable and unconscionable to place the Respondents\\\\\\\\u2019 act and imprimatur on these issues that seriously endanger the integrity of entire securities market.  For this Commission to cop-out and to close its eyes to these acts and deeds, while convenient, would be to abandon its duty of safeguarding public interest and the integrity of the capital market.\\\\\\\\u201d  Read the full text of the decisions on R&L and its officers, Mr. Moron, and Mr. Sulapas:  https://www.sec.gov.ph/decision-2021/sec-msrd-case-no-msrd-mid-2020-2/ https://www.sec.gov.ph/decision-2021/sec-msrd-case-no-msrd-mid-2020-4/ https://www.sec.gov.ph/decision-2021/sec-msrd-case-no-msrd-mid-2020-3/   END", "Date": "2021-06-15", "Regulatory": "SEC PH", "Title": "SEC CANCELS R&L INVESTMENTS LICENSE OVER FRAUD; SLAPS P25 MILLION FINE ON OFFICERS, CONSPIRATORS", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov.ph/pr-2021/sec-cancels-r-slaps-p25-million-fine-on-officers-conspirators/", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "Philippines", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 63631, "unique_record_id": "5b679f6033SECPH20210615", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "66824e2b785891030647334c", "parse_date": "2024-07-01 06:34:53", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "P25,000,000\nP6,000,000\nP6,000,000\nP6,000,000\nP4,000,000\nP2,000,000\nP1,000,000\nP32,000,000", "gpt_audience": "- Investors and clients of R&L Investments, Inc.\n- Officers and employees of stock brokerage firms\n- Regulatory and compliance professionals\n- Legal professionals specializing in securities law\n- Financial market analysts and commentators\n- Members of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\n- Other stock brokerage firms and their clients\n- Media and journalists covering financial markets and regulatory news", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "Joseph Lee, Lucy Linda Lee, Jonathan Lee, Marlo Moron, Julieto Sulapas", "gpt_summary": "The SEC revoked R&L Investments' license and fined its officers and conspirators P25 million for fraudulent activities.

8888-8141;8818-5478  14 June 2021  SEC REVOKES, FINES VENTURE SECURITIES FOR FRAUD LEADING TO R&L INVESTMENTS\\\\\\\\u2019 COLLAPSE  A special hearing panel (SHP) at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revoked the license of Venture Securities, Inc. (VSI) and imposed penalties totaling P32 million against the brokerage and its officers for the fraudulent transfer of client shares from R&L Investments, Inc.     In its decision dated June 11, the SHP found acts and omissions on the part of VSI and its officers that have \\\\\\\\u201cindispensably contributed to, if they had not been the proximate cause of, the losses incurred by the clients of R&L.\\\\\\\\u201d  Earlier in November 2019, the SEC ordered the Capital Markets Integrity Corporation (CMIC) to take over the operations of R&L following the discovery of unauthorized transfers of shares to the account of a certain Julieto Sulapas in VSI.   The transactions \\\\\\\\u2014 faciliated by one Marlo Moron on behalf of Mr. Sulapas while acting as a trading floor assistant and settlement clerk of R&L through EQ trades, or transfers of shares from one broker to another \\\\\\\\u2014 resulted in the loss of P700 million worth of client shares in R&L, one of the oldest brokerages in the Philippines.   On its part, VSI and its president Wilfred Racadio, associated person Adora Aguilar, salesman Loreto Balabis and settlement head Teresita Mosenabre failed to observe know-your-client procedures and other controls mandated by Republic Act No. 8799, or the Securities Regulation Code (SRC) and its implementing rules and regulations (IRR), the SHP concluded.  For one, the concerned officers of VSI were not present when Mr. Sulapas opened an account and failed to verify the authority of Mr. Moron to transact on behalf of Mr. Sulapas.   Separate investigations conducted by CMIC and the SEC Markets and Securities Regulation Department (MSRD) also revealed that Mr. Sulapas\\\\\\\\u2019 transactions under his VSI account amounting to P9,905,454,333.20 were \\\\\\\\u201cgrossly disproportionate\\\\\\\\u201d to his declared total net worth, liquid net worth, and annual income of less than P1 million, as reflected in his Customer Account Information Form as of October 2017.  Mr. Sulapas\\\\\\\\u2019 account ledger with VSI further showed that he made approximately 2,800 buy transactions from 2012 to 2019, even though he only made five cash payments during the same period. Page 2 of 3 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  Despite the discrepancies, Mr. Balabis, Ms. Aguilar, and Ms. Mosenabre did not inquire, verify, or review the transactions made by Mr. Sulapas.     Moreover, VSI and its officers failed to report suspicious transactions to the Anti-Money Laundering Council and somehow even helped Mr. Sulapas evade the reporting threshold by issuing multiple checks for amounts lower than P500,000.   The panel also noted that VSI failed to maintain and keep a current and complete set of its books and records in violation of the SRC and its IRR, and lacked clear customer acceptance policies and procedures, among others.   Accordingly, VSI violated multiple provisions of the SRC and its IRR such as SRC Rule 30.2.1 or the Ethical Standards Rules; Rule 30.2.1.2.3 or Capabilities; Rule 30.2.1.2.4, or the Information About Clients; Rule 48.2, or Prohibitions on Extension of Credit in relation to Rule 48.1 \\\\\\\\u2013 Margin; Rule 50, or on Purchases and Sales in Cash Account; Rule 52.1.2, or the Books and Records Rule; and Rule 52.1.6, or the Customer Account Information Rule.  \\\\\\\\u201cWe cannot tolerate and ignore any act or omission on the part of those involved in the capital market which would violate the norm set by the securities law especially on the transactions and responsibilities of Broker Dealers and that would diminish or even just tend to diminish the faith of the investors on the integrity of the capital market,\\\\\\\\u201d the SHP noted.  \\\\\\\\u201cLikewise, the practice of installing undiscerning persons in entities involved in the capital market cannot be tolerated, let alone allowed to perpetuate. This must be curbed by holding accountable those who consciously and willfully commit wrongful acts in the performance of their duties as officers, registered persons or employees.\\\\\\\\u201d  Accordingly, the SHP imposed monetary penalties amounting to P8 million for VSI, P9 million for Mr. Racadio, P8 million for Ms. Aguilar, P5 million for Mr. Balabis, and P2 million for Ms. Mosenabre.    The SHP also revoked the registration and license of VSI as broker/dealer pursuant to Section 29 of the SRC. Meanwhile, it disqualified Mr. Racadio, Ms. Aguilar, Mr. Balabis, and Ms. Mosenabre from being registered persons and, except Mr. Racadio, from being an officer, director, or person performing similar functions.  The decision is without prejudice to any further action that the Investigation and Review Committee of MSRD may institute on the basis of evidence that it may secure, including to institute further action to charge responsible persons on the actual count or occurrences of violations committed, among others.

Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478      27 April 2021  SEC CANCELS ECO HATCHERY\\\\\\\\u2019S CORPORATE REGISTRATION OVER UNAUTHORIZED INVESTMENT SCHEME  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revoked the corporate registration of Eco Hatchery and Trading Corporation for soliciting investments from the public through a Ponzi scheme.   The SEC Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD) issued the order on April 23 after finding that Eco Hatchery has been offering and soliciting investments without the necessary secondary license from the Commission.   In doing so, Eco Hatchery committed an ultra vires act under Section 44 of Republic Act No. 11232, or the Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines.   The company\\\\\\\\u2019s activities also constituted serious misrepresentation as to what it can do, to the great prejudice of or damage to the general public, a ground for the revocation of a corporation\\\\\\\\u2019s certificate of registration under Presidential Decree No. 902-A, the order read.   The Commission has warned the public against investing in Eco Hatchery as early as February 3, 2020 through an advisory. The company did not react to nor refute the advisory against it.   A show cause order was subsequently issued by the EIPD against Eco Hatchery, directing the company to explain why its certificate of incorporation should not be revoked.   Eco Hatchery entices the public to invest with the promise of earning 15% every 15 days in a span of four months. For example, an investment of P500 would yield a profit of P75 every 15 days, for a total of P1,100 after four months, including the original investment.   Meanwhile, a capital of P500,000 would earn P75,000 every 15 days, or a total of P1.1 million after four months, inclusive of the initial investment.  The company also claimed that it operated a hatchery in Quezon province as well as a physical office in Quezon City.   The EIPD noted that Eco Hatchery\\\\\\\\u2019s compensation plan partakes of the nature of securities, particularly an investment contract, whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits primarily from the efforts of others. Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary S-309, 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  As a form of security, investment contracts must be registered with the SEC before they can be offered or sold within the Philippines, pursuant to Section 8 of Republic Act No. 8799, or the Securities Regulation Code.   However, records of the Commission show that Eco Hatchery is not authorized to solicit investments from the public as it has not secured the prior registration and/or license for such activities.  The EIPD noted that Eco Hatchery\\\\\\\\u2019s main strategy is actually to earn from the recruitment of new members or investors, presented in the guise of running a prawn, shrimp, crab and fish farm.   \\\\\\\\u201cNecessarily, this scheme is unsustainable, as it must rely on a continuous inflow of new investors in order to make payouts to earlier investors,\\\\\\\\u201d read the order.   \\\\\\\\u201c[T]he scheme being offered by Eco Hatchery/Eco Hatchery and Trading Corporation is clearly in the nature of ponzi scheme where the profits or payouts shall be taken from incoming investors or additional pay-ins of existing members-investors considering that it does not have any underlying legitimate business from where it could source its promised return on investments to its investors.\\\\\\\\u201d  The EIPD also emphasized that Eco Hatchery\\\\\\\\u2019s Articles of Incorporation explicitly stated that it \\\\\\\\u201cshall not solicit, accept, or take investments/placements from the public neither shall it issue investment contracts.\\\\\\\\u201d   Further, the EIPD found Eco Hatchery to have committed fraud in the procurement of its registration, as its stockholders/directors/incorporators Jose Marie Baquiran, Symphony S. Mondragon, Abner A. Pacheco, Lorenzo N. Mendez, and Stephen R. Cervantes provided wrong addresses in its Articles of Incorporation.   \\\\\\\\u201cWHEREFORE, for violation of Section 44 of the Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines (R.A. 11232) in relation to Sections 8.1, 28.1 and 26.1 of the Securities Regulation Code, P.D. 902-A and Section 179 (j) of the RCCP, the Certificate of Incorporation and the registration of ECO HATCHERY AND TRADING CORPORATION as a corporation, is hereby REVOKED,\\\\\\\\u201d the order read.

Seven of the overselling incidents were caused by various deficiencies in HCCB's order management and algorithmic trading systems and demonstrate that HCCB did not have adequate controls to prevent the overselling orders.\\\\\\\\nFurther, the SFC found that HCCB, when carrying out its warrant market making activities, erroneously self-matched 370 warrant orders on 22 May 2020 after its market making engine (MME) restarted during the lunch trading break of SEHK.&nbsp;

The SFC forms the view that SCCL failed to demonstrate that it had conducted proper enquiries on the deposits and satisfactorily addressed the associated ML/TF risks.\\\\\\\\nThe SFC further found that SCCL's failure to put in place an effective ongoing monitoring system to detect suspicious trading patterns in client accounts rested in its failure to detect 3,783 self-matched trades in nine client accounts (Note 4).\\\\\\\\nThe SFC is of the view that SCCL's systems and controls were inadequate and ineffective, and failed to ensure compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML Guideline) and the Code of Conduct (Notes 5 &amp;

The SFC will commence disciplinary proceedings against these individuals in due course (Note 4).\\\\\\\\nCGMAL has taken remediation steps and enhancement measures to rectify and strengthen its internal controls in respect of IOIs and client facilitation activities, including the appointment of an independent reviewer to review and validate its controls framework.\\\\\\\\nMr Ashley Alder, the SFC's Chief Executive Officer, said: &ldquo;The severity of CGMAL's failures exposed a cture that encouraged chasing revenue at the expense of basic standards of honesty.&nbsp; As a rest, in the face of unrelenting commercial pressure to solicit more business and increase CGMAL's market share, deceptive practices were deployed at the expense of clients' best interest and to the detriment of market integrity.&rdquo;\\\\\\\\n&ldquo;The sanction against CGMAL is warranted because it fell far short of the standards expected of licensed intermediaries.&nbsp; It also underscores the SFC's zero tolerance attitude in its determination to root out misconduct by licensed intermediaries,&rdquo; Mr Alder added.\\\\\\\\nMr Thomas Atkinson, the SFC's Executive Director of Enforcement, said: &ldquo;A key concern of the SFC is the failure of CGMAL's senior management to ensure the maintenance of appropriate standards of conduct and adherence to relevant regatory requirements, and to understand, manage and monitor its business and risks.&nbsp; The prevalence of the misconduct for a prolonged period reflects a failure on the part of CGMAL's senior management to properly discharge their management and supervisory responsibilities.&rdquo;\\\\\\\\n<strong>Mislabelled IOIs</strong>\\\\\\\\nSince at least 2008, CGMAL's Equities Sales Trading Desk had sent IOIs tagged as &ldquo;Natural&rdquo;, &ldquo;In Touch With&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;P:1&rdquo; to clients when there was no genuine client interest or specific client that CGMAL was in touch with (Note 5).\\\\\\\\nThese mislabelled IOIs, which were generated with reference to certain percentage of the average daily volumes of selected blue-chip stocks in the market, were designed to provoke client enquiries with the purported belief that traders wod be able to find natural opposite flows to cross with the client order given the active trading of the stocks and the size of CGMAL's trading platform.&nbsp; The Facilitation Desk of CGMAL wod step in to provide liquidity when traders failed to source natural liquidity on an agency basis upon client enquiry.\\\\\\\\nCGMAL's mislabelling of IOIs was not only contrary to the relevant industry guidelines that it claimed to have adopted but, more importantly, inconsistent with the fundamental principles of being honest with clients and treating them fairly.\\\\\\\\n<strong>Misrepresentation and non-disclosure to conceal the principal nature of facilitation trades</strong>\\\\\\\\nThe SFC reviewed 174 sample facilitation trades executed by CGMAL's various trading desks from January 2014 to December 2018 and found that in 127 of them, the heads and traders of the desks:\\\\\\\\ngave factually incorrect information to the client or took positive steps to conceal the principal nature of the trade;\\\\\\\\nmade misleading statements that cod be interpreted by the client as indicating that the trade wod be executed on an agency basis, or sometimes remained silent notwithstanding some indication of the client's belief that the trade was an agency trade; and/or\\\\\\\\nremained silent or were not explicit with the client about the involvement of the Facilitation Desk and failed to obtain client's consent before routing the client's order to the Facilitation Desk for execution (Note 6).\\\\\\\\nClients generally prefer transactions on an agency basis (ie, natural liquidity) over facilitation.&nbsp; By misrepresenting a facilitation trade as an agency trade or refraining from informing the client about the involvement of the Facilitation Desk, CGMAL cod avoid losing a trade to a competitor.\\\\\\\\n<strong>Internal control failures</strong>\\\\\\\\nThe prevalence of the misconduct among the desks over a period of more than 10 years indicates serious and systemic lapses across CGMAL's controls framework and its first and second lines of defence.&nbsp; In particar, before November 2018, CGMAL failed to:\\\\\\\\nput in place any policies or controls to monitor the issuance of &ldquo;In Touch With&rdquo; and &ldquo;P:1&rdquo; IOIs and ensure that such IOIs were backed by specific client interest;\\\\\\\\nhave adequate internal guidelines and enforce them in relation to pre-trade disclosure of and obtaining client consent for facilitation trades.&nbsp; Instead, CGMAL deliberately excluded the requirement for obtaining client consent for facilitation trades when revising its compliance guidelines in 2018;\\\\\\\\nimplement effective compliance monitoring in respect of its facilitation activities to ensure that traders had made pre-trade disclosure of CGMAL's principal capacity and obtained clients' prior consent;\\\\\\\\nprovide training to traders on IOIs and pre-trade consent for facilitation activities;\\\\\\\\nrecord and monitor communications and ensure sufficient segregation between agency and facilitation desks; and\\\\\\\\nidentify and rectify system errors that had led to the sending of erroneous post-trade messages to clients, which incorrectly indicated that CGMAL acted in an agency capacity when in fact it acted as principal (Note 7).\\\\\\\\nSince at least 2014, CGMAL had mtiple opportunities to identify and rectify the above failures but failed to do so until the misconduct was discovered during an SFC on-site inspection in late 2018 (Note 8).\\\\\\\\nThe SFC considers that CGMAL has failed to comply with various provisions in the Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC, and the Management, Supervision and Internal Control Guidelines for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC (Note 9).\\\\\\\\nIn deciding the disciplinary sanctions, the SFC took into account all relevant circumstances, including:\\\\\\\\nthe dissemination of mislabelled IOIs, misrepresentation of the source of liquidity when executing facilitation trades and the exclusion of the requirement for prior consent for facilitation trades from CGMAL's internal guidelines were dishonest and intentional;\\\\\\\\nthe duration of the misconduct exceeded 10 years and only came to light as a rest of the inspection in 2018;\\\\\\\\nCGMAL's senior management turned a blind eye to the misconduct by allowing the desks to adopt mislabelled IOIs and perpetrate misrepresentation with a view to achieving business growth;\\\\\\\\nCGMAL's compliance function failed to properly discharge its duties;\\\\\\\\nCGMAL has since then taken disciplinary actions against and summarily dismissed employees who had engaged in the misconduct;\\\\\\\\nCGMAL has taken remediation steps and enhancement measures to stop the misconduct and address the SFC's regatory concerns;\\\\\\\\nCGMAL's cooperation with the SFC in resolving the SFC's concerns and accepting the SFC's findings and disciplinary action; and\\\\\\\\na strong message needs to be sent to the industry to deter other market participants from permitting similar failures to occur.\\\\\\\\nEnd\\\\\\\\nNotes:\\\\\\\\nCGMAL is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts), Type 4 (advising on securities), Type 5 (advising on futures contracts), Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) and Type 7 (providing automated trading services) regated activities.\\\\\\\\nAn IOI is a widely used form of advertisement or representation made by licensed corporations to clients as a way to source potential clients with an interest in trading.\\\\\\\\nIn an agency trade, the licensed corporation acts as agent to find a counterparty (ie, natural liquidity) to cross with the client's order.&nbsp; In a facilitation trade, the licensed corporation acts as principal and ffils the client's order by buying or selling the securities from/to the client using the firm's capital.\\\\\\\\nThe SFC is of the view that senior management of a licensed corporation includes, among others, directors of the corporation, responsible officers of the corporation, and Managers-In-Charge of Core Functions.&nbsp;

According to the AFME Framework, &ldquo;P:1&rdquo; or &ldquo;In Touch With&rdquo; IOIs can be issued where there is a reasonable expectation of interest from a specific client and resting trades are expected to be of a riskless nature.\\\\\\\\nThe SFC has not reviewed any facilitation trades prior to 2014 since CGMAL no longer retained audio records for such period.\\\\\\\\nThe messages were sent via Financial Information eXchange, an electronic communications protocol for the international real-time exchange of securities transaction information.\\\\\\\\nIn Jy 2014, CGMAL's senior management attended a roundtable meeting with the SFC, during which attendees' attention was drawn to common deficiencies found in client facilitation activities in the market, including missing explicit client consent and lack of independent checking of client consent.&nbsp; CGMAL conducted a gap analysis following the meeting but failed to identify the misconduct or rectify the failures.&nbsp; On <a href=\"https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circar/intermediaries/supervision/doc?refNo=18EC11\" target=\"_blank\">14 February 2018</a>, the SFC published a circar to licensed corporations on client facilitation, providing further guidance on the standards of conduct and internal controls the SFC expects of firms providing client facilitation services.&nbsp;

Limited (ACL) $5.5 million for failing to discharge its duties as the sponsor in the listing application of COCCI International Limited (COCCI) between 2016 and 2017 (Notes 1 to 3).\\\\\\\\nThe disciplinary action followed the SFC's investigation which found that ACL failed to:\\\\\\\\nconduct adequate due diligence on suspicious cash settlements received by COCCI and keep proper records of its due diligence work;\\\\\\\\nascertain the background and independence of a major wholesale distributor of COCCI (Distributor) and its associates, and to assess the reasonableness of COCCI's sales to the Distributor (Note 4); and\\\\\\\\ncritically assess the reliability of the shipping documents provided to it by COCCI.\\\\\\\\nThe SFC has also suspended the licence of Mr Howard Tang Ho Wai for 17 months from 15 October 2021 to 14 March 2023 for failing to discharge his duties as a responsible officer and sponsor principal of ACL in charge of supervision of the execution of COCCI's listing application (Note 5).\\\\\\\\n<em><strong>Failure to conduct adequate due diligence on suspicious cash settlements</strong></em>\\\\\\\\nACL's due diligence identified that the Distributor had made cash settlements totalling RMB9.72 million to COCCI between March and June 2016 through various third parties, with one of the third party payers being an employee of COCCI's major supplier.\\\\\\\\nSettlement of payments through third parties by a customer is a red flag as they might be used to disguise the original source of funds and facilitate a fraudent scheme.\\\\\\\\nHowever, ACL failed to critically assess the reasons behind the third party cash settlement arrangement, nor did it conduct any independent due diligence to ascertain the truth and completeness of COCCI's representations in this respect.&nbsp; ACL also failed to maintain any records to demonstrate the due diligence it conducted, including its alleged discussions with COCCI's directors and reporting accountants regarding the third party cash settlement arrangement.\\\\\\\\n<em><strong>Failure to ascertain the background and independence of the Distributor and its associates</strong></em>\\\\\\\\nACL was aware that the Distributor's business activities were carried out by its sole shareholder (Ms A) and members of staff from her jewellery company.\\\\\\\\nThere was also information suggesting a connection between Ms A's jewellery company and COCCI.&nbsp; On the one hand, one of the co-owners of Ms A's jewellery company was a company solely owned by an indirect shareholder (Mr X) of COCCI.&nbsp; On the other hand, one of the directors (Mr Y) of the jewellery company was also a director of COCCI's major supplier, as well as a director and sole shareholder of a company which is a franchisee of COCCI and a management agent of certain self-operated retail outlets of COCCI.\\\\\\\\nACL failed to undertake any additional due diligence to ascertain the involvement of Mr X and Mr Y in the Distributor's business activities, and verify the independence of the Distributor or its sole shareholder, Ms A, from COCCI and its supplier.\\\\\\\\n<strong><em>Failure to assess the reasonableness of COCCI's sales to the Distributor</em> </strong>\\\\\\\\nSince COCCI's revenue in 2015 rose significantly as a rest of its sales to the Distributor&nbsp;and a substantial portion of COCCI's products was allegedly timately sold to end customers in Saudi Arabia via the Distributor, it was imperative for ACL to conduct adequate due diligence to assess the reasonableness of such sales.\\\\\\\\nHowever, ACL had performed minimal due diligence regarding the sales of COCCI's products in Saudi Arabia before submission of the listing application.&nbsp; While ACL had attended a telephone interview (conducted by COCCI's reporting accountants) with a major Saudi Arabian customer of the Distributor, ACL did not seek to obtain any objective data to verify information provided by the customer, nor did it conduct any independent search on the customer's background and scale of operations in Saudi Arabia (Note 6).\\\\\\\\nIt was only after ACL received comments made by the regators after submission of the listing application that it performed further due diligence, such as interviewing the Saudi Arabian customer and visiting its retail stores in Saudi Arabia.\\\\\\\\n<em><strong>Failure to critically assess the reliability of the shipping documents provided by COCCI</strong></em>\\\\\\\\nACL obtained from COCCI a total of 25 sets of shipping documents in relation to the shipment of COCCI's products from the Distributor to the Saudi Arabian customer.&nbsp; However, it did not critically assess the reliability of the shipping documents before relying on them as part of its due diligence, and failed to identify red flags which cast doubt on the reliability of the shipping documents.\\\\\\\\nThe SFC is of the view that ACL's conduct fell below the standard expect of it as a sponsor and breached the requirements under Chapter 17 of the Code of Conduct (Note 7).&nbsp; The SFC also considers that ACL's failures are attributable to Tang's failure to discharge his duties as a sponsor principal, a responsible officer and a member of the senior management of ACL.\\\\\\\\nIn deciding the disciplinary sanction, the SFC took into account all relevant circumstances, including:\\\\\\\\nsubstandard due diligence work of sponsors cod assist the listing of companies that are, in fact, not suitable for listing;\\\\\\\\nas COCCI's listing application had lapsed, no harm has been caused to members of the investing public;\\\\\\\\nthe SFC has previously issued two compliance advice letters to ACL in respect of its conduct as a sponsor in two separate listing applications, which shod have put it on heightened alert of the need to improve its due diligence work;\\\\\\\\nACL has no previous disciplinary record with the SFC;\\\\\\\\nACL's financial situation; and\\\\\\\\nACL and Tang cooperated with the SFC in resolving the SFC's concerns.\\\\\\\\nEnd\\\\\\\\nNotes:\\\\\\\\nACL is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on securities), Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) and Type 9 (asset management) regated activities.\\\\\\\\nACL was the sole sponsor in the listing application of COCCI on the Growth Enterprise Market of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.&nbsp; The application lapsed on 17 October 2017.\\\\\\\\nCOCCI together with its subsidiaries engaged in the design, marketing, retail sales and distribution of ladies-wear products under its self-owned brand &ldquo;COCCI&rdquo;.&nbsp; It sold ladies-wear through its retail outlets and franchisees, online retail platforms and wholesaling.\\\\\\\\nThe Distributor was COCCI's biggest customer during the track record period, ie, the two years ended 31 December 2016 and the four months ended 30 April 2016.&nbsp; The sales to the Distributor accounted for 50.2% and 23.3% of COCCI's total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 and the four months ended 30 April 2016.\\\\\\\\nTang has been approved by the SFC to act as a responsible officer of ACL in respect of its Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) and Type 1 (dealing in securities) regated activities since 22 May 2007 and 2 September 2020 respectively.&nbsp; Tang has also been approved to act as a sponsor principal of ACL since 11 February 2010.\\\\\\\\nAccording to ACL, a majority (estimated to be over 80% in 2015 and 100% in the four months ended 2016) of COCCI's products sold to the Distributor were re-distributed to this customer in Saudi Arabia.\\\\\\\\nCode of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the Securities and Futures Commission.", "Date": "2021-10-18", "Regulatory": "SFC", "Title": "SFC

S.A.\\\\\\\\nMillionaire sanction for Hope Funds S.A.\\\\\\\\nImportant remittance company, investigated for committing one of the biggest financial scams in Argentine history.\\\\\\\\nShare\\\\\\\\nShare on Facebook\\\\\\\\nShare on X\\\\\\\\nShare on Linkedin\\\\\\\\nShare on WhatsApp\\\\\\\\nShare on Telegram\\\\\\\\nPosted on Friday, April 16, 2021\\\\\\\\nWhile the criminal trial investigating Enrique Juan Blaksley Se\\\\\\\\xf1orans for laundering criminal assets in bankruptcy with illicit association through the company Hope Funds S.A., the Financial Information Unit (UIF) sanctioned the company and its director with a fine that exceeds 8 million pesos for not complying with its responsibility as an Obligated Subject.\\\\\\\\nAfter the administrative process, a resolution was issued that sanctions both Hope Funds S.A. and Hope Funds S.A. as well as Blaksley Se\\\\\\\\xf1orans, in his capacity as a member of the administrative body of the same, for failure to comply with special regulations that this type of companies must comply with to prevent crimes such as money laundering, corruption, financing of terrorism, fraud, tax evasion and other complex economic crimes. The fine ordered by the FIU is $4,881,545.- for both the company and the manager.\\\\\\\\nThe reason for the sanction applied to the company focused on not having declared maneuvers suspected of complex crimes (as detailed in Article 22 of the Law for Trust Funds) and other types of infractions committed, such as the lack of a manual of procedures and an annual audit system regarding the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as the absence of supporting documentation of the origin of the funds used in the operations analyzed and the omission of reports of suspicious operations. The sanctions applied aim at the prevention and deterrence of the aforementioned illicit acts, with a view to preventing companies from failing to comply with their obligations.\\\\\\\\nAbout the cause\\\\\\\\nOn February 18, the Federal Oral Court (TOF) No. 4 began the trial where Enrique Juan Blaksley Se\\\\\\\\xf1orans - who was considered the \\\\\\\\u201cArgentine Madoff\\\\\\\\u201d - is accused of having set up a network of companies that defrauded savers. It is estimated that more than 300 witnesses will testify. For this reason, Blaksley has been imprisoned in Ezeiza since September 2018, when prosecutor Alejandra Mangano and judge Mar\\\\\\\\xeda Servini accused him of being a co-author of an illicit association. The judicial investigation estimates that the amount of damage caused amounts to $1.5 billion pesos.\\\\\\\\nIn its actions, the company Hope Funds S.A. He used recognized brands, exhibited with renowned people and participated in events in order to obtain the trust of savers. However, in 2013, the Federal Public Revenue Administration (AFIP) detected serious inconsistencies in the justification of the origin of the money declared by Hope Funds S.A. Thus, the company would have carried out various maneuvers to carry out businesses that would lead to an exponential increase in its assets in just two years, going from 57 million pesos in 2010 to funds of 400 million in 2012. In this sense, The AFIP appeared before PROCELAC in 2014 to promote its research.\\\\\\\\nAlso prosecuted in the aforementioned criminal case are: Federico Dolinku\\\\\\\\xe9, administrative manager of Hope Funds; Alejandro Carozzino, accused of being in charge of forming companies abroad; Ver\\\\\\\\xf3nica Vega, the commercial manager of the company and Francisco, Mar\\\\\\\\xeda Rita and Juan Pablo Blaksley, who were attributed the same crimes as their brother Enrique and were considered members of the illicit association.

Accordingly, the FSCA hereby issues this Administrative Sanction Notice (the\\\\\\\\nNotice).\\\\\\\\n2.\\\\\\\\nNature of Non-compliance:\\\\\\\\n2.1.\\\\\\\\nIn terms of section 42(1) of the FIC Act read with Guidance Note 7 issued by\\\\\\\\nthe Financial Intelligence Centre (the FIC), an accountable institution must\\\\\\\\ndevelop, document, maintain and implement a programme for anti-money\\\\\\\\nlaundering and counter terrorist financing risk management compliance (also\\\\\\\\nreferred to as a Risk Management and Compliance Programme or RMCP).\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\nThe RMCP must enable the accountable institution to identify, assess,\\\\\\\\nmonitor, mitigate and manage the risk that the provision by the accountable\\\\\\\\ninstitution of products or services may involve or facilitate money laundering\\\\\\\\n(ML) activities or the financing of terrorist (TF) and related activities. The\\\\\\\\nRMCP must determine the processes by which enhanced due diligence is\\\\\\\\nconducted for higher risk business relationships and when simplified\\\\\\\\ncustomer due diligence might be permitted in the institution.\\\\\\\\nDuring the inspection conducted on 11 to 13 November 2019, it was noted\\\\\\\\nthat MAXI did not have its own RMCP in terms of section 42(1) of the FIC\\\\\\\\nAct.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) received a reference from the Office of Director General of Income Tax (Investigation), Delhi vide letter dated February 2, 2015 alleging manipulation in the scrip of Mystic Electronics Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cCompany\\\\\\\\u201d/ \\\\\\\\u201cMEL\\\\\\\\u201d). Based on the same, SEBI conducted an investigation to determine whether any act or omission by certain entities amounted to manipulation of the price of the scrip through their trades by indulging in and executing trades above the Last Traded Price (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cLTP\\\\\\\\u201d) during the period March 19, 2013 to March 31, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cinvestigation period\\\\\\\\u201d). Pursuant to the completion of the investigation and observations contained therein, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings in respect of certain entities, including Lagan Dealtrade Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) under the provisions of section 15 HA of the Securities and Exchange Board ofPage 2 of 7 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) for the alleged violation of Regulations 3(a) (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (e) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) by the Noticee. APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  2. In the said matter, the undersigned was initially appointed as the Adjudicating Officer (\\\\\\\\u2018AO\\\\\\\\u2019) by SEBI vide order dated July 4, 2016 under section 15 I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAdjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge the aforesaid allegations leveled against the Noticee under the provisions of section 15 HA of the SEBI Act. Pursuant to the transfer of the undersigned to another department of SEBI, Dr. Anitha Anoop was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, vide order dated March 18, 2019. Subsequently, due to the transfer of Dr. Anitha Anoop, the undersigned was once again appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, vide communique dated November 3, 2020. SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  3.  Show Cause Notice dated December 20, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee  under Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules  to show-cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against the Noticee and penalty not be imposed on it under  Section 15HA of the SEBI Act for the alleged violation of the provisions of Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a) and (e) of PFUTP Regulations by the Noticee. The details in respect of the violation / non-compliance by the Noticee as observed from the SCN are as given below: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is alleged that a scheme was devised by MEL, the operators and the connected entities, including the Noticee by allotting shares on preferential allotment basis to various entities. It is alleged that the connected entities, including the Noticee increased the scrip price of MEL during the investigation period by placing the buy orders in the scrip at aPage 3 of 7 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited price higher than the last traded price and also by absorbing the sell orders that were available in the market which were placed at a higher price than the Last Traded Price (LTP) in MEL. Once the scrip price of MEL reached the desired level, the preferential allottees exited and the preferential allottees have allegedly made a profit of Rs. 39 crore. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is observed that MEL made a preferential allotment of 92,30,000 shares to 48 entities on June 7, 2013 to raise an amount of Rs. 56.06 crore and the shares were under lock-in for one year upto June 06, 2014. It is observed that the shares were allotted on preferential basis initially at Rs. 25 per share and subsequently, the same was  revised to Rs. 60.74 (based on 26 week average price).  Post lock-in period, it was observed that 14 allottees who were allotted shares in the preferential allotment have either fully or partly sold their holdings in MEL i.e. 86,71,828 shares were sold in patches (i.e these shares were sold after the stock split period and approximately 9.30% of the shares allotted through the preferential allotment were sold by the preferential allottees for a value of Rs. 39 crore). Once the preferential allottees have started to exit, the scrip price of MEL started to decline substantially. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 During the investigation period, it is observed that a total of 1629 entities had traded in the scrip of MEL, out of which 60 entities were observed to be connected to the operators and also to the promoter/director of MEL. These connections were established during the course of the investigations on the basis of common address, email id, companies/directors related to the operators and through off market transfers. (hereinafter referred to as \"Connected entities\"). \\\\\\\\uf0b7 From the LTP (Last traded price) analysis of the Trade/order log carried out during the period when the scrip price of MEL had witnessed sharp rise i.e the patch 1 of the investigation period, it is observed that the entities related to the company/ operators were the major contributors to the LTP in the Price Rise Patch and contributed substantially to the price rise of the scrip by entering into transactions at prices higher than the last traded price. By carrying out such trades repeatedly, the connected entities established price higher than the last traded price to increase thePage 4 of 7 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited price of the scrip during the price rise patch. \\\\\\\\uf0b7      It is alleged that the connected entities have contributed to the price rise of Rs. 1550.1 (net LTP) compared to the market Net LTP of Rs. 489.45. Further, it is observed that only 35 connected entities (of 60 entities) have contributed to positive LTP of Rs. 2777.80 which is 47% to market Positive LTP (Rs. 5875.95) in 2642 trades for a total volume of 11,44,294 shares. Further, the connected entities, bought 11.55 lac shares which is 40.79% of the market volume (price rise-Patch I) and contributed to 47% of market positive LTP. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is observed that the Noticee is one of the top 10 connected entities who contributed to the Positive LTP. The details regarding the trades  of the Noticee is as under: Client Name Operator Net LTP Positive LTP Negative LTP Zero LTP % of +ve LTP to total market +ve LTP Net LTP (in Rs.) Traded qnty No. of trades +ve LTP (in Rs.) Traded qnty No. of trades Negative LTP (in Rs.) Traded qnty No. of trades Zero LTP traded quantity No. of trades Lagan Dealtrade Pvt. Ltd. Devesh Upadhyay 45.4 82175 77 52.5 24822 9 -7.1 4283 5 53070 4 0.89  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is alleged that the connected entities, including the Noticee repeatedly traded and significantly contributed to the price rise in the scrip of MEL during the period, viz., March, 2013 to August, 2014 by placing buy orders at a higher price than the last traded price. Further, it is alleged that the top 10 connected entities carried out 346 trades during the price rise patch of which in 283 trades, the sell order were placed first. The connected entities, including the Noticee placed the buy orders and absorbed the sell orders and increased the scrip price during the pre-split period i.e patch 1 of the investigation period. It is observed that in 135 trading days during the price rise period, (out of total 326 trading days) daily average volume of 750 shares and trades of 5 trades were carried out in the scrip of MEL. Thus, with insignificant trades and average volume, artificial demand in the scrip of MEL was created by placing the buy orders at a price higher than the last traded price in the scrip. It isPage 5 of 7 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited alleged that the scrip price of MEL was inflated and manipulated. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Thus, it is alleged that during the period when the scrip price of MEL witnessed increase, the connected entities, including the Noticee had contributed to the artificial price rise in the scrip of MEL by absorbing the sell orders that were available in the market which was at a higher price than the LTP which is evident from the net LTP of connected entities that is much higher than net LTP of market. These entities, including the Noticee created misleading appearance of price movement and attracted other investors which resulted in further price rise. The connected entities including the Noticee created artificial price rise and interest, thereby inducing other investors to trade in the scrip. Thereafter, once the price reached the desired level, the preferential allottees exited at a higher price and thereby booked profits. 4. I find that the Show Cause Notice dated December 20, 2016 which was issued to the Noticee had returned undelivered with remarks \\\\\\\\u201cnot known\\\\\\\\u201d. In the interest of natural justice, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on July 3, 2019, vide hearing notice dated April 30, 2019. The notice could not be affixed at the last known address of the Noticee as the Noticee was not found at the given address. Therefore, the email address of the Noticee was obtained from the website of MCA and another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on August 18, 2020, vide email dated August 4, 2020 by the erstwhile Adjudicating Officer. However, the representatives on behalf of the Noticee failed to appear on the scheduled date of hearing. Thereafter, upon my appointment as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on January 21, 2021. However, the notice could neither be affixed nor could be served on the email address of the Noticee which was available as per records.  5. Thereafter, during the course of the proceedings, the status of the Noticee was ascertained from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) website. It was observed that the name of the Noticee has been struck-off from the list ofPage 6 of 7 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited companies by the Registrar of Companies, Kolkata (RoC) as on June 9, 2017. As per the Public Notice (Form No. STK-7), which was downloaded from the MCA website, a list of 8078 companies were attached as per the Notification issued by ROC, Kolkata in terms of sub-section (5) of section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013. I find that the name of the Noticee was mentioned in the said list (at sl.no. 3657 under CIN No U52190WB2011PTC160524). The Notification downloaded from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India, (www.mca.gov.in) website inter alia, mentioned the following: \\\\\\\\u201cThis is with respect to this Office\\\\\\\\u2019s Notice No. ROC/WB/STK/2017/1 dated 07/04/2017 in form STK 5. Notice is hereby published that pursuant to sub-section (5) of Section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013 the name of the Companies (as per Annexure \\\\\\\\u2013 8078 companies) have this day of 09/06/2017 been struck off the register of companies and the said companies are dissolved.\\\\\\\\u201d 6. It is an established fact that when a company\\\\\\\\u2019s name is struck-off from the RoC list and the company is also dissolved, then it is a non-existing company and the adjudication proceedings against the non-existing company is thus nullity. In this context, I would like to draw reference to a judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) vs Vived Marketing Services (P) Ltd., ITA NO. 273/2009 dated September 17, 2009 in which it was held that - \\\\\\\\u201cWhen the Assessing Officer passed the order of assessment against the respondent company, it had already been dissolved and struck off the register of the Registrar of companies under Section 560 of the Companies Act. In these circumstances, the Tribunal rightly held that there could not have been any assessment order passed against the company which was not in existence as on that date in the eyes of law it had already been dissolved. We are of the opinion that the view taken by the Tribunal is perfectly valid and in accordance with law.\\\\\\\\u201d   7. Further, Black\\\\\\\\u2019s Law Dictionary explains \\\\\\\\u2018dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 as termination or winding up. It further clarifies that the dissolution of a corporation is the termination of its legal existence. Strike off essentially means removing the name of the company from the Register maintained by the Registrar ofPage 7 of 7 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited Companies. It is like closure of the company and the company will not be in existence after being struck- off and cannot perform any operations.  8. It is pertinent to note that, in the context of the alleged manipulation in the scrip of MEL, in exercise the powers conferred under sections 11(1), 11(4) & 11 B of the SEBI Act, an order dated June 26, 2020 has already been passed by SEBI against certain persons/entities, including the Noticee wherein SEBI had restrained the Noticee from accessing the securities market. Vide the said order, the Noticee was also prohibited from accessing the securities market, directly or indirectly, and also restrained from buying, selling or dealing in securities, including units of mutual funds, either directly or indirectly, or in any other manner whatsoever, for a period of one year.  9. Therefore, in view of the facts and circumstances noted in the preceding paragraphs and also the fact that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been struck-off from the RoC list and also \\\\\\\\u2018dissolved\\\\\\\\u2019 as on June 9, 2017 as per the RoC notification, I conclude that the present adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee vide SCN dated December 20, 2016 cannot be proceeded with.  ORDER  10. In view of the above observations/findings and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against the Noticee viz. Lagan Dealtrade Private Limited vide SCN dated December 20, 2016.  11. In terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, copies of this order are being sent to the Noticee, viz., Lagan Dealtrade Private Limited and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

SQ and other related details. However, it is alleged that the Noticee had not disclosed about the outstanding debt (liabilities) of the aforementioned two subsidiary companies, which arose from the default of a settlement agreement. The aforementioned settlement agreement was in respect of sale of SQ and was entered into between the Noticee, SD and STS, erstwhile shareholders of SQ and the Purchasers. b) It is observed that the Noticee was aware of the fact that there was a default in payment by the Purchasers to the erstwhile shareholders and thus, the debt was devolved on SD and STS, but had failed to disclose the same to the Stock Exchanges.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) received a reference from the Office of Director General of Income Tax (Investigation), Delhi vide letter dated February 2, 2015 alleging manipulation in the scrip of Mystic Electronics Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cCompany\\\\\\\\u201d/ \\\\\\\\u201cMEL\\\\\\\\u201d). Based on the same, SEBI conducted an investigation to determine whether any act or omission by certain entities amounted to manipulation of the price of the scrip through their trades by indulging in and executing trades above the Last Traded Price (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cLTP\\\\\\\\u201d) during the period March 19, 2013 to March 31, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cinvestigation period\\\\\\\\u201d). Pursuant to the completion of the investigation and observations contained therein, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings in respect of certain entities, including Manifold Vinimay Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) under the provisions of section 15 HA of the Securities and Exchange BoardPage 2 of 7 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) for the alleged violation of Regulations 3(a) (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (e) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) by the Noticee. APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  2. In the said matter, the undersigned was initially appointed as the Adjudicating Officer (\\\\\\\\u2018AO\\\\\\\\u2019) by SEBI vide order dated July 4, 2016 under section 15 I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAdjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge the aforesaid allegations leveled against the Noticee under the provisions of section 15 HA of the SEBI Act. Pursuant to the transfer of the undersigned to another department of SEBI, Dr. Anitha Anoop was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, vide order dated March 18, 2019. Subsequently, due to the transfer of Dr. Anitha Anoop, the undersigned was once again appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, vide communique dated November 3, 2020.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  3.  Show Cause Notice dated December 20, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee  under Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules  to show-cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against the Noticee and penalty not be imposed on it under  Section 15HA of the SEBI Act for the alleged violation of the provisions of Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a) and (e) of PFUTP Regulations by the Noticee. The details in respect of the violation / non-compliance by the Noticee as observed from the SCN are as given below: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is alleged that a scheme was devised by MEL, the operators and the connected entities, including the Noticee by allotting shares on preferential allotment basis to various entities. It is alleged that the connected entities, including the Noticee increased the scrip price ofPage 3 of 7 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited MEL during the investigation period by placing the buy orders in the scrip at a price higher than the last traded price and also by absorbing the sell orders that were available in the market which were placed at a higher price than the Last Traded Price (LTP) in MEL. Once the scrip price of MEL reached the desired level, the preferential allottees exited and the preferential allottees have allegedly made a profit of Rs. 39 crore. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is observed that MEL made a preferential allotment of 92,30,000 shares to 48 entities on June 7, 2013 to raise an amount of Rs. 56.06 crore and the shares were under lock-in for one year upto June 06, 2014. It is observed that the shares were allotted on preferential basis initially at Rs. 25 per share and subsequently, the same was revised to Rs. 60.74 (based on 26 week average price).  Post lock-in period, it was observed that 14 allottees who were allotted shares in the preferential allotment have either fully or partly sold their holdings in MEL i.e. 86,71,828 shares were sold in patches (i.e these shares were sold after the stock split period and approximately 9.30% of the shares allotted through the preferential allotment were sold by the preferential allottees for a value of Rs. 39 crore). Once the preferential allottees have started to exit, the scrip price of MEL started to decline substantially. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 During the investigation period, it is observed that a total of 1629 entities had traded in the scrip of MEL, out of which 60 entities were observed to be connected to the operators and also to the promoter/director of MEL. These connections were established during the course of the investigations on the basis of common address, email id, companies/directors related to the operators and through off market transfers. (hereinafter referred to as \"Connected entities\"). \\\\\\\\uf0b7 From the LTP (Last traded price) analysis of the Trade/order log carried out during the period when the scrip price of MEL had witnessed sharp rise i.e the patch 1 of the investigation period, it is observed that the entities related to the company/ operators were the major contributors to the LTP in the Price Rise Patch and contributed substantially to the price rise of the scrip by entering into transactions at prices higher than the last traded price. By carrying out such trades repeatedly, the connectedPage 4 of 7 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited entities established price higher than the last traded price to increase the price of the scrip during the price rise patch. \\\\\\\\uf0b7      It is alleged that the connected entities have contributed to the price rise of Rs. 1550.1 (net LTP) compared to the market Net LTP of Rs. 489.45. Further, it is observed that only 35 connected entities (of 60 entities) have contributed to positive LTP of Rs. 2777.80 which is 47% to market Positive LTP (Rs. 5875.95) in 2642 trades for a total volume of 11,44,294 shares. Further, the connected entities, bought 11.55 lac shares which is 40.79% of the market volume (price rise-Patch I) and contributed to 47% of market positive LTP. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is observed that the Noticee is one of the top 10 connected entities who contributed to the Positive LTP. The details regarding the trades  of the Noticee is as under: Client Name Operator Net LTP Positive LTP Negative LTP Zero LTP % of +ve LTP to total market +ve LTP Net LTP (in Rs.) Traded qnty No. of trades +ve LTP (in Rs.) Traded qnty No. of trades Negative LTP (in Rs.) Traded qnty No. of trades Zero LTP traded quantity No. of trades Manifold Vinimay Pvt. Ltd. Devesh Upadhyay 81 29000 33 84.65 12316 23 -3.65 605 15 16079 373 1.44  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is alleged that the connected entities, including the Noticee repeatedly traded and significantly contributed to the price rise in the scrip of MEL during the period, viz., March, 2013 to August, 2014 by placing buy orders at a higher price than the last traded price. Further, it is alleged that the top 10 connected entities carried out 346 trades during the price rise patch of which in 283 trades, the sell order were placed first. The connected entities, including the Noticee placed the buy orders and absorbed the sell orders and increased the scrip price during the pre-split period i.e patch 1 of the investigation period. It is observed that in 135 trading days during the price rise period, (out of total 326 trading days) daily average volume of 750 shares and trades of 5 trades were carried out in the scrip of MEL. Thus, with insignificant trades and average volume, artificial demand in the scrip of MEL was created by placing the buy orders at a price higher than the last traded price in the scrip. It isPage 5 of 7 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited alleged that the scrip price of MEL was inflated and manipulated. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Thus, it is alleged that during the period when the scrip price of MEL witnessed increase, the connected entities, including the Noticee had contributed to the artificial price rise in the scrip of MEL by absorbing the sell orders that were available in the market which was at a higher price than the LTP which is evident from the net LTP of connected entities that is much higher than net LTP of market. These entities, including the Noticee created misleading appearance of price movement and attracted other investors which resulted in further price rise. The connected entities including the Noticee created artificial price rise and interest, thereby inducing other investors to trade in the scrip. Thereafter, once the price reached the desired level, the preferential allottees exited at a higher price and thereby booked profits. 4. I find that the Show Cause Notice dated December 20, 2016 was served on the Noticee on January 5, 2017. The same is evident from the postal confirmation. In the interest of natural justice, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on June 6, 2019, vide hearing notice dated April 30, 2019. The notice returned undelivered with the remark \\\\\\\\u201cinsufficient address\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, the email address of the Noticee was obtained from the website of MCA and another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on August 18, 2020, vide email dated August 4, 2020 by the erstwhile Adjudicating Officer. However, the representatives on behalf of the Noticee failed to appear on the scheduled date of hearing. Thereafter, upon my appointment as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on January 20, 2021. However, the notice could neither be affixed nor could be served on the email address of the Noticee which was available as per records.  5. Thereafter, during the course of the proceedings, the status of the Noticee was ascertained from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) website. It was observed that the name of the Noticee has been struck-off from the list of companies by the Registrar of Companies, Kolkata (RoC) as on NovemberPage 6 of 7 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited 13, 2018. As per the Public Notice (Form No. STK-7) authorized by the Assistant Registrar of Companies, Kolkata, in terms of sub-section (5) of section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013 and rule 9 of the Companies (Removal of Names of Companies from the Register of Companies) Rules, 2016, the following is mentioned:  \\\\\\\\u201cIn the matter of Companies Act, 2013 and of M/s Manifold Vinimay Private Limited, CIN U51909WB2010PTC156207 This is with respect to this Office\\\\\\\\u2019s Notice No. ROCKolkata/248(2)/001740/2017 dated 14/06/2017 application (Form STK 2) dated 03.06.2017 vide SRN G45235728 and notice in form STK 5 issued on date NA. Notice is hereby published that pursuant to sub-section (5) of Section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013 the name of M/s Manifold Vinimay Private Limited has this day of November been struck off the register of companies and the said Company is dissolved.\\\\\\\\u201d  6. It is an established fact that when a company\\\\\\\\u2019s name is struck-off from the RoC list and the company is also dissolved, then it is a non-existing company and the adjudication proceedings against the non-existing company is thus nullity. In this context, I would like to draw reference to a judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) vs Vived Marketing Services (P) Ltd., ITA NO. 273/2009 dated September 17, 2009 in which it was held that - \\\\\\\\u201cWhen the Assessing Officer passed the order of assessment against the respondent company, it had already been dissolved and struck off the register of the Registrar of companies under Section 560 of the Companies Act. In these circumstances, the Tribunal rightly held that there could not have been any assessment order passed against the company which was not in existence as on that date in the eyes of law it had already been dissolved. We are of the opinion that the view taken by the Tribunal is perfectly valid and in accordance with law.\\\\\\\\u201d   7. Further, Black\\\\\\\\u2019s Law Dictionary explains \\\\\\\\u2018dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 as termination or winding up. It further clarifies that the dissolution of a corporation is the termination of its legal existence. Strike off essentially means removing the name of the company from the Register maintained by the Registrar ofPage 7 of 7 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited Companies. It is like closure of the company and the company will not be in existence after being struck- off and cannot perform any operations.  8. It is pertinent to note that, in the context of the alleged manipulation in the scrip of MEL, in exercise the powers conferred under sections 11(1), 11(4) & 11 B of the SEBI Act, an order dated June 26, 2020 has already been passed by SEBI against certain persons/entities, including the Noticee wherein SEBI had restrained the Noticee from accessing the securities market. Vide the said order, the Noticee was also prohibited from accessing the securities market, directly or indirectly, and also restrained from buying, selling or dealing in securities, including units of mutual funds, either directly or indirectly, or in any other manner whatsoever, for a period of one year.  9. Therefore, in view of the facts and circumstances noted in the preceding paragraphs and also the fact that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been struck-off from the RoC list and also \\\\\\\\u2018dissolved\\\\\\\\u2019 as on November 13, 2018 as per the RoC notification, I conclude that the present adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee vide SCN dated December 20, 2016 cannot be proceeded with.  ORDER  10. In view of the above observations/findings and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against the Noticee viz. Manifold Vinimay Private Limited vide SCN dated December 20, 2016.  11. In terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, copies of this order are being sent to the Noticee, viz., Manifold Vinimay Private Limited and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

Ravi, Mr. Mohan Lall Chauhan and Mr. Damodar Prasad Dani (collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d) to show cause as to why suitable actions/directions in terms of Sections 11 (1), 11(4) and 11B of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) read with Section 12A of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (\\\\\\\\u201cSCRA\\\\\\\\u201d) should not be initiated against them for the alleged violation of the provisions of regulations Rule 19(A) of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 (\\\\\\\\u201cSCRR\\\\\\\\u201d) and clause 40A of Listing Agreement by all the Noticees for non-compliance of Minimum Public Shareholding (\\\\\\\\u201cMPS\\\\\\\\u201d) by Falcon and Dunlop.  3. The facts as set out in the SCN are as follows: 3.1. Manali Properties & Finance Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cManali\\\\\\\\u201d) is one of the group companies of Falcon and it also forms part of the Promoter Group of Falcon and Dunlop (Manali held 3.56% of shares of Falcon and 0.03% of shares of Dunlop as on quarter ended March, 2012). Another company Stephens Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cStephens\\\\\\\\u201d) is also one of the group companies of Dunlop. 3.2. Manali had granted a loan of Rs. 144.05 crore to Falcon on January 7, 2008. The said loan was later assigned to three companies viz., Regus Impex Private Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cRegus\\\\\\\\u201d), Suncap Commodities Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cSuncap\\\\\\\\u201d) and Salputri Commerce Private Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cSalputri\\\\\\\\u201d) vide separate Assignment Deeds dated February 9, 2012 (collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAssignee Companies\\\\\\\\u201d). Similarly, Stephens granted loan of Rs. 62,39,46,000/- to Dunlop on September 15, 2011, out of which an amount of Rs. 60,00,00,000/- was in turn assigned to Suncap, Regus and Salputri vide separate Assignment Deeds dated January 14, 2012.  As per the terms of the said Deeds, in the event of any default under the agreement by the borrower (Falcon/Dunlop) to repay any amount on demand, the assignees (viz. Suncap, Salputri and Regus) shall have the right to get either part of loan or entire loan converted into equity shares of Falcon/Dunlop in accordance with the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (\\\\\\\\u201cICDR Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). Further, it was also mentioned that the assignors___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Order in the matter of Falcon Tyres Limited and Dunlop India Limited                                        Page 3 of 53  (Manali/Stephens) would not be liable in case of any default by the borrowers (Falcon/Dunlop) to repay the amount to the assignees (viz. Suncap, Regus and Salputri). 3.3. It is observed that Manali and Stephens had assigned loans of over Rs. 200 crore to three entities namely Suncap, Salputri and Regus, which as per the submissions of Manali and Stephens were unrelated to them. Further, these three entities were hardly doing any business activity and their net worth was nowhere close to the amount of loan assigned to them. It was further observed that there was no collateral or other securities for the said loan. Further, as per the Deed of Assignment, the consideration for the said assigned loan was required to be repaid by Suncap, Salputri and Regus to Manali by October 31, 2012 or earlier, failing which penal interest would be charged from the entities by Manali / Stephens. However, no penal interest was imposed by Manali / Stephens, despite the fact that Suncap, Salputri and Regus started repayment only in April/May 2013.  3.4. Subsequently, Falcon in its Extra Ordinary General Meeting (\\\\\\\\u201cEOGM\\\\\\\\u201d) held on April 26, 2012 resolved to allot a total of 4,33,87,048 equity shares on a preferential basis to Suncap, Regus and Salputri against an outstanding loan of Rs.144,04,49,995/-. Similarly, Dunlop allotted 5,00,00,000 equity shares on a preferential basis to Suncap, Regus and Salputri against an outstanding loan of Rs. 60,00,00,000/- on April 28, 2012. The details regarding assignments of loans and the allotment of shares made by Falcon and Dunlop to the aforesaid entities are as under:  Falcon  Dunlop Sl.

As a result of the said preferential allotment of 4,33,87,048 equity shares to Suncap, Regus and Salputri on April 26, 2012 by Falcon, there was an increase in total share capital of Falcon from 3,40,85,532 shares to 7,74,72,580 shares. Similarly, the share capital of Dunlop also increased from 7,19,82,875 shares to 12,19,82,875 shares on April 28, 2012.  3.6. The details of the shareholding of Falcon and Dunlop the quarters ended March 2012, June 2012 and September 2012: Falcon Particulars Quarter ended March 2012  Quarter ended June 2012*  Quarter ended September 2012 No of shareholders No. Of shares % No of share holders No. Of shares % No of share holders No. Of shares % Promoter Holding 2 2,47,26,944 72.54 2 2,44,94,944 71.86 2  2,44,94,944  31.62 Public/Non-promoter Holding 4145 93,58,588 27.46 4402 95,90,588 28.14  4423   5,29,77,636  68.38 Total issued shares 4147 3,40,85,532 100.00 4404 3,40,85,532 100.00 4425 7,74,72,580 100.00 *As noted from the investigation report, Falcon failed to disclose the correct shareholding pattern for the quarter ended June 2012.

From the aforementioned tables, it is observed that the shareholding of preferential allotees viz. Suncap, Salputri and Regus, (i.e. total 56 % and 41% of shareholding held by them in Falcon and Dunlop respectively) were shown under the category of public. Accordingly, Falcon and Dunlop had declared their public shareholding as 68.38% and 61.65% and Promoter shareholding as 31.62% and 38.35% respectively. However, it is observed that if the Promoter shareholding of Falcon is taken along with the preferential allottees, it comes to 87.62% of total shares. Similarly, in the case of Dunlop, the Promoter shareholding taken together___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Order in the matter of Falcon Tyres Limited and Dunlop India Limited                                        Page 5 of 53  with the preferential allottees comes to 79.35% as on the date of allotment of preferential shares. 3.8. Thus, on the basis of the findings brought out in the foregoing paragraphs, it was alleged that the entire scheme of assignment of loan  by Manali and Stephens to three entiites namely Suncap, Salputri and Regus and subsequent conversion of the said loan into equity shares allotted by way of preferential allotment, was done by Falcon and Dunlop in collusion with their group companies and the three preferential allottees, with a view to avoid MPS requirement under clause 40A of Listing Agreement. The preferential allottees together with the promoter entities of Falcon were holding 87.62% of the total shares of Falcon and 79.35% of Dunlop as on the date of allotment of preferential shares. Due to the issuance of preferential allotment of shares to these three entities, the public shareholding of Falcon and Dunlop had been claimed to have crossed the required minimum of twenty-five percentage.   3.9. Therefore, it was alleged that the entire scheme of Falcon and Dunlop initially availing loan from Manali and Stephens, assignment of the said loan to the three entities namely Suncap, Salputri and Regus and subsequent conversion of the said loans into equity shares allotted by way of preferential allotment by Falcon and Dunlop in collusion with its group companies, Manali and Stephens, was with a view to avoid the MPS Requirement. Thus, it was alleged that Falcon and Dunlop have issued shares on preferential basis as mentioned above with an intention to circumvent the MPS requirement. With the issuance of equity shares on preferential allotment to Suncap, Salputri and Regus the public shareholding in Falcon and Dunlop fell below the required minimum of 25% which is in violation of the provisions of Rule 19(A) of SCRR and clause 40A of Listing Agreement. 3.10. Mr. Pawan Kumar Ruia and Mr. Sunil Bhansali were members of the Board of Directors of Falcon and Mr. Mohan Lall Chauhan and Mr. Damodar Prasad Dani were members of the Board of Directors of Dunlop. Mr. S. Ravi was also a member of Board of Directors in both Falcon and Dunlop during the relevant period. In view of the aforesaid findings of the investigation, it was alleged that Falcon and its Directors, viz. Mr. Pawan Kumar Ruia, Sunil Bhansali and Mr. S. Ravi (\\\\\\\\u201cNoticees 1-4\\\\\\\\u201d) and the Directors of Dunlop India Ltd., viz. Mr. S. Ravi (who is also Director in Falcon), Mr. Mohan Lall Chauhan, Mr. Damodar Prasad Dani___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Order in the matter of Falcon Tyres Limited and Dunlop India Limited                                        Page 6 of 53  (\\\\\\\\u201cNoticees 4-6\\\\\\\\u201d) have violated the provisions of Rule 19(A) of SCRR and clause 40A of Listing Agreement read with Regulation 38 and Regulations 103 of the SEBI LODR Regulations. 3.11. It is observed that vide order dated January 31, 2013, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court of Calcutta has directed winding up of Dunlop. 4. Based on the above, Noticees 1-6 were called upon to show cause as to why suitable directions under Sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act read with Section 12A of SCRA, should not be issued against them for the aforementioned alleged violations.   REPLY and HEARING 5. In response to the SCN, Mr. S. Ravi vide his email dated April 24, 2018 enclosed his resignation letter dated September 21, 2014 which states that due to health reasons he is stepping down from the Board of Falcon as a Director and his resignation letter dated July 18, 2014 which states that due to personal reasons he is stepping down from the Board of Dunlop as a Director. Vide letter dated May 10, 2018, he reiterated his earlier submission. 6. Mr. Sunil Bhansali vide his email dated May 15, 2018 inter alia submitted as follows: 6.1. He joined Falcon on September 30, 2008 as an employee Director and was relieved from the company with effect from November 16, 2012. He was stationed at Mysore factory and his job responsibilities were to take care of day to day factory operation particularly procurement of materials, logistics arrangements, optimization of production etc. 6.2. At the time of granting of loan by Manali to Falcon, he was not working with Falcon. Further the three companies are not part of the Promoter Group. 6.3. Board of Directors and EOGM had recommended / approved the share allotment on the basis of facts placed before them. Board Meeting and EOGM was also attended by the Independent Directors. 6.4. There is no evidence of wrong doing by him. 7. Mr. Pawan Kumar Ruia vide his letter dated June 19, 2018 requested for two weeks\\\\\\\\u2019 time to submit a reply to the SCN as it was difficult for him to retrieve documents or past record of Falcon and Dunlop as in Falcon, Interim Resolution Professional is appointed and Dunlop is under liquidation. Vide his letter dated August 31, 2018, Mr. Pawan Kumar Ruia inter alia submitted as follows:___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Order in the matter of Falcon Tyres Limited and Dunlop India Limited                                        Page 7 of 53  7.1. The loan of Rs. 144.05 crore was granted by Manali to Falcon in January, 2008 whereas assignment was done in February, 2012. Here the investigation is suggesting that Manali & Falcon along with alleged cohorts viz., Suncap, Salputri and Regus waited for more than four years to assign loan and then converted them in to equity to avoid MPS. The allegation made in the SCN is denied and it is stated that the time gap between the two events implies that the entire happenings were not pre-planned but was carried out of commercial considerations. 7.2. The assignment of loans was done by Manali. He was not on the Board nor was he related to the operation of Manali. So he cannot comment on the commercial arrangements and considerations entered by Manali with the three companies. Further, as per established law, it is the prerogative of the companies to regulate its business affairs and it is not open for the investigating agencies to question the same. 7.3. It is also alleged that the three companies viz., Suncap, Salputri and Regus worked in collusion with Manali and Stephens and subsequently with Falcon and Dunlop. However, no document or information has been put forward evidencing the same. The three companies are completely unrelated parties. Mere allegation that the entire transaction is a part of colourful device to avoid MPS requirements is a figment of imagination which cannot hold good in the absence of any evidence. 7.4. A copy of the report submitted by the investigating officer under Section 11C of SEBI Act has not been annexed to the SCN which impedes him from defending himself. 8. Mr. Sunil Bhansali vide his email dated January 12, 2019 resubmitted his earlier reply dated May 15, 2018. 9. Mr. S. Ravi vide his letter dated January 28, 2019 inter alia submitted as follows: 9.1. He was a Non-Executive Director in both Falcon and Dunlop and as a person with a technical background and industry experience, his involvement was limited to engagement in both the companies at the Board level, with the specific role of providing advisory technical support to project expansion and optimisation of operation of these companies. 9.2. The only occasion when the allegation made in the SCN came to his knowledge was in Board Meeting as an agenda point with necessary explanation provided by___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Order in the matter of Falcon Tyres Limited and Dunlop India Limited                                        Page 8 of 53  the Management / Operational team. The Board had the advantage of having vastly experienced Independent Directors as well, who also specifically questioned and dealt with the issues as presented to the Board at that time. The compliance department / secretary of the company also confirmed the information presented and accordingly EOGM was called to pass the resolution as per requirement after taking SEBI approval. All the information was reviewed by the Board and there was no reason to believe any information was amiss. 9.3. He had no access to or ever was required to dwell into any information beyond what was provided in the Board Meetings which were well debated and conducted in the presence of experienced Independent Directors with the Executive Chairman in the chair.   10. Noticees were granted an opportunity of hearing on March 6, 2019. The hearing notices were served on the Noticees through hand delivery / email / newspaper publication. On the day of scheduled hearing only Mr. Sunil Bhansali attended the hearing and inter alia made the following submissions: 10.1. I was an employee director based in Mysore. I did not know Manali or the other 3 companies named in the SCN.  10.2. I joined in September 2008 and left in November 2012.  10.3. Manali and Falcon have no common Director. They were being managed separately and during his directorship, there was no interference of any kind in Falcon\\\\\\\\u2019s management.  10.4. Mr. Ruia was the Chairman of Falcon but to my knowledge, he did not hold any shares in Falcon.  10.5. I was not a Director of Falcon when it had given loan to Manali.  10.6. The decision to assign the loan was that of Manali. When the decision to issue shares was to be taken, notice came to him mentioning that the loan cannot be repaid and therefore shares have to be issued. The decision was taken in normal course. 10.7. The agreements of assignment of loans were signed in Kolkata. I was not a signatory to them.  10.8. The three companies who received the shares were not Promoters of Falcon. I do not know how these companies have been classified as group companies.___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Order in the matter of Falcon Tyres Limited and Dunlop India Limited                                        Page 9 of 53  10.9. I did not attend most of the Board Meetings. I attended the meeting held in Mysore.  10.10. The alleged transaction did not result into any benefit to Falcon, so why would it commit a fraud.  11. Vide email dated January 20, 2020, Noticees were provided one more opportunity to make submissions in addition to what has already been made by them. 12. Mr. S. Ravi vide his letter dated January 29, 2020 reiterated his earlier submissions and inter alia submitted as follows: 12.1. His engagement in the company was only as a Non-Executive Director and for rendering technical advice given his engineering background. At no point of time he had any operational role and his interaction with the company was only on the basis of Board Meeting deliberations. 12.2. Based on the papers put up in the meeting, the Board which also included three Independent Directors of eminent stature as well, who were well versed in such matters, took cognizance of the fact that the companies are not part of any related companies as per statutory disclosures filed and decided to take action as per law and have it processed by EGM, Board, etc. 12.3. It is important to reiterate that his role as a Non - Executive Director, never called upon him to do any extra due diligence beyond reviewing/ examining what was presented to the Board and he was never privy to or had access to any information which was not presented to the Board. 12.4. He confirms that on the basis of information available to him at that time he had no reason to suspect any wrongdoing or falsification of information and the decision was taken as per the requirement of law duly vetted by the full Board and based on compliance details presented during the meeting. 13. Mr. Sunil Bhansali vide his email dated January 30, 2020 reiterated his earlier submissions and inter alia submitted as follows: 13.1. There is no common Director or shareholders between Suncap, Regus, Salputri and Falcon. 13.2. There are no documents/evidences in support of charges against him. 13.3. The 3 companies Suncap, Regus and Salputri never approached Falcon.  Manali has confirmed that these companies approached Manali and it was Manali\\\\\\\\u2019s decision to assign the loan to these 3 companies.___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Order in the matter of Falcon Tyres Limited and Dunlop India Limited                                        Page 10 of 53  13.4. As per details presented to him and Falcon Board, the 3 entities Suncap, Regus and Salputri were independent companies and had no connection with Falcon Director\\\\\\\\u2019s or Promoter\\\\\\\\u2019s.  Before presenting to the Board, the details were also vetted by the Compliance Officer and Committee, which comprises of professional experts. There is no reason /evidence for him to have a doubt about the details /information. 13.5. There was no collusion by him. The decision to assign the loan was taken by Manali and its management and he has no role and there is no document or evidence in support of the charge. 14. R. Bhargavan & Associates representing Mr. Pawn Kumar Ruia, vide its letter dated February 11, 2020 reiterated the submissions earlier made by its client. It further stated as follows: 14.1. There existed a valid debt. 14.2. Both Falcon and Dunlop have been wound up / liquidated. It ought to have been necessary to make these entities / representatives of these entities party to the investigation, failing which its client would be hard pressed to certify facts relevant to the SCN and risk proceeding on conjecture. 15. Mr. Mohan Lall Chauhan vide his letter dated February 12, 2020 requested for a copy of the SCN. The Noticee was provided with a copy of the SCN on the same day. In response to the SCN, he vide his letter dated February 28, 2020 inter alia stated as follows: 15.1. He was a Non-Executive Independent Director of Dunlop and was not engaged or in charge of the day to day management of the Dunlop. 15.2. As a retired Commissioner of Income Tax, he was approached to be appointed as Non-Executive Independent Director of Dunlop. During his tenure as the Director (September 25, 2009 to September 26, 2014), he did not receive salary but was paid sitting fees. 15.3. There is a gross delay in issuing the SCN and on this ground alone the SCN should be disposed of without any directions. 15.4.  Under SCRR and Listing Agreement, the liability to comply with the requirement of MPS is that of the company. The requirement to reduce the Promoter shareholding is on the Promoters. It is pertinent to note that the SCN has only been issued to former Directors and has not even been issued to the___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Order in the matter of Falcon Tyres Limited and Dunlop India Limited                                        Page 11 of 53  company. The SCN is therefore, not maintainable. 15.5. At the relevant time, it was represented to the Board that the transaction with Stephens was happening at arm\\\\\\\\u2019s length and the proceeds of the loan were to be used to fund the operations of Dunlop. Acting as Non-Executive Independent Director, he relied upon the documents placed before him by the management of the company. The necessary details, explanations, supporting details were duly verified and vetted by the Company secretary, legal department and same were presented before the Board and subsequently to the shareholders\\\\\\\\u2019 general body. All the details which were presented were verified and certified by the management of Dunlop. The said issue about the loan and the issuance of the shares upon conversion of debt to equity was widely discussed by the Board members and subsequently by the shareholders. To the best of his recollection, no issue whatsoever was raised by anyone at that time. Thus, at the relevant time, there was no reason to believe that any information or representations of the management was false or erroneous. The said shares were issued in accordance with ICDR Regulations and there was no allegation from the Exchanges about any non-compliance. 15.6. He relied upon the advice of the Vice President Legal and Company Secretary and the detailed explanatory statement that was submitted to the shareholders. To the best of his recollection, the resolution of the Board as well as shareholders was passed unanimously. 15.7. An Independent Director shall be held liable only in respect of such acts of omission or commission by a company which had occurred with his knowledge, attributable through Board processes and with his consent or connivance or where he had not acted diligently. 16. Mr. Damodar Dani vide his letter dated February 12, 2020 requested for a copy of the SCN. The Noticee was provided with a copy of the SCN on the same day. In response to the SCN, he vide his letter dated February 26, 2020 inter alia stated as follows: 16.1. He was a Non - Executive Director in Dunlop May 11, 2010 to January 26, 2013. During this period his role in the functioning of Dunlop was limited since he was an Independent Non-Executive Director. During his tenure of directorship, he was under constant guidance of the management and other Directors on the Board of Directors of the company. It is pertinent to note that in his capacity as a___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Order in the matter of Falcon Tyres Limited and Dunlop India Limited                                        Page 12 of 53  Non-Executive Director or Independent Director, he was not charged with the day to day affairs and management of the company and was merely involved in the decision making at the Board level based on the documents/explanations presented before the Board of Directors by the management team of the company. 16.2.  Before the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 28.04.2012 at Kolkata, he along with other Directors on the Board were informed by the management, VP Legal-Company Secretary of the company that the company had availed a corporate loan from Stephens vide Loan Agreement dated 15.09.2011 to fulfil long term working capital requirements. Subsequently it was brought to notice that Stephens had informed Dunlop that it had assigned its rights and obligations to Suncap, Regus and Salputri vide Deed of assignment dated 14.01.2012. The Assignees had accepted their respective rights and obligations and that the assignees had the right to convert the loan into equity upon failure by Dunlop to repay the loan. 16.3. Further, in order to effectuate the conversion of debt liability to equity of Dunlop, EGM had been called and two resolutions were sought to be passed in this regard. Firstly, a resolution to reclassify all unissued 1,00,70,000 Preference shares of Rs 100/- each to 10,07,00,000 Equity shares of Rs. 10/-. Secondly, issuance of 5,00,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each fully paid up on conversion of outstanding loan of Rs. 60,00,00,000/- to Suncap, Regus and Salputri on preferential basis. Therefore, upon the professional advice from the management through Vice President - Legal and Company Secretary as well as the detail explanatory note which was also circulated to the shareholders, the two resolutions were unanimously passed firstly by the Board of Directors in the Board meeting and later on by the shareholders present in the EGM held on 28.04.2012. 16.4. As per the explanatory note to the resolution it was clearly mentioned that the resolution was in accordance/subject to the applicable laws/SEBI guidelines. 16.5. It is an established position or law that in order to be liable, a person should fulfil the legal requirement of being a person in law who is responsible for the conduct or the business of the company. Non - Executive Directors are, therefore, persons who are not involved in the day to day affairs of the running of the___________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Order in the matter of Falcon Tyres Limited and Dunlop India Limited                                        Page 13 of 53  company and are not in charge of and not responsible for the conduct or the business or the company. Thus, even if there was any contravention of law carried out by the company, he as a Non - Executive Director of the company cannot be held responsible. 16.6. He had no reason to doubt the information/explanation provided to the Board of Directors relating to the resolutions in general or about the constitution / relationship of the assignee companies with Stephens in particular.  17.

DTL was again asked to confirm through emails dated July 16, July 19 and July 25, 2019 if the aforementioned disclosure was made to Calcutta Stock Exchange. However, no response was received.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING 9. In view of the above, a common notice (\\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) dated November 11, 2020, was issued to the Noticees by the undersigned, wherein it was alleged that the promoters of Dwitiya Trading Ltd. as named above, had failed to disclose their change in shareholding in the company and has therefore violated Regulation 13(4A) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992. The aforesaid violations, if established, would make the Noticees liable for penalty under section 15 A(b) of the SEBI Act. The contents of the said provisions of law is reproduced herein below:  Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc.   15A. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder,\\\\\\\\u2014 Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 6 of 20  (a) ******* (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations, he shall be liable to [a penalty [which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees]]; 10. The Noticees were therefore, asked to show cause vide the aforesaid notice as to why an inquiry should not be held against them in terms of Rule 4 of SEBI Adjudication Rules and penalty should not be imposed under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, 1992 for the aforesaid alleged contraventions by the Noticees. The aforesaid Notice was sent by email to the email addresses of the Noticees (except Noticee No.10) from which they have been corresponding in the present proceedings.  11. The Noticees (except Noticee No. 10) replied to the aforesaid SCN individually by various emails containing their replies, some of which were dated December 10, 2020 and the rest were dated December 15, 2020. The submissions of the Noticees are almost identical and one such reply is reproduced herein below:  \\\\\\\\u201cThe company Dwitiya Trading Limited came out with preferential allotment of 4800000 (Forty-Eight Lacs) equity shares in the year 2013. Preferential allotment of 4800000 equity shares was made in meeting of board of directors held on 10th May 2013. Special resolution for preferential allotment of Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 7 of 20  4800000 equity shares was passed in the extra ordinary general meeting of the shareholders held on 28th February 2013. Notice of above mentioned Extra Ordinary General meeting of the shareholder was sent to each and every shareholder of the company so each and every shareholders was fully aware about preferential allotment of 4800000 shares to non-promoters. Pre preferential allotment shareholding pattern and post preferential allotment shareholding pattern were disclosed in explanatory statement of notice of extra ordinary general meeting in which it was clearly mentioned that after preferential allotment total promoters holding shall be decreased from 28.8 % to 1.20 % due to preferential allotment made to non-promoters and since copy of notice was sent to each and every shareholder of the company so each and every shareholder of the company was fully aware about reduction in the promoters holding. The company has got all necessary approvals from Calcutta stock exchange for abovementioned preferential allotment and has completed all other statutory formalities.  3. I would like to submit that as per Regulation 13 (4A) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 any person who is a promoter or part of promoter group of a listed company shall disclose to the company and the stock exchanges where securities of the company are listed in form 'D' the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting right if there has been change in such holding of such person from the last disclosure made under listing agreement or under sub regulation 2(A) and under this sub- regulation, and the change exceeds Rs. 5 lacs in value or Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 8 of 20  25000 shares or 1 % of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower. As per regulation 13 (5 ) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading ) Regulations, 1992 disclosure mentioned under regulation 13 (3) &13 (4) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading ) Regulations, 1992 shall be made within two working days of receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be. So it is clear from regulation 13 (5) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 that disclosure under regulation 13 (4A) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 is applicable only when any person who is promoter or part of promoter group receipt intimation of allotment of shares or acquire or sale of shares or voting right. I would like to submit that I did not receive any intimation of allotment from company since I was not allotted a single share in the abovementioned preferential allotment and in line with provisions of Regulation 13(5), it is submitted that I am not required to file disclosures under Regulation 13(4A), since I was not allotted any equity share pursuant to preferential allotment made to the non-promoters on 10th May 2013.  4. It was alleged that shareholding of the promoters of the company reduced by more than 1% from quarter ending March 2013 to June 2013. I would like to submit that I held 4250 equity shares in quarter ending March 2013 in the company Dwitiya Trading Ltd. but my shareholding in the company reduced from 2.14% to .08% because company made a preferential allotment of 4800000 equity shares to non-promoters on 10th May 2013 and due to this Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 9 of 20  total equity shares of the company increased from 210000 to 5010000 from quarter ended March 2013 and my shareholding in company reduced from 2.14% to .08% from quarter ended March 2013 while I did not acquire or sell any shares from quarter ended March 2013 upto 10th May 2013 or not a single share was allotted to me in preferential allotment and I held same quantity of shares for quarter ended March 2013 and as on 10th May 2013 .  5. I hereby submit again that reduction by more than 1% from quarter ending March 2013 to 10th May 2013 is due to increase in equity share capital of the company by preferential allotment made to non-promoters on 10th May 2013 and not because that I acquired or sold or was allotted any shares of company from quarter ended March 2013 to 10th May 2013 .I did not acquire or sell any single share from quarter ended March 2013 to 10th May 2013 and not a single share was allotted to me in preferential allotment so provisions of Regulation 13(4A) read with Regulation 13(5) is not applicable to me because as per regulation 13 ( 5 ) of SEBI ( Prohibition of Insider Trading ) Regulations, 1992 disclosure mentioned under regulation 13(4A) of SEBI ( Prohibition of Insider Trading ) Regulations, 1992 shall be made within two working days of receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights as the case may be. 6. I would further like to submit that I sold my shares on 14th June, 2013 @ Rs. l0 Per Share so total sale consideration was Rs. 42500. My shareholding in company had already been reduced from 2.14% to .08% from quarter ended March 2013 to 10th May 2013 due to preferential allotment made to non- Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 10 of 20  promoters so when I sold my shares on 14thJune, 2013, my shareholding in the company reduced from .09 % to NIL (0%). I would like to submit that disclosure under Regulation 13(4A) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations,1992 is applicable when the change exceeds Rs. 5 lacs in value or 25000 shares or 1 % of total shareholding or voting rights whichever is lower.  7. In line with this I would like to submit disclosure under regulation 13 (4A) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 is not applicable to me because:  (A) I sold 4250 equity shares on 14thJune, 2013 which is less than 25000 and as per regulation 13 (4A) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading), Regulations, 1992 disclosure is applicable when the change exceeds 25000 shares so disclosure under regulation 13 (4A) is not applicable to me.  (B) I sold 4250 equity shares @ 10 per share and total sale consideration was Rs. 42500 which is less than Rs. 5 lacs in value and as per regulation 13 (4 A) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading), Regulations, 1992 disclosure is applicable when the change exceeds Rs. 5 lacs in Value so disclosure under regulation 13 (4 A) is not applicable to me.  (c) I sold only .08% holding on 14thJune, 2013 which is less than 1 (one) % of total shareholding of the company and as per regulation 13 (4 A) SEBI Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 11 of 20  (Prohibition of Insider Trading), Regulations, 1992 disclosure is applicable when the change exceeds 1 % of total shareholding of the company so disclosure under regulation 13 (4 A) is not applicable to me. So It is clear that disclosure under regulation 13 (4A) SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading), Regulations, 1992 is not applicable to me at the time of sale of shares on 14th June, 2013 because I sold less than 25000 shares and less than 1 % of total shareholding of company and sale consideration was less than Rs. 5 Lacs in value.  8. I would further like to submit that since all the information were in public domain and since notice of Extra Ordinary General Meeting was sent to each and every shareholder of the company so each and every shareholder was fully aware about allotment made to non-promoters and there was no intention to defraud with public shareholders and no promoter was benefitted from it.\\\\\\\\u201d 12. While the Noticees No. 11, 12 and 13 named above, adopted the aforementioned line of argument, the Noticees at serial nos. 1-9 reiterated the submission that their shareholdings too decreased due to the overall increase in the number of shares of the company due to preferential allotment of shares to non-promoter entities, but did not make any further sale of shares.   13.  The Noticees were provided an opportunity of personal hearing on March 17, 2021, through a notice of hearing sent to them vide email dated March 2, 2021. The said opportunity was availed by the Noticees No. 9, 11, 12 and 13. The other Noticees have not responded to the said notice of hearing, despite receipt of the Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 12 of 20  same through emails at the same email addresses from where they have been corresponding in the present proceedings. During the hearing held on March 17, 2021, the authorised representative of the Noticees No. 9, 11, 12 and 13 reiterated the contents of their earlier written submissions. I therefore, conclude that the principles of natural justice have been complied with qua the Noticees.  ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION 14.  The following issues now arise for consideration in the present case: a) Whether the Noticees have failed to disclose the change in their shareholding/ voting rights pursuant to the aforesaid preferential issue of shares, thereby violating Regulation 13(4A) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 read with Regulation 13(5) thereof? b) If the answer to the query raised above is in the affirmative, does that attract monetary penalty under section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act? c) If the answer to the queries raised above are in the affirmative, what should be the quantity of the penalty as per section 15J of the SEBI Act?  FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION 15.  Before, going into merits of the case, it is necessary to consider the case of the Noticee No. 10, i.e., Mr. Sushil Kumar Poddar. From the records made available, I find that the said Noticee cannot be identified as there are no contact details, address, PAN, DIN or any other indicator of his identity. Further, the change in the shareholding of the said Noticee from the quarter ended March 2013 to the quarter Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 13 of 20  ended June 2013 is also not available from the available records. The SCN could not be delivered to the said Noticee nor could any subsequent correspondences be delivered to him. I find that efforts have been made to ascertain his identity from the depositories as well as from the Registrar and Share Transfer Agent, but that too has not been able to establish his identity/ contact details. Efforts were also made to ascertain his identity from the other Noticees, but that too has not yielded any result. In view thereof, I cannot proceed against the Noticee No. 10, and the present proceedings are disposed of qua the said Noticee without any order.  16.  The core issue for consideration is, whether the reduction in the percentage of shareholding of the Noticees due to the preferential allotment of shares to the non-promoter entities, necessitated disclosure under regulation 13(4A) of the PIT Regulations, 1992. In this regard, the contents of Regulation 13(4A) is reproduced herein below: \\\\\\\\u201c13(4A) Any person who is a promoter or part of promoter group of a listed company, shall disclose to the company and the stock exchange where the securities are listed in Form D, the total number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights, if there has been a change in such holdings of such person from the last disclosure made under Listing Agreement or under sub-regulation (2A) or under this sub-regulation, and the change exceeds Rs. 5 lakh in value or 25,000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights, whichever is lower.]  (5) The disclosure mentioned in sub-regulations [(3), (4) and (4A)] shall be made within [two] working days of : Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 14 of 20   (a) the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares, or  (b) the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights, as the case may be.\\\\\\\\u201d [emphasis supplied] 17. It may be noted that, Regulation 13(4A) specifically mandates the promoters of a listed company to disclose to the company and the stock exchanges where the shares of the company are listed, if there has been a change in such holdings or the voting rights of such person from the last disclosure and the change exceeds Rupees 5 Lacs in value or 25,000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights, whichever is lower. Further, Regulation 13(5) mandates that the said disclosure should be made within 2 working days of the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares, or the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights.  18. From the fact of the case, I observe that pursuant to the preferential allotment of shares to the non-promoters in DTL, the percentage of shareholding of the Noticees in DTL had decreased by more than 1% during the period March 2013 to June 2013, resulting in an identical decrease in their voting rights. Hence, it triggered disclosure requirement by the Noticees under Regulation 13(4A) of PIT Regulations. Pursuant to the said decrease in the holdings, the Noticees were required to make the necessary disclosures to the company and the stock exchanges where the shares of DTL were listed, as prescribed under the PIT Regulations. However, it is an admitted fact that the Noticees did not make the said disclosures. Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 15 of 20  19. The Noticees in their reply have submitted that the decrease in their percentage of shareholding (i.e, their voting rights) happened due to the preferential allotment of shares to non-promoter entities and not due to any voluntary act on their part. In this regard, I am inclined to agree with Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 submission that the change in the percentage of the shareholding, i.e., voting rights, of the Noticees was brought about by the preferential allotment of shares to the non-promoter entities and was involuntary act. However, I find that there is no exemption available under the PIT Regulations from making the relevant disclosures under the applicable provisions of the said Regulations. I further note that, PIT Regulations does not distinguish between changes in shareholding whether it is due to voluntary or involuntary act and Regulation 13(4A) of PIT Regulations specifically mandates the promoters of a listed company to disclose their change in shareholding or voting rights. Further, in this regard I place reliance on Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT\\\\\\\\u2019s judgement dated October 14, 2014 in the matter of Virendrakumar Jayantilal Patel vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 299 of 2014), in which Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT observed that: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026. obligation to make disclosures within the stipulated time is a mandatory obligation and penalty is imposed for not complying with the mandatory obligation. Similarly, argument that the failure to make disclosures within the stipulated time, was unintentional, technical or inadvertent and that no gain or unfair advantage has accrued to the appellant, is also without any merit, because, all these factors are mitigating factors and these factors do not obliterate the obligation to make disclosures.\\\\\\\\u201d Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 16 of 20  20. Further, in support of their contentions of the non-applicability of the Regulation 13(4A) in respect of their decline in the voting rights, the Noticees in their reply have contended that the period of two working days for making the said disclosure under Regulation 13(4A) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulation is applicable only in case of allotment, acquisition or sale, therefore, the period of time as mentioned in Regulation 13(5) of the PIT Regulations is not applicable to the present case. In this regard, I note that the contention of the Noticees is patently erroneous in as much as the provisions of Regulation 13 provides for a continual disclosures of the shareholding or voting rights and if the shareholding/voting rights falls below a certain value/number of shares/percentage as provided in the said regulations then it is incumbent for the person to make the necessary disclosures. Thus, in the present case also, the Noticees were required to make the necessary disclosures in the stipulated time as specified in the said Regulation as it involved a change in the shareholding. Thus, the contention of the appellants cannot be accepted. 21. From the foregoing facts, I find that the Noticees were admittedly promoters of the company during the investigation period and the change in the percentage of their shareholding in DTL during the investigation period have already been tabulated in the preceding paragraphs in this order. Since, the aforementioned decrease in the percentage of shareholding during March 2013 to June 2013 triggered the threshold limit specified in the said Regulation, it required them to make the necessary disclosures as prescribed under the PIT Regulations, which they admittedly had failed to make either within the stipulated timeline or at all. Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 17 of 20  22. I further note that Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India, in the matter of Chairman, SEBI vs. Shriram Mutual Fund {[2006] 5 SCC 361} held that: \"In our view, the penalty is attracted as soon as contravention of the statutory obligations as contemplated by the Act is established and, therefore, the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes immaterial. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. Hence, we are of the view that once the contravention is established, then the penalty has to follow and only the quantum of penalty is discretionary\\\\\\\\u201d. 23. In view of the foregoing, I am convinced that the Noticees are thus liable for monetary penalty under Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act for violation of Regulations 13(4A) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992. The contents of Section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act, 1992 has already been reproduced at paragraph no. 9 in this order.  24. While determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, it is important to consider the factors relevantly as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under: -  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer.  Section 15J - While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely: -  (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default;  (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 18 of 20  (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  Explanation. \\\\\\\\u2014For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E, clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.  25. Having regard to the factors listed in section 15J and the guidelines issued by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in SEBI vs Bhavesh Pabari [Civil Appeal No(S).11311 of 2013] vide judgement dated February 28, 2019, it is noted that the provisions of section 15J has to be properly understood, and not to be mechanically applied and other factors reasonable for the facts of the case are also relevant to take into account for adjudging the quantum of penalty. In the instant, upon perusal of the documents available on record, I find that the factum of the prospective preferential allotment of shares to non-promoter entities which would lead to a significant decrease in the percentage of shareholding, i.e., voting rights of the promoter group, was known to the shareholders of DTL, since the notice of Extra Ordinary General Meeting held on February 28, 2013 (in which the special resolution for preferential allotment of 4800000 equity shares was passed) was sent to each and every shareholder of the company so each and every shareholder was fully aware about allotment made to non-promoters. Further, no perceptible gain or advantage has been accrued to the Noticees due to the aforesaid act of non- disclosure of their change in shareholding. However, I note that such change in the voting rights of the Noticees was never disclosed and had perhaps remained unknown to the investors at large. Adjudication Order in respect of thirteen promoter group entities in the matter of Dwitiya Trading Limited  Page 19 of 20   26. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and above factors and exercising the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby impose a monetary penalty of Rs. 12,00,000/- (Rupees Twelve Lakh only) on the Noticees No. 1-9, and 11-13 (to be paid jointly or severally) under Section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act, 1992. In my view, the said penalty is commensurate with the violation committed by the Noticees in this case.  27. The amount of penalty shall be paid either by way of demand draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, or by online payment through following path at SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in ENFORCEMENT \\\\\\\\u2192 Orders \\\\\\\\u2192 Orders of AO \\\\\\\\u2192 Click on PAY NOW or at linkhttps://siportal.sebi.gov.in/intermediary/AOPaymentGateway.html  28.

The LTP analysis of the order log and trade log was done of these five connected entities showed the following: Table 9 Sl. no Buyer Name No. of trades (LTP >0)  when buy order qty of 1 share only Positive LTP Contribution when buy order qty between 2-10 shares Positive LTP Contribution when buy order qty were more than 10 shares Total Positive LTP contribution (Rs.) % of positive LTP to Total Market positive LTP Positive LTP contribution No. of trades Positive LTP contribution No. of trades Positive LTP contribution No. of trades 1 Nimish Pankajkumar Shah 73 22.69 45 3.49 7 5.68 21 31.86 14.33 2 Mahesh Somabhai Desai 98 8.10 39 2.90 41 1.95 18 12.95 5.82 3 Soni Sanjay Jethalal 177 30.15 140 1.75 13 3.35 24 35.25 15.85 4 Soni Krupa Sanjay 53 3.15 23 0.10 1 3.10 29 6.35 2.86 5 Gagabhai Desai Amul 74 4.25 21 3.20 32 2.50 21 9.95 4.47 Total 475 68.34 268 11.44 94 16.58 113 96.36 43.33   v. It was observed that out of 475 buy trades of five Noticees contributing positive LTP of Rs 96.36, for 268 trades buy order quantity was 1 share, which contributed to positive LTP of Rs. 68.34 (30.73% of total market positive LTP). Further, for 94 trades, buy order quantity was in the range of 2-10 shares, which contributed positive LTP of Rs 11.44, i.e., 5.14% of total market positive LTP. Hence, it was observed that in the majority of the trades, all the five connected entities had put their buy orders with quantity of shares in single digits i.e. mostly from 1 to 10 shares whereas sell orders were available with quantity in the range of 1 to 50000 shares (Average of sell orders was 2500 shares).  vi. It was observed that these five connected entities contributed 35.47% of total market positive LTP, by putting orders for small quantity i.e. 1-10 shares.

Thus, from the trading pattern it has been alleged that these entities were not acting as genuine buyers and had no bona fide intention to buy because in-spite of sufficient sell order quantity being available in the market, they bought small quantity of shares in each transaction. By these trades, they were instrumental in establishing a price higher than the last traded price and, thus, contributed to such price rise in the scrip with most of their trades. In view of the repeated nature of such trades by these five connected entities, the culpability in increasing the price is established. Hence, it has been alleged that these five connected entities were acting in concert and contributed to manipulation in the scrip price and created a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip by such trades.  m. During the aforesaid price rise period i.e. 01/04/2014 to 24/07/2014, the price of the scrip at NSE opened at Rs 11.70 (previous trading day closed at 11.30), touched a high of Rs 19.55 and closed at Rs 12.70.

As can be noted from the SCN, the aforesaid SCN came to be issued against the Noticees in view of the fact that SEBI conducted an investigation into the Global Depository Receipts (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cGDR\\\\\\\\u201d) issues of Noticee no. 1 for the                     Final Order in the matter of Birla Power Solutions Limited  Page 3 of 60  period January 01, 2010 to February 28, 2010 and June 01, 2010 to July 31, 2010 (hereinafter also referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018investigation period\\\\\\\\u2019) to ascertain whether shares underlying GDRs were issued with proper consideration and whether appropriate disclosures, if any, were made by Noticee no. 1. The details of the said GDR issues are tabulated as below:   GDR issue date No. of GDRs  issued (mn.) Capital raised (USD mn.) Local custodian No. of equity shares underlying GDRs Global Depository Bank Lead Manager Bank where GDR proceeds deposited GDRs listed on 27 Jan, 2010 5.85 (at USD 3.42 per GDR) 20.01 HSBC Mumbai  29,25,00,000 The Bank of New York Mellon Pan Asia Advisors Limited EURAM BANK Bank, Austria Luxembourg Stock Exchange 09 July, 2010 21.24 (at USD 2.52 per GDR 53.53 1,06,21,92,350  3. BPSL (Noticee No. 1) issued GDRs in two tranches in the year 2010. In tranche \\\\\\\\u2013 1, 5,850,000 GDRs (USD 20.01 million, approximately Rs. 92.63 crore at RBI exchange rate of Rs. 46.29 per USD on January 27, 2010) were issued on January 27, 2010 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cGDR ONE\\\\\\\\u201d) and, in tranche \\\\\\\\u2013 2, 21,243,847 GDRs (USD 53.53 million, approximately Rs. 250.27 crore at RBI exchange rate of Rs. 46.75 per USD on July 09, 2010) were issued on July 09, 2010 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cGDR TWO\\\\\\\\u201d). It was observed from the corporate announcements made by the Company on BSE and NSE that no corporate announcement was made by the Company with respect to issuance of GDRs on January 27, 2010 (GDR ONE). However, it was noted that in the Annual Report of the Company for FY 2009-10, it was stated that the Company has issued 5,850,000 GDRs on January 27, 2010 (GDR ONE).  In respect of GDR issued on July 09, 2010 (GDR TWO), it was noted that the Company in its corporate announcement made on July 09, 2010 at BSE has mentioned about the issuance and allotment of GDR under GDR TWO.  4. Investigation revealed that the GDRs of the Company were subscribed by only one entity Vintage FZE (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cVintage\\\\\\\\u201d), now known as Alta Vista International FZE. Vintage opened two loan accounts (a/c no. 540012-025-4 and 540012-040-8) with EURAM Bank, a bank based in Vienna, Austria and obtained loans of USD 20.01 million and USD 53.53 million by entering into two Loan Agreements dated December 21, 2009 (Annexure \\\\\\\\u2013 5 to the SCN) and July 05, 2010 (Annexure \\\\\\\\u2013 6 to the SCN), respectively,                     Final Order in the matter of Birla Power Solutions Limited  Page 4 of 60  with EURAM Bank. The Company had provided security for the loan obtained by Vintage from EURAM Bank by pledging the GDR proceeds, through pledge agreements dated December 21, 2009 and July 05, 2010 with the EURAM Bank.    5. The SCN contained inter alia the following allegations:   a) BPSL issued 5.85 million GDRs (amounting to USD 20.01 million) on January 27, 2010 (GDR ONE) and 21.24 million GDRs (amounting to USD 53.53 million) on July 09, 2010 (GDR TWO). Vintage was the only entity to have subscribed to GDR ONE and GDR TWO and the subscription amount for both GDR ONE and GDR TWO was paid by Vintage by obtaining loans, i.e. through loan agreements dated December 21, 2009 for GDR ONE and dated July 05, 2010 for GDR TWO, from EURAM Bank.   b) Loan Agreement for issue of GDR ONE states that \\\\\\\\u201cNature and purpose of facility\\\\\\\\u201d is \\\\\\\\u201cTo provide funding enabling Vintage FZE to take down GDR issue of 5,850,000 Luxembourg public offering and may only be transferred to Euram account nr. 580010, Birla Power Solutions Ltd.\\\\\\\\u201d It was observed that this account was the same account where BPSL deposited its GDR proceeds for issue of GDR ONE. Similarly, the Loan Agreement for issue of GDR TWO states that \\\\\\\\u201cNature and purpose of facility\\\\\\\\u201d is \\\\\\\\u201cTo provide funding enabling Vintage FZE to take down GDR issue of 21,243,847 Luxembourg public offering and may only be transferred to Euram account nr. 580010, Birla Power Solutions Ltd.\\\\\\\\u201d It was observed that this account was the same account where BPSL deposited its proceeds for issue of GDR TWO.   c) It was further observed that with regard to securities for the loan, both Loan Agreements reads as under:    \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026.it is hereby irrevocably agreed that the following securities and any other securities which may be required by the Bank from time to time shall be given to the Bank as provided herein or in any other form or manner as may be demanded by the Bank:  1) Pledge of certain securities held from time to time in the Borrower\\\\\\\\u2019s a/c no. 540012 at the Bank as set out in a separate pledge agreement which is attached hereto as Annex 2 and which forms an integral part of this Loan Agreement.                     Final Order in the matter of Birla Power Solutions Limited  Page 5 of 60   2) Pledge of the account no. 580010 held with the Bank as set out in a separate pledge agreement which is attached hereto as Annex 2 and which forms an integral part of this Loan Agreement.\\\\\\\\u201d  d) On perusal of Vintage\\\\\\\\u2019s loan account statements (provided as Annexure \\\\\\\\u2013 7 to the SCN), it was observed that loan amount was increased to the extent of USD 0.30 million on January 31, 2011. Hence, total USD 53.83 million were availed by Vintage as loan for subscription of BPSL\\\\\\\\u2019s issue of GDR TWO. However, it was observed that although Vintage availed loan of USD 53.83 million for subscribing to the GDR TWO, there was no corresponding credit for the additional USD 0.30 million in the retail account statement of BPSL as subscription amount. From the examination of the above Loan Agreements, it was observed that Vintage had availed loan facility to the extent of USD 20.01 million and USD 53.83 million from EURAM Bank to subscribe to GDRs of BPSL.  e) It was noted that two Pledge Agreements dated December 21, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201c1st Pledge Agreement\\\\\\\\u201d) and July 05, 2010 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201c2nd Pledge Agreement\\\\\\\\u201d) for issue of GDR ONE and GDR TWO, respectively, were entered into between BPSL (as Pledgor) and EURAM Bank (as Bank). The Pledge Agreement for issue of GDR ONE was signed by Mr. P.V.R. Murthy (Director of BPSL) (Noticee No. 2) and Mr. N. Nagesh (Company Secretary of BPSL) (Noticee No. 3) whereas, the Pledge Agreement for issue of GDR TWO was signed by Mr. N. Nagesh (Company Secretary of BPSL) (Noticee No. 3). The pledge agreements dated December 21, 2009 and July 05, 2010 inter-alia states the following:  The preamble of the 1st Pledge Agreement states:  \\\\\\\\u201cBy loan agreement K211209-004 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cLoan Agreement\\\\\\\\u201d) dated 21 December 2009, the Bank granted a loan (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cLoan\\\\\\\\u201d) to Vintage FZE, AAH-213, Al Ahamadi House, Jebel Ali Free Trade Zone, Jebel Ali, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (the \\\\\\\\u201cBorrower\\\\\\\\u201d) in the amount of USD 20,007,000.

Pledge 2.1 In order to secure any and all obligations, present and future, whether conditional or unconditional of the Borrower towards the Bank under the Loan Agreement and any and all respective amendments thereto and for any and all other current or future claims which the Bank may have against the Borrower in connection with the Loan Agreement- including those limited as to condition or time or not yet due-irrespective of whether such claims have originated from the account relationship, from bill of exchange, guarantees and liabilities assumed by the Borrower or by the Bank, or have otherwise resulted from business relations, or have been assigned in connection therewith to the Bank (\\\\\\\\u201cthe Obligations\\\\\\\\u201d) the Pledgor hereby pledges to the Bank the following assets as collateral to the Bank:  2.1.1 all of its rights, title and interest in and to the securities deposited from time to time at present or hereafter (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPledged Securities\\\\\\\\u201d) and the balance of funds up to                     Final Order in the matter of Birla Power Solutions Limited  Page 7 of 60  the amount of USD 53,534,494.44 existing from time to time at present or hereafter on the securities account(s) no. 580010 held with the Bank (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPledged Securities Account\\\\\\\\u201d) and all amounts credited at any particular time therein. 2.1.2 all of its right, title and interest in and to, and the balance of funds existing from time to time at present or hereafter on the account(s) no. 580010 kept by the Bank (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPledged Time Deposit Account\\\\\\\\u201d) and all amounts credited at any particular time therein. The interest rate on deposit in the amount of the facility amount of the Loan Agreement will be fixed at 1.00% p.a. (The pledged Securities Account and the Pledged Time Deposit Account hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPledged Accounts\\\\\\\\u201d, the Pledged Securities and the Pledged Accounts hereinafter collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cCollateral\\\\\\\\u201d) 2.2 The Pledgor agrees to deposit with the Bank all dividends, interest and other payments, distributions of cash or other property resulting from the Pledged Securities and funds. 2.3 The Bank herewith accepts the pledges established pursuant to section 2.1 hereof.\\\\\\\\u201d  It was further observed that, following conditions were put in both the Pledge Agreements for realization of the pledge:   \\\\\\\\u201c6. Realisation of the Pledge 6.1 In the case that the Borrower fails to make payment on any due amount, or defaults in accordance with the Loan Agreement, the Pledgor herewith grants its express consent and the Bank is entitled to apply the funds in the Pledged Accounts to settle the Obligations. In such case the Bank shall transfer the funds on the Pledged Accounts, even repeatedly, to an account specified by the Bank. 6.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case that the Borrower fails to make payment on any due amount, or defaults in providing or increasing security, the Pledgor herewith grants its express consent and the Bank is entitled to realize the Pledged Securities (i) at a public auction for those items of Pledged Securities for which no market price is quoted or which are not listed on a recognized stock exchange or (ii) in a private sale pursuant to the provisions of Section 376 Austrian Commercial Code unless the Bank decides to exercise its rights through court proceedings. The Pledgor and the Bank agree to realize those items of the Pledged Securities for which a market price is quoted or which are listed on a stock exchange through sale by a broker publicly authorized for such transaction, selected by the Bank. 6.3 The Bank may realize the pledge rather than accepting payments from the Borrower after maturity of the claim if the Bank has reason to believe that the Borrower\\\\\\\\u2019s payments may be contestable.\\\\\\\\u201d  f) The pledge agreements dated December 21, 2009 and July 05, 2010 were an integral part of loan agreement dated December 21, 2009 for GDR ONE and loan agreement dated July 05, 2010 for GDR TWO entered into between Vintage and EURAM Bank. These agreements enabled Vintage to avail loan from EURAM Bank for subscribing GDR ONE and GDR TWO of Noticee no. 1. However, the fraudulent arrangement of loan agreements and pledge agreements which resulted in subscription of GDR issue of the Company was not disclosed to the stock exchange                     Final Order in the matter of Birla Power Solutions Limited  Page 8 of 60  in India.  g) The GDR issue would not have been subscribed had the Company not given any such security towards the loans taken by the Vintage.  h) From perusal of corporate announcements made by BPSL to the stock exchanges in India, it was found that BPSL had not informed with regard to pledge agreement entered into with EURAM Bank for subscription of GDRs and the outcomes of the board meeting dated October 29, 2009 which was price sensitive information and could have impacted the price of the scrip.  i) From the extracts of minutes of board meeting held on October 29, 2009, investigation observed that Mr. P.V.R. Murthy (Noticee No. 2) and Mr. N. Nagesh (Noticee No. 3) were authorized to sign the pledge agreement which acted as security in connection with the loan availed by Vintage from EURAM Bank, to use funds deposited in BPSL\\\\\\\\u2019s bank account as security in connection with the loan availed by Vintage. Relevant extracts of the resolution passed in the aforesaid meeting of the Board of BPSL are as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cRESOLVED THAT a bank account be opened with Euram Bank (\\\\\\\\u201cthe Bank\\\\\\\\u201d) or any branch of Euram Bank, including the Offshore Branch, outside India for the purpose of receiving subscription money in respect of the Global Depository Receipt issue of the Company.\\\\\\\\u201d  Resolution also states that:  \\\\\\\\u201cRESOLVED FURTHER THAT the following executives be and are hereby jointly and severally authorized to sign, execute, any application, agreement, escrow agreement, document, undertaking, confirmation, declaration and other paper(s) from time to time as may be required by the Bank and to carry and affix, Common Seal of the Company thereon, if and when so required.  1. Mr. P.V.R. Murthy 2. Mr. N. Nagesh   Resolution further states that:  RESOLVED FURTHER THAT the above named executives are jointly and severally authorize to draw cheques and other documents, and to give instructions from time to tome as may be necessary to the said Euram Bank or any of branch of Euram Bank, including the Offshore Branch, for the purpose of operation of and dealing with the said bank account and carry out other relevant and necessary transactions and generally to take all such steps and to do all such things as may be required from time to time on behalf of the Company.  Resolution further states that:                     Final Order in the matter of Birla Power Solutions Limited  Page 9 of 60  \\\\\\\\u201cRESOLVED FURTHER THAT the Bank be and is hereby authorized to use the funds so deposited in the aforesaid bank account as security in connection with loans if any as well as to enter into any Escrow Agreement or similar arrangements if and when so required.\\\\\\\\u201d  j) It was observed from the examination of the corporate announcements made by BPSL on BSE and NSE that no corporate announcement was made by BPSL with respect to issuance of GDRs on January 27, 2010 (GDR ONE). However, it was noted that in the Annual Report for FY 2009-10, it was stated that the Company has issued 5,850,000 GDRs on January 27, 2010 (GDR ONE). In respect of GDR issued on July 09, 2010 (GDR TWO), it was noted BPSL (Noticee No. 1) in its corporate announcement made on July 09, 2010 at BSE has mentioned about the issuance and allotment of GDR TWO. However, it did not inform stock exchange about the pledge agreement entered into with EURAM Bank. Information regarding signing of pledge Agreement is material information of contingent liability to the extent of GDR issues. Suppression of such material information shows that the corporate announcement was primarily meant to mislead Indian retail investors that GDRs were fully subscribed, whereas the GDR issue was indirectly funded by the Company itself.   k) The corporate announcement made by the Company to BSE reported misleading news which contained information in a distorted manner and might have influenced decision of investors.  l) Directors of BPSL, namely, Mr. P.V.R Murthy (Noticee No. 2), Mr. Rajesh V. Shah (Noticee No. 4), Mr. Upkar Singh Kohli (Noticee No. 5) and Chairman of BPSL Mr. Yashovardhan Birla (Noticee No. 6) who attended the board meeting dated October 29, 2009 and authorized Mr. P.V.R Murthy (Noticee No. 2) and Mr. N. Nagesh (Company Secretary) to sign documents with EURAM Bank, were alleged to have acted as party to the fraudulent scheme.    INSPECTION, REPLY, HEARING AND WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS:  6.

The matter was again placed before me on June 09, 2020 for hearing in the matter and                     Final Order in the matter of Birla Power Solutions Limited  Page 11 of 60  accordingly, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticees no. 5 and 6 on August 21, 2020 through inter alia video conferencing. Noticee no. 6 vide email dated August 18, 2020 sought adjournment of the hearing scheduled for August 21, 2020 citing reasons of difficulty due to the lockdown in Mumbai. The notice of hearing for August 21, 2020 was delivered to Noticee no. 5, however, the Noticee no. 5 did not appear for the hearing on August 21, 2020. Following the principles of natural justice and given the situation due to the lockdown, another opportunity for personal hearing was granted to Noticees no. 5 and 6 on October 12, 2020. On October 12, 2020, advocates on behalf of Noticee no. 5 appeared via video conferencing and made submissions. Subsequently, Noticee no. 5 filed its reply to the SCN vide letter dated October 20, 2020. Advocate for Noticee no. 6 appeared on October 12, 2020 and requested for copies of the Annexures to the SCN and for another date of personal hearing.

As sought by Noticee no. 6, SEBI vide emails dated October 31, 2020 provided copies of the Annexure to the SCN to Noticee no. 6. On November 09, 2020, the advocates for Noticee no. 6 appeared via videoconferencing and made submissions. Further, Noticee no. 6 submitted its reply to the SCN vide letter dated November 07, 2020. Thereafter, on March 11, 2021, Noticee no. 6 has filed his written submissions in the matter.    8. The various submissions made by the Noticees vide their aforesaid replies filed during the course of the hearing and in the written submissions filed, are summarised as hereunder:  a) Noticee No. 4 (Rajesh V. Shah) has in his replies dated January 18, 2019, February 05, 2019 and March 22, 2019 has inter alia submitted as under:   (i) The Noticee was admittedly an Independent non-executive director of BPSL. He was appointed as an independent director on December 16, 2005 and he resigned as a Director with effect from July 8, 2013. The status of the Noticee as an independent director is also accepted in the SCN at Annexure-9, page 31 wherein details of the directors of BPSL are set out. (ii) During his tenure as an independent director the company was managed by full time professionals under the Promoter, Mr. Yashovardhan Birla, who was permanent Chairman who alongwith other Executive Directors and Management                     Final Order in the matter of Birla Power Solutions Limited  Page 12 of 60  Professionals looked after the day to day operations of BPSL. (iii) As an independent director, the Noticee did not have any role in the day to day operations and management of BPSL. The Noticee merely attended the meeting of the Board of Directors of BPSL and considered issues which were placed before the Board of Directors. All decisions which were taken during these meetings were decisions of the Board and not individually of the Noticee. All day to day operations and managerial tasks including operations of bank accounts, utilization of funds raised by the company and other activities were handled by CEO/WTD, CFO, Company secretary, General Manager, promoter and the Company Management Team. As an independent director, the Noticee was never involved in these activities and was not responsible for the same. The Noticees role was confined to providing an opinion on issues brought for discussions before the Board of Directors of BPSL. Thus, the Noticee did not have any means of ascertaining any information in respect of the company unless the same was placed before the Board of Directors at a duly convened meetings of the Board of Directors. (iv) Furthermore, the Noticee had no reason at any point of time to seek any further information or documents from BPSL other than that placed before the Board at the meeting as during the period when the Noticee was an Independent Director of BPSL there was no apprehension of any wrong doing of BPSL. At every Board meeting, the Noticee insisted on compliance certificate of the CEO as well as of the Company Secretary assuring that all laws are complied with and assurances were obtained from the management about the various compliances. As an independent director, the Noticee is not expected to doubt or verify whether the statements of CEO, WTD or Chairman or secretary is correct or not. (v) Prior to dealing with the allegation made against the Noticee in the SCN, the Noticee repeats and reiterates that inspection of all the documents sought for by the Noticee including all the minutes of the board meeting/investigation report have not been furnished/given to the Noticee. Furthermore, only extracts of certain documents have been provided to the Noticee, which extracts are not sufficient. Illustratively, extracts of the Annual report have been sought to be relied upon by SEBI vis-\\\\\\\\xe0-vis the complete Annual report which contains material                     Final Order in the matter of Birla Power Solutions Limited  Page 13 of 60  that would support the Noticee as is more particularly articulated hereinafter. (vi) The Noticee believes that if inspection and complete copies of the relevant documents are provided to the Noticee, then not only would the Noticee be exonerated of the allegations in the SCN, the same would also demonstrate that the SCN has been selectively issued, that the actual persons involved in taking the impugned action/decisions set out in the SCN have been excluded for unknown reasons and an independent director has been unfortunately targeted/been discriminated against. In this regard, the judgement of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in SEBI vs. Price Waterhouse & Co. and Ors dated January 10, 2017 passed in civil appeal no. 6003-6004 of 2012 is extremely relevant. In the aforesaid case, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court inter alia directed SEBI to provide copies of all statements collected during the course of the investigation to the Respondents with inspection of all documents collected during inspection and only thereupon would it be permissible to reply upon the same. The judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in HB Stockholdings Ltd vs. SEBI decision dated August 27, 2013 reported in Manu/SB/0039/2013 has also been relied upon. (vii) It is submitted that the present SCN was issued to the Noticee on May 25, 2018 in respect of a meeting of a Board of directors attended almost a decade prior viz October 29, 2009. The aforesaid clearly demonstrates the gross delay by SEBI in the present proceedings. The aforesaid delay is unconscionable and itself defeats the interest of justice. The delay in issuance of the SCN causes significant prejudice to the Noticee as he is deprived of contemporaneous records which would have been available had the SCN been issued promptly or at least within a reasonable time and certainly not after a prolonged delay of 9 years. The judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in HB Stockholdings Ltd vs. SEBI decision dated August 27, 2013 reported in Manu/SB/0039/2013 has also been relied upon. (viii) It further appears that SEBI has also attempted to selectively target the Noticee as a director who was present at the meeting wi", "Date": "2021-03-23", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Final Order in the matter of Birla Power Solutions Limited dated March 23, 2021[SAT Appeal No.:433/2021][SAT Appeal No.:435/2021]", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/mar-2021/final-order-in-the-matter-of-birla-power-solutions-limited-dated-march-23-2021_49621.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 61060, "unique_record_id": "4bc03964a1SEBI20210323", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6681805c78589103064725e4", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 15:56:44", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "No financial penalties mentioned.", "gpt_audience": "- Investors in Birla Power Solutions Limited\n- Shareholders of Birla Power Solutions Limited\n- Regulatory authorities such as SEBI\n- Financial analysts and advisors\n- Legal professionals and compliance officers\n- Company management and board members\n- Financial journalists and media outlets\n- Auditors and accounting firms\n- Potential investors and market participants\n- Academic researchers in finance and corporate governance", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

Of the 9 group entities, Noticee nos. 1 to 5, Vision and Moebius traded in the NSE cash market during the investigation period. Noticee no. 6 traded in the NSE cash market on September 27, 2012 before 15:00 hrs. 2.11. Of the 9 group entities, 7 entities (i.e. the Noticees) were holding long positions in the scrip of Ruchi Soya futures expiring on September 27, 2012.  2.12. 7 of the group entities (Noticee nos. 1 to 5, Vision and Moebius) were net buyers in the NSE cash market on September 27, 2012.

The trades amongst the group entities contributed 14.61% of the total buy volume of the group  Final Order in the matter of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.    Page 5 of 59    entities and 98.72% of the total sell volume of the group entities during the investigation period. 2.14. The buy trades of the 7 group entities (Noticee nos. 1 to 5, Vision and Moebius) were concentrated in the last 30 minutes (especially last 3 minutes) of trading on September 27, 2012. It was observed that the buy volume of these group entities contributed 61.63% and 79.69% to the market traded volume in the last 30 minutes and last 3 minutes of trading on September 27, 2012, respectively. 2.15. These group entities contributed Rs. 62.95 to positive LTP and Rs. 7.4 to negative LTP. It was observed that the group entities contributed 18.31% to the market positive LTP. 2.16. It was observed that the buy trades of the 4 group entities namely \\\\\\\\u2013 Noticee nos. 1, 4, 5 and Moebius contributed to market positive LTP and also had positive net LTP contribution. Therefore, the buy trades of these 4 entities were analysed further.  - It was observed that Noticee no. 1 modified the bid price of orders to Rs. 88 when the LTP was Rs. 72.1/73.5 and the required quantity was available at lesser price itself. Thus, Noticee no. 1 had deliberately placed order at prices higher than LTP to increase the price of the scrip and contributed to the price rise of Ruchi Soya in a fraudulent manner. - It was observed that Noticee no. 4 modified the bid price of orders to Rs. 88 when the LTP was Rs. 84.8 - 86 and the required quantity was available at lesser price itself. These trades of Noticee no. 4 contributed to positive LTP and Net LTP of the scrip and contributed to the price rise of the scrip in a fraudulent manner. - It was observed that Noticee no. 5 modified the bid price of orders at to Rs. 88 when the LTP was Rs. 85 \\\\\\\\u2013 85.5 and the required quantity was available at lesser price itself. These trades of Noticee no. 5 contributed to positive LTP and Net LTP of the scrip and contributed to the price rise of the scrip in a fraudulent manner. - It was observed that Moebius modified the bid price of orders to Rs. 88 when the LTP was Rs. 76.5 - 82 and the required quantity was available  Final Order in the matter of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.    Page 6 of 59    at lesser price itself. These trades of Moebius contributed to positive LTP and Net LTP of the scrip. Thus, Moebius contributed to the price rise of the scrip in a fraudulent manner. 2.17. It was observed that 3 of the group entities, i.e. Noticee no. 2, 3 and Vision placed sell orders of 15 lakhs each at 14:42:11, 14:41:50 and 14:48:10, respectively, with a limit price of Rs. 88 significantly higher than the LTP of Rs. 71. The sell order quantity was modified to 7 lakh shares at 15:28:05 hrs, 15:27:55 hrs and 15:27:43 hrs. When the Noticee nos. 1, 4, 5 and Moebius placed buy orders for the same price i.e. Rs. 88 beginning 15:28:05, the orders matched and the trades were executed. Thus, the group entities together established a higher trading price of Rs. 88 in the market by placing matching buy and sell orders. Thus, it is evident that the entities Noticee nos. 1, 4, 5 and Moebius (buyers) in collusion with the Noticee nos. 2,3 and Vision (sellers) set higher market traded price. 2.18. 98.72% of the sell trades of the group entities were executed with the group entities themselves.  2.19. Noticee no. 1 to 5, Moebius and Vision traded heavily on September 27, 2012 mainly during 15:00 hrs. to 15:30 hrs. which is taken for consideration of the calculation of the settlement price of the futures contracts. These 7 group entities had engaged in price manipulation as described above, in the scrip of Ruchi Soya at NSE cash market during 15:00:00 hrs. to 15:30:00 hrs. on September 27, 2012. Through this manipulation, these 7 group entities had managed to artificially establish higher settlement price in the futures of Ruchi Soya on September 27, 2012, which finally closed at Rs. 78.65. 2.20. It was observed that 7 (Noticee nos. 1 to 7) of the 9 group entities were holding net long positions in the scrip as on September 27, 2012. 2.21. These 7 group entities holding long position in the Ruchi Soya futures (Noticee nos. 1 to 7) as on September 27, 2012, also appear in the top 10 entities holding long position in the Ruchi Soya futures as on September 27, 2012. Therefore, it would be in the interest of these 7 group entities if the price of the scrip rises in the cash market.  Final Order in the matter of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.    Page 7 of 59    2.22. The aforesaid scheme of \\\\\\\\u201cmarking the close\\\\\\\\u201d devised by the 7 group entities (Noticee no. 1 to 5, Moebius and Vision) enabled the 7 group entities (Noticee nos. 1 to7) who were holding long positions in the Ruchi Soya futures on September 27, 2012 to reduce their losses arising out of their long positions. 2.23. If Noticee no. 1 to 5, Moebius and Vision had not manipulated the settlement price, Noticee nos. 1 to 7 would have made square-off losses of Rs. 11.48 crores. Due to the manipulation, Noticee nos. 1 to 7 have reduced their square-off losses to Rs. 5.72 crores. As observed above, Betul Oils and Betul Minerals acting together with other 5 group entities benefitted from this manipulation by reducing their square-off losses in the futures segment. 2.24. Therefore, Noticee nos. 1 to 7 have reduced their losses by Rs. 5.76 crores through the manipulative trades of their connected entities- Noticee no. 1 to 5, Moebius and Vision. 2.25. The closing price of the Ruchi Soya scrip as on September 28, 2012 (next trading day of the investigation period) was Rs. 74.55. It was observed that Noticee no. 1 to 5, Moebius and Vision traded in the Ruchi Soya cash market during the investigation period. The notional loss of these 7 group entities for their cash positions acquired during the investigation period on September 27, 2012 at Rs. 74.55 is given as under:                              Notional loss to the 7 Group Entities                            Value in lakhs S.No. Entity Name Buy Qty Buy Val (in Rs) Sell Qty Sell Val (in Rs) Net Buy Qty Net Buy Val (in Rs) Val at closing price of Rs. 74.55 Profit / Loss made in cash position(in Rs)   A B C D E=A-C F=B-D G=E*74.55 H=G-F 1 Aventis 29 2438.13 0 0 29 2438.13 2161.95 -276.18 2 Moebius 20 1668.04 0 0 20 1668.04 1491.00 -177.04 3 Navinya 11.3 808.66 4.2 369.6 7.1 439.06 529.54 90.48 4 Sunmate 7 610.67 0 0 7 610.67 521.85 -88.82 5 Shreyans 6 522.90 0 0 6 522.90 447.30 -75.60 6 Uni24 4.5 323.76 3.7 325.77 0.8 -2.02 59.49 61.51 7 Vision* 3.99 285.18 4.2 369.6 -0.21 285.18    Total 81.79 6657.33 12.10 1064.97 69.69 5592.36 5211.13 -465.64  *Since Vision was a net seller in the market during the investigation period, its trades are excluded from the calculation of notional loss.  Final Order in the matter of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.    Page 8 of 59    2.26. From the table above, it is observed that these 7 group entities made notional loss of Rs. 4.66 crore by their cash position in the scrip of Ruchi Soya. Since, the avoidance of losses of the group entities in the futures market is Rs. 5.76 crores compared to the notional loss of Rs. 4.66 crores in the cash market, the group entities made a net gain of Rs. 1.1 crore through their manipulative trades. 2.27. In view of the foregoing, it is observed that 9 group entities were connected to each other. Of the 9 Group entities, 7 entities, namely, Aventis Biofeeds Private Limited (Noticee no. 1), Navinya Multitrade Private Limited (Noticee no. 2) , Uni24 Techno Solutions Private Limited (Noticee no. 3), Sunmate Trade Private Limited (Noticee no. 4), Shreyans Credit and Capital Private Limited (Noticee no. 5), Vision Millennium Exports Private Limited and Moebius Credit and Capital Private Limited, traded and contributed to price rise in the scrip of Ruchi Soya during last 30 minutes of trading at NSE on September 27, 2012. 2 entities, i.e. Betul Oils and Betul Minerals did not trade in the NSE cash market during 15:00:00 hrs. to 15:30:00 hrs. on September 27, 2012 but they were connected to the 7 other group entities who contributed to the price rise. In the futures market, 7 entities, namely, Aventis Biofeeds Private Limited (Noticee no. 1), Navinya Multitrade Private Limited (Noticee no. 2) , Uni24 Techno Solutions Private Limited (Noticee no. 3), Sunmate Trade Private Limited (Noticee no. 4), Shreyans Credit and Capital Private Limited (Noticee no. 5), Betul Oils and Feeds Private Limited (Noticee no. 6) and Betul Minerals and Constructions Private Limited (Noticee no. 7) were observed to be holding long positions in the scrip of Ruchi Soya futures expiring on September 27, 2012 and thus, benefitted from the price rise in the cash market in the manner discussed above. Vision and Moebius, did not hold any long position in the in the scrip of Ruchi Soya futures expiring on September 27, 2012 and thus, did not benefit in the form of avoidance of losses. Thus, 5 Noticees i.e Aventis Biofeeds Private Limited (Noticee no. 1), Navinya Multitrade Private Limited (Noticee no. 2), Uni24 Techno Solutions Private Limited (Noticee no. 3), Sunmate Trade Private Limited (Noticee no. 4), Shreyans Credit and  Final Order in the matter of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.    Page 9 of 59    Capital Private Limited (Noticee no. 5), are alleged to have violated alleged to have violated Section 12A (a), (b), (c) of SEBI Act, 1992, Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (e) the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. 2.28. Two group entities namely \\\\\\\\u2013 Betul Oils and Feeds Private Limited (Noticee no. 6) and Betul Minerals and Constructions Private Limited (Noticee no. 7) benefitted from the price rise contributed by other group entities by their holding in long positions in in the futures of Ruchi Soya. Thus, they are alleged to have violated Section 12A (a), (b), (c) of SEBI Act, 1992, Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003 2.29. It is also alleged that the group entities engaged in manipulative trades and the 7 Noticees who held long positions in futures of Ruchi Soya (for expiry on September 27, 2012) reduced their square-off losses. If the group entities had not manipulated the settlement price these 7 Noticees would have made square-off losses of Rs. 11.48 crore. Due to their manipulation, the have reduced their square-off losses of Rs. 5.72 crore. Therefore, the 7 group entities reduced their losses by Rs. 5.76 crore through manipulative trades which is their ill-gotten gains.  3. The following annexures were provided with the SCN: Annexures to SCN Annexure  Particulars  A Basis of connection between 9 Group entities B Details of top 10 clients in Ruchi Soya C Top 10 clients holding long position in Ruchi Soya futures on September 27, 2012  4. A reply dated December 07, 2017, was received from Noticee no. 1 and a reply dated December 12, 2017 was received from Noticee no.4 on similar lines, submitting as follows: 4.1. The Noticees denied the allegations in the SCN. The Noticees stated that they were in the business of investing and trading in the securities market.  4.2. In 2011-12 there were numerous research reports which had recommended buying the scrip of Ruchi Soya even at prices at over Rs.100/- per share and which had predicted that the price would rise to Rs.150 to Rs.175. The price  Final Order in the matter of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.    Page 10 of 59    volume data also indicated that the scrip had great potential. In February 2012 it had reached Rs.103.90. Since, January till July the price was constantly above Rs.88. 4.3. The Noticees had thus believed that the said scrip would rise in prices, and had therefore inter alia taken long positions in Futures contracts for the same. These futures were in fact rolled over by the Noticees from time to time so as to maintain the said long position, since it was convinced that the said scrip would perform well in the future. Noticee 1\\\\\\\\u2019s futures open positions acquisition costs for about 11 lac shares worked out to about Rs. 85.99 per share, and together with the roll over premium it costs of about 3.94 per share, the same came to about Rs. 89.93 per share. Since the Noticees had expected the scrip to rise to well over Rs. 100/-  per share, it continued holding the said open positions.  4.4. The National Stock Exchange (\"NSE\") announced that the said scrip would be removed from the derivatives segment with effect from 27.9.2012. Thus, the NSE decided to stop F&O trading in the said scrip with effect from the close of 27.9.2012, which was the date when the said futures contracts would be expiring. 4.5. The  price and volume movement in the scrip has to be appreciated  in context of the  fact  that    September  27, 2012 was the  expiry  day of  all derivative contracts the scrip .In so far as price movement during the last half hour of the trading day, it may be appreciated that the weighted average traded price of the last 30 minutes in the Cash segment decides the closing/settlement price for the Futures segment and therefore  if the purchase is made in the last 30 minutes there is much higher likelihood  of the average purchase price and the closing price to be close to each other. 4.6. Admittedly, in the past, the scrip had touched an all-time high of Rs.165.25. Therefore, the rising of price to Rs.88 on September 27, 2012 was perfectly in consonance with the price movement in the scrip in the past. There was nothing abnormal and unusual in the same. Thus there was nothing abnormal or unusual in the volumes in the market on the last expiry day i.e. September 27,2012.  Final Order in the matter of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.    Page 11 of 59    4.7. It is vehemently denied that the Noticees are connected to other entities as alleged. The Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 trades have been erroneously lumped with the other entities in order to draw adverse inferences against us. The whole grouping is flawed. At the relevant time it had independently traded in the scrip without acting  in  concert  with  other  entities. 4.8. Based on the KYCs, extracts from MCA website, bank account statements of various entities no adverse inference can be drawn against the Noticees. The alleged basis of connection viz. Received funds from Vision, it is submitted that the receipt of funds by the Noticee no.1 from Vision was in the ordinary course and the same had nothing to do with its trading in the scrip. At the relevant time it was not aware as to whether Vision is trading in the scrip or not. Admittedly, as per the Notice, SEBI itself has held that Vision did not hold long positions in the Futures of Ruchi Soya expiring on September 27, 2012 and thus did not benefit in the form of avoidance of losses. Therefore, its interests were admittedly contrary to the alleged manipulation, and any increase in the settlement price would result in losses to them. The alleged basis of connection viz. \"Common phone number 9821994534\\\\\\\\u201d with Vision, Sunmate, Shreyans, Betul Oils and Betul Minerals\" is also totally misplaced. It is submitted that the said number does not belong to the Noitcee. It has not been spelled as to on what basis the common phone number is alleged. In fact, it is SEBI's own case that as per the Revocation Order that the said phone number actually belongs to Betul Minerals.  4.9. On September 27, 2012 the Noticee no.1 had been placing buy orders since morning and were not in a position to buy the requisite quantity. Between 11:46:30 to 14:56:53 it was in a position to purchase only 3,72,224 shares. Remaining shares could be purchased only in the last two minutes, wherein the Noticee no.1 had to increase the price. Admittedly, it had bought 32,72,224 shares and also taken delivery of the same . Further, post  the said  purchases, it had held the shares for a considerable period. 4.10. At the relevant time it had traded without being aware of the counter party clients/brokers. Therefore, the observation of trades amongst the \\\\\\\\u201c7 group entities\" contributing 9% of the total traded volume during investigation period  Final Order in the matter of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.    Page 12 of 59    is totally misplaced. Admittedly, it is not the case that whole 29,00,000 shares bought by the Noticee no.1 during the 3 pm to 3.30 pm are with the alleged group entities. Out of total of 29,00,000 shares only 7,54,217 shares have been traded with the alleged group entities. Remaining 21,45,783 shares have been traded with other entities. It may be appreciated that the Noticee no. 1 had actually taken the delivery of shares and have paid around Rs. 27 crores for taking the position. Admittedly, in so far as 3,72,224 shares bought by it prior to 3 pm are concerned, there is no allegation of any trades being executed with the group entities. Thus, out of total of 32,72,224 shares bought by it on 27.9.12, allegation of trades with alleged group entities is limited to 7,54,217 shares only and bulk of the shares i.e. 25,18,007 have been purchased from unconnected parties at allegedly increased prices. 4.11. With   regard to the details of top 10 clients concentration   during the   investigation   period it is submitted   that   SEBI   has completely ignored the trading of various entities other than the alleged group entities. Further, no action has been taken against those entities. 4.12. It is not as if the Noticees entered into any square off trades, which are typically done for the purpose of increasing the volume or price. 4.13. Calculation of percentages is based on conveniently cherry picked time slots so as to   arrive at preconceived conclusions.  4.14. It is denied that the Noticees had traded heavily in the scrip on September 27, 2012 only during last half an hour as alleged. On the contrary, record will bear out that the Noticees were bonafide buying throughout the day. 4.15. The Noticee no.1 had actually held on to the shares for a considerable period and ultimately   sold off the same during FY 2015 at the average price of Rs. 39.47, thus incurring further losses of Rs. 44.60 per share as against the average purchase costs of Rs. 84.07 per share as aforesaid. 4.16. The Noticee no.1 had placed the buy orders at around 14:27:30 on September 27,2012 in order to convert its Futures position to Cash position. Subsequently, since the price did not fall, the said order placed at 14:27:30, remained pending in the system, at around 15:28:05 in the dying hours of the trading session the Noticee no.1 and 4 had modified the buy price to Rs 88/-.  Final Order in the matter of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.    Page 13 of 59    Had its intention been to rig the price the Noticees would have bought the shares in one shot in a single lot. Admittedly, it had modified the orders in a staggered fashion, wherein it had placed the orders in the tranche of 5 lacs shares to get the desired quantity while doing averaging so that our average purchase cost can come down. 4.17. It may be noted that it had placed first order at 15:28:05 for 4,00,000 shares at a price of  Rs.88/- which got traded  at  a price of  Rs. 74.82/-. Thereafter it placed another order at 15:28:17 for 5,00,000 shares at Rs.88/- which got traded at price of 76.72. Thereafter it placed the third order at 15:28:42 for 5,00,000 shares at Rs.88/- which got traded at price of 87.83. Thereafter it placed another order at 15:28:45 for 5,00,000 shares at Rs.88/- which got traded at price of 87.35. Thereafter it placed another order at 15:28:48 for 5,00,000 shares at Rs.88/-which got traded at price of 87.92. Thereafter it placed the last order at 15:28:51for 5,00,000 shares at Rs.88/- which got traded at price of 87.94. From the aforesaid trading pattern it is clear that our intent was to genuinely buy the shares from the market. 4.18. It may be noted at the relevant time, as per the data available on screen, the price was hovering around Rs.72/- and there were not many sellers. Since the Noticees were keen on holding their position and rollover in Futures was not possible as the scrip was getting removed from the derivatives segment it had no option but to buy the shares and to quote a price so as to attract the sellers to sell the required quantum of shares. 4.19. Here it may be appreciated that at the relevant time there were no requisite sell orders for the required quantum.  4.20. In context of allegation of price rise, it may be appreciated that at any given point of time only best five buy/sell orders are only visible on the screen. At the relevant time there were no way for anybody to know that   what are the sell orders in the system and for what all prices. The purported analysis of the Order book, in the Notice, has been done with the benefit of hindsight, completely ignoring and overlooking the reality of trading systems.  Final Order in the matter of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.    Page 14 of 59    4.21. Fact that it   did   not place one order, but   modified the orders in staggered manner also reinforces the stand that it did not   hike up the price. Had it not been so nothing prevented it to place one single order for 29 lac shares.   4.22. Based on the data as has been set out in the SCN it is clear that during the impugned period the Sellers had placed their bids between the range of Rs 72 to Rs 96/-. Same clearly indicates that our buying of shares at Rs 88/- was neither unusual or abnormal. In fact, the sellers were expecting around Rs 96/- and had placed their bids accordingly. 4.23. While making allegations about placement of orders above LTP and creation of new high prices, it has been completely ignored and overlooked that placing orders at higher prices than LTP is a completely normal practice when a party is particular about wanting execution of full quantity of a buy order. 4.24. It may be appreciated that the Noticee no.1 had placed buy orders at lower prices since the morning, but it only got 3,72,224 shares at a lower price, at about Rs. 71/-.  4.25. lf the intention was to rig/manipulate the settlement price so as to benefit in the futures contract close out as alleged, then the trading at the higher prices would obviously had been done during the entire last half hour of the cash market trading and not just during the last two minutes 4.26. The allegations of manipulation are belied by the facts on record, since admittedly the cash market purchases were at prices as high as Rs. 88/- whereas the settlement price was Rs.78.65, resulting in substantial losses to the Noticee nos. 1 and 4, which were even greater than the losses would have been if no shares had been purchased in the cash market.  In fact, as aforesaid, even after the said Revocation Order dated 6.12.2013, the Noticee no.1 continued to hold the said shares and ultimately sold off the same during FY 2015 at the average price of Rs. 39.47, thus incurring further losses of Rs. 44.60 per share as against the average purchase costs of  Rs. 84.07 per share as aforesaid. 4.27. It has been ignored as to what was to be gained by the Noticees by allegedly marking the close price, when it had taken delivery of the shares in the cash market and are still holding the same.  Final Order in the matter of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.    Page 15 of 59    4.28. Admittedly, there is no allegation that the orders were synchronized/premeditated, which is generally common in the case of price rigging.  4.29. Significantly, it is SEBI's own case that the alleged trades contributed 0.67% to the market   positive   LTP during   the   investigation   period   which   is exceedingly insignificant. 4.30. The entire calculation pertaining to impact of the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 trades on the closing price is wrong   and misleading. Even if it is assumed that there was some impact as a result of its trading (i.e. 7.54 lacs shares matching with others) the same would be Rs.0.56. 4.31. Without prejudice to the aforesaid, even it is assumed that   the   alleged group entities were trading together and their trading had an impact then because of the trading between the group entities the impact would be to the extent of Rs 0.93/- only and not Rs 8/- as alleged. 4.32. From the aforesaid table it is evident that the alleged difference in Square - off gain qua the Noticees would be Rs 10.45 lakhs only and not Rs. 89.92 lakhs as alleged 4.33. The calculation of notional loss of group entities from their cash position based on closing price of Ruchi Soya scrip as on September 28, 2012 i.e.Rs. 74.55 is erroneous since", "Date": "2021-03-19", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Final Order in the matter of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/mar-2021/final-order-in-the-matter-of-ruchi-soya-industries-ltd-_49577.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 61002, "unique_record_id": "64a601a2adSEBI20210319", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "66817cb478589103064725a8", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 15:41:08", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "Rs. 5.76 crore", "gpt_audience": "- Investors in Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.\n- Shareholders of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.\n- Regulatory authorities such as SEBI\n- Financial analysts and market researchers\n- Legal professionals and compliance officers\n- Financial journalists and media outlets\n- Stock market participants and traders\n- Corporate governance experts\n- Auditors and financial advisors\n- Academic researchers in finance and securities law", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "No individuals are mentioned in the article.", "gpt_summary": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a final order against seven entities, including Aventis Biofeeds Private Limited and Navinya Multitrade Private Limited, for manipulating the price of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd. shares on September 27, 2012.

The terms and conditions of the Scheme, as mentioned in the Application Form (for investing in the scheme) are discussed in the following paragraphs.  (b) The Scheme envisaged investment from the applicant(s) invited the public to subscribe in unit of 5 Teak Trees or multiple thereof. The salient features of the scheme floated by all the three Companies were identical/common so far as the terms and conditions of investment are concerned, except for the minimum amount of consideration/investment required to be made and the respective maturity periods for the schemes launched by the aforesaid 3 Companies. (c)  The Scheme entailed a minimum investment of INR 7,500 and multiples thereof for each unit of 5 Teak Trees in PPPL and APPL; whereas in TCPL, a minimum investment of INR 5,000 and multiple thereof was required for a unit of 5 Teak Trees or multiple thereof. In return of the said investment, investors are issued a certificate entitling them the ownership of 5 Teak Trees or multiple thereof, in lieu of the investment so made in the Scheme.  (d) The above stated scheme so floated by the three Companies proposed for planting of selected premium grade CP Teak Saplings in the year 1992. The said saplings were to be Order in the matter of Prime Plantations Pvt. Ltd. and others  Page 5 of 27  nurtured by the Companies under supervision of Horticulturist appointed/nominated by the Companies. The projected yield of Teak Wood per tree was disclosed to be 25 to 35 Cubic Feet.  (e) The said Scheme started in the year 1992. The duration of the Scheme for PPPL was 14 years whereas for TCPL, the duration was 12 years and for APPL, the duration was 10 years. For all the three Companies the scheme commenced from the dates of receipt of application money in respect of the respective Companies.   (f) The Companies were supposed to inform the applicants/investors, three months before the maturity of the Scheme apprising that the trees are fully grown and ready for delivery.  (g) The investors at the maturity of the respective schemes may either opt for taking delivery of the duly cut Teak Trees or may opt for receiving realized sale proceeds in respect of those trees that they are entitiled to receive . The Teak Trees or the sale proceeds, as opted by investors, shall be delivered to investors within two months of the date of receipt/surrender of the Green Chip Certificate from the investor intimating therein his/her exercise of option.  (h) The Companies shall cut the Teak Tree, 30 cms above the ground level.  (i) If investor does not respond within a period of two months of the intimation given by the Companies, the Company will wait for the response of investor for a period of one year. In case the investor does not respond till completion of one year, the Companies shall cut the Teak Trees, sell such trees, and keep the sale proceeds to the credit of the investor for a period of further/additional two years. After such period of additional two years, the right of the investor on such sale proceeds shall cease to exist.  (j) The right to control and manage the saplings and the tree rests with the Companies.  (k) The Scheme will terminate with the Companies delivering Teak Tree or paying the sale proceeds to the investors.  3. Pursuant to the aforesaid examination conducted by SEBI, a show cause notice (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) dated November 28, 2019 was issued to the Noticees alleging inter alia as:  (a) The Scheme under the name of \\\\\\\\u2018Green Chip Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019 is a collective investment scheme in terms of the definition of collective investment scheme, laid down under Section 11 AA (2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act (hereinafter referred to as \"SEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d); Order in the matter of Prime Plantations Pvt. Ltd. and others  Page 6 of 27  (b) The Noticee nos. 1 to 3 have not obtained the certificate of registration from SEBI for the said Scheme, and have acted in violation of Section 12 (1B) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3 of the SEBI (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI CIS Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d).   (c) Under the said Scheme INR 11,57,500, INR 12,06,000 and INR 3,42,500 have been mobilised by PPPL; by ACPL and by TCPL respectively;  (d) As per the Auditor\\\\\\\\u2019s certificate filed by the three Companies, an amount of INR 2,12,500 is still due to be refunded by PPPL; INR 22,500 by ACPL and INR 1,45,000 by TCPL; and (e) Noticee nos. 4 to 13, being Directors of the Noticee nos. 1 to 3, are jointly and severally responsible for the conduct of the business of the Noticees nos.1 to 3, during the period of mobilization of funds under the aforesaid scheme and thus have also violated the provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 and SEBI CIS Regulations.  4. The SCN called upon the Noticees to show cause as to why the above referred Scheme of the Companies be not declared as a CIS and as to why appropriate directions including the directions to wind up the said Scheme and to refund the money collected under the Scheme, with returns which are due as per the terms of the offer, shall not be issued against the Noticees. It is noted that in response to the SCN, the Noticees, vide letter dated February 03, 2020, have filed a common reply to the SCN. The personal hearing in the matter was conducted on July 29, 2020 and certain queries were raised to the Noticees during the said personal hearing, in response to which, vide letter dated August 23, 2020 a post hearing written submission has been filed by the Noticees. The key submissions made by the Noticees in response to the allegations made in the SCN are summarised as below:  i. The initial investment in the three Companies were initially made by the pooling of funds from the family, friends and relatives of Directors of the Companies. In pursuance thereof, 35 Acres (14.29 Hectares) of Land was purchased at Village Bhivari, Taluka Karanja Lad Dist Washim, Maharashtra in the year 1992. Details of contributions made and land purchased by the respective three Companies of the above site are as under:  Table no. 3 Sr. No.  Name of the company  Size of the land Consideration i.  Adhunik Plantation Pvt. Ltd. 4.84 hectares INR 1,01,104 ii.  Twentieth Century Pvt. Ltd. 4.60 hectares INR 93,302 iii.  Prime Plantations 4.85 hectares INR 1,01,104  Total 14.29 hectares INR 2,95,510 Order in the matter of Prime Plantations Pvt. Ltd. and others  Page 7 of 27  ii. Approximately 40,000 Teak Tree saplings were planted on the said land admeasuring 14.29 Hectare in the year 1992. The land is still in the name of the Companies and around 14000 Teak Trees are still located on land. Out of the said trees still alive, only 66 trees have some commercial value and the rest trees have no further potential of growth.  iii. The Scheme was conceptualized to enable family members and friends to make investments in a restricted manner. It was decided that investment from public will not be accepted and the same was mentioned in the application form of the scheme.  iv. The sale of Teak saplings started in November 1996 by APPL, in September 1992 by TCPL and in November 1996 by PPPL. The family members and friends were allowed to continue investing till January 3, 1998 for APPL and till March 1, 1998 for TCPL. v. The Scheme started on September 10, 1992 and continued till March 01, 1998. No investment was received by any of the Companies after March, 1998, that shows that even the last payment was received before the SEBI CIS Regulations were notified.  vi.  The details of the number of certificate holders and the amount so pooled by the said certificate holders are tabulated herein below:  Table no. 4 Sr. No.  Name of the Company No. of certificate holders/No. of families No. of Teak saplings  Amount  i.  Adhunik Plantations Pvt. Ltd 37 certificate holders  19 families  360  3,42,500 ii.  Twentieth Century Plantations Pvt. Ltd 118 certificate holders 50 families  1175  12,06,000 iii.  Prime Plantations Private Limited 69 Certificate Holders  1225  11,57,500   vii. In terms of consultation obtained by the Companies, it was advised that the Companies do not meet the eligibility criteria laid down under the SEBI CIS Regulations and therefore they cannot obtain registration. Further, it was also felt that the financial implications and ramification of registration would not be in the interest of the Certificate Holders. Order in the matter of Prime Plantations Pvt. Ltd. and others  Page 8 of 27  viii. After notification of the SEBI CIS Regulations, the Companies had conducted several meetings with the Certificate Holders to discuss the issue of winding up of the scheme with the option to either accept the Teak saplings or refund of investments.  ix. Due to various factors like drought, dropping level of ground water, insufficient power supply etc., the growth of Teak saplings was stalled. Despite best efforts the Teak saplings could not yield desired expected results.  x. The Certificate Holders unanimously decided to hold on to the saplings and the proposal to sell the saplings was not taken.  xi. In the year 2012, when it was clear that the Teak plants will not grow to their expected potential, it was decided to wind up the schemes and accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Company passed a resolution to wind up the Scheme and refund the amount to Certificate Holders on August 22, 2012. Accordingly, the following refunds have been made:  Table no. 5 Sr. no. Name of the Company Total amount mobilized/ No. of certificate holders Amount refunded/No. of certificate holders Amount yet to be repaid/No. of certificate holders i.  Adhunik Plantations Pvt. Ltd. 3,42,500/37 4,12,500/34 22,500/3 ii.  Twentieth Century Plantations Pvt. Ltd. 12,06,000/118 10,91,000/110 145000/8 iii.  Prime Plantations Pvt. Ltd. 11,57,500/69 10,60,000/61 2,12,500/8  xii. The refunds were initiated on May 29, 2004 (for PPPL and APPL) and on May 04, 2005 (for TCPL).  xiii. The scheme did not make any assurance or promise for benefit on the investment made in it. The Clause 2 of the Teak Sapling certificate states that: \"It is understood between the Certificate Holder and the Company that the transaction covered by this certificate is a sale of Teak wood tree saplings and does not constitute an investment within the meaning of any laws of the country\\\\\\\\u201d (underline supplied) xiv. Further, in terms of the Clause 5 of the Terms and Conditions of the Sale Certificate, no land was allotted under the Scheme to the certificate holders, nor the Companies have issued any instrument which could be construed as \\\\\\\\u201csecurities\\\\\\\\u201d within the meaning of Section 2 (h) of SEBI Contracts Regulations Act (SCRA). Clause 5 of Terms and Conditions of Teak Sapling Sale Certificate states as: \\\\\\\\u201cThis Scheme does not create for the Certificate Holder any title to the land where the trees stand or had stood prior to delivery to Certificate Holder. Order in the matter of Prime Plantations Pvt. Ltd. and others  Page 9 of 27  xv. The sale certificate was not in the form of a unit certificate or securities and it merely reflected the title of the Certificate Holder to the Teak Saplings, which was subject to the terms and conditions of the sale thereof.  xvi. The Scheme was limited to friends, families and relatives of the shareholders of the Companies and it was not open for subscription to the public at large to be a part of the Scheme. The Scheme was not marketed in any manner whatsoever nor was any agent engaged for the said purpose.  xvii. As the respective corpus of the funds pooled by the Companies was in the range of INR 3.42 Lakh to 12.06 Lakh, the schemes do not constitute CIS as the corpus was less than the prescribed amount of INR 100 Crore. xviii. As it was not possible to achieve the capital requirements and other compliances laid down under the SEBI CIS Regulations, steps were taken long ago to pay back to the Certificate Holders.  xix. In terms of Clauses 10-14 of the Teak Sapling Sale Certificate, the Certificate Holders were entitled to exercise the option of either taking the payment of realizable proceeds or delivery of the Teak Tree. As the trees did not grow due to factors like drought, the Certificate Holders did not exercise any option at the end of the Scheme. Further, Clause 15 had provided that the Company shall not cut trees till the Certificate Holder responds or one year from the maturity date, whichever is earlier. In terms of Clause 16, at the end of one year from the maturity date, the Company had a right to cut the trees and store them or sell them and keep the realized proceeds credited to the account of the Certificate Holder. In case the certificate holder does not respond during the total period of three years from the date of maturity, the amount or the right over the Teak Tree shall stand forfeited. xx. In many cases, the certificate holders did not exercise the said option in three years from maturity nor there was any growth in the trees, still the Companies, as a goodwill gesture refunded the amounts to the investors.   xxi. It was specified in Clause 3 of the certificate that the investment was in the agricultural forestry and the same is subject to unforeseen circumstances. The Companies had put best effort and Directors/Promoters have also infused INR 65.11 Lakh to revive the trees and to refund the Certificate Holders.   xxii. The market value of the Teak Trees at the time of maturity was less than the amounts so collected under the scheme and after cutting the trees, there was actual loss to the Certificate Holders, still the Companies have made refunds of the principal invested amount to the Certificate Holders.  xxiii. The majority of the Certificate Holders have given a Confirmation Letter wherein they have renounced their title/rights etc., arising out of the certificate and have accepted the refund.  xxiv. As the Sale Certificate clearly stated that the transaction is a sale of Teak wood tree sapling, which could be managed/nurtured by the Company on behalf of the Certificate Holder, it cannot be construed to be an investment. Order in the matter of Prime Plantations Pvt. Ltd. and others  Page 10 of 27  xxv. No fix amount as return was assured nor any ownership on the land was offered. The option provided to the Certificate Holders was either to collect the trees or proceeds from the sale of the Teak.  xxvi. The subject \\\\\\\\u2018agricultural land\\\\\\\\u2019 falls within the domain of the State and therefore, cannot be regulated by SEBI  xxvii. The business activity underlying the Scheme does not constitute a CIS as defined by Section 11AA (1) and 11AA (2) of the SEBI Act.  xxviii. All relevant documents including copy of Teak sapling sale certificate, confirmation letter from certificate holders, postal receipts etc., have been furnished to SEBI. Majority of the amounts have already been refunded, and the unpaid amounts are due only to the fact that few of the Certificate Holders have not encashed the cheques or have retuned the said cheques for different reasons. Breakup of such Certificate Holders, who have not received the payment on one ground or other are as under:  Table no. 6 Name of the Company  Certificate Holders whose cheques are cleared Certificate Holders who have not deposited refund cheques or undelivered / returned cases Total % refunded % outstanding PPPL 61 8 69 88% 12% TCPL 110 8 118 93% 7% APPL 34 3 37 92% 8% Total 205 19 224 92% 8% Order in the matter of Prime Plantations Pvt. Ltd. and others  Page 11 of 27     Table no. 7  Corpus Amount Cleared in Bank  Additional Amount Cleared in Bank Total Amount Cleared in Bank Amount Outstanding for not deposited and undelivered / returned cases % refunded % outstanding PPPL 9,45,000 1,15,000 1,060,000 2,12,500 82% 18% TCPL 10,61,000 30,000 1,091,000 1,45,000 88% 12% APPL 3,20,000 92,500 412,500 22,500 93% 7% Total 23,26,000 2,37,500 2,563,500 3,80,000 86% 14%   xxix. The above clearly shows that only INR 3.80 Lakh is pending for payment to the Certificate Holders.  xxx. This said amount is due for refund for two reasons. Few investors did not deposit the cheques delivered to them and cheques issued to certain other investors remained undelivered and were returned to the Companies.   xxxi. The Company is willing to handover Teak Trees to the complainants as well to those Certificate Holders, who are yet to be repaid. In the alternative, the refund of the said amount to such Certificate Holders would be made or the Companies may remit the same amount to SEBI/IPEF. Order in the matter of Prime Plantations Pvt. Ltd. and others  Page 12 of 27  xxxii. The auditor certified Winding up and Repayment report (WRR) has already been submitted which contains list of Certificate Holders who have been repaid and those who are yet to be repaid.   xxxiii. The WRR shows that the Schemes had matured in the year 2007-08 for PPPL and APPL, whereas the Scheme of TCPL had matured during the period of 2004-08. The said WRR also states that the refunds have been made during the period from FY 2012 to 2017.   xxxiv. Till September 01, 2016 (when the letter from SEBI was received), refunds of INR 21,59,500 were already made.  xxxv. Lots of efforts and investment for maintenance of the upkeep were done by the Companies like digging of wells for irrigation etc.  xxxvi. The complaints lodged by 6 complainants are false and frivolous as there was no provision in the Sale Certificate assuring such high returns in the range of 9900% to 26,650%, as claimed by the said complainants. As no amounts/returns were ever assured by the Companies, the complainants are not entitled to such amount as being sought by them. xxxvii. As a goodwill gesture the Companies have agreed to refund the principal sum contributed towards the Teak saplings by each Certificate Holder. In furtherance of the above, the Companies have issued refund cheque to each of such complainants, however, the complainants have not enchased those cheques, resulting in the liability remain unpaid and outstanding. Copies of cheques have been filed in support thereof.  xxxviii. The complainants have not informed the Companies in writing about their choice between getting the tree or realizable sale proceeds. Further, the complainants have not communicated with the Company for 3 years from the maturity date, hence, in terms of Clause no. 16 of the terms and condition of the Sale Certificate, rights of the complainant to seek refund stand forfeited.  xxxix.  Even assuming without admitting that the acts of the Companies were in violation of provisions of SEBI Act read with SEBI CIS Regulations, the same is only a technical violation as substantial refunds have already been made to the majority of the Certificate Holders and no loss has been caused to the public at large nor any profit has accrued to the Companies as has been alleged in the SCN. Further, the amounts involved are nominal. The alleged violation is not a repeated and only a \\\\\\\\u2018one off\\\\\\\\u2019 incident before the notification of the SEBI CIS Regulations. Reliance has been placed on the order of Hon'ble SAT passed in the matter of Samrat Holdings Limited v. SEBI (Appeal No. 23/2000 decided in January 2001), wherein Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT have observed that the discretion vested in an Adjudicating Officer has to be exercised judicially. Further reliance has been placed on the order of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matters of Piramal Enterprises Limited v SEBI, (Appeal No. 466 with 467 of 2016) and DSE Financial Services Ltd v SEBI, to support the submission that in technical violations, censure is a sufficient direction.  xl. The SCN has been issued after 20 years of the notification of SEBI CIS Regulations and by the time the said SCN was issued, majority of the refunds have already been made. The proceedings should be dropped on the ground of delay itself and reliance has been placed Order in the matter of Prime Plantations Pvt. Ltd. and others  Page 13 of 27  on the order of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT passed in the matter of Mr. Rakesh Kathotia & Ors. vs SEBI (Appeal No.7 of 2016) and Ashok Shivlal Rupani & Anr. vs SEBI. Reliance has also been placed on the order of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT passed in the matter of Pancard Club Limited Vs. SEBI (Appeal no. 254 of 2014) to submit that rationale in taking action by SEBI must be guided by fair play and powers cannot be exercised merely on speculative inferences.   5. Keeping in view the aforesaid submission by the Noticees, before I proceed to appropriately deal with the submissions made by the Noticees, it is relevant to note here that the definition of collective investment scheme has been laid down under Section 11 AA (2) of the SEBI Act, 1992, based on which it has been alleged that the aforesaid scheme launched by the Noticee nos. 1 to 3 was in the nature of collective investment scheme. Further, it is also noted that the Noticees have been confronted with the charges of violation of Section 12 (1B) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulation 3 of the SEBI CIS Regulations. In order to adjudge the charges levelled in the SCN against the Noticees, it would be apt to refer to the above-stated relevant provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and SEBI CIS Regulations, which are reproduced hereunder for facility of reference: SEBI Act, 1992  Collective investment scheme.  11AA. (1) Any scheme or arrangement which satisfies the conditions referred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section (2A) shall be a collective investment scheme:  Provided that any pooling of funds under any scheme or arrangement, which is not registered with the Board or is not covered under sub-section (3), involving a corpus amount of one hundred crore rupees or more shall be deemed to be a collective investment scheme.  (2) Any scheme or arrangement made or offered by any person under which, \\\\\\\\u2014    (i) the contributions, or payments made by the investors, by whatever name called, are pooled and utilized for the purposes of the scheme or arrangement;  (ii) the contributions or payments are made to such scheme or arrangement by the investors with a view to receive profits, income, produce or property, whether movable or immovable, from such scheme or arrangement;  (iii) the property, contribution or investment forming part of scheme or arrangement, whether identifiable or not, is managed on behalf of the investors;   (iv) the investors do not have day-to-day control over the management and operation of the scheme or arrangement. 12. Registration of stock brokers, sub-brokers, share transfer agents, etc. Order in the matter of Prime Plantations Pvt. Ltd. and others  Page 14 of 27  (1B) No person shall sponsor or cause to be sponsored or carry on or caused to be carried on any venture capital funds or collective investment schemes including mutual funds, unless he obtains a certificate of registration from the Board in accordance with the regulations: Provided that any person sponsoring or causing to be sponsored, carrying or causing to be carried on any venture capital funds or collective investment schemes operating in the securities market immediately before the commencement of the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 1995, for which no certificate of registration was required prior to such commencement, may continue to operate till such time regulations are made under clause (d) of sub-section (2) of section 30. SEBI CIS Regulations, 1999  No Person Other than Collective Investment Management Company to Launch collective investment scheme. 3. No person other than a Collective Investment Management Company which has obtained a certificate under these regulations shall carry on or sponsor or launch a collective investment scheme. 6. I have carefully perused the contents of the SCN, the regulatory provisions as quoted above and the replies filed on behalf of the Noticees. It is noted at the outset that the Noticees have prayed for dropping of charges alleged in the SCN on the ground that the same has been issued after 20 years of the notification of the SEBI CIS Regulations. In order to deal with the said argument, I deem it fit to elaborate upon the evolution of the regulatory framework pertaining to collective investment schemes.  7. In this connection, it is noted that Section 11(2) (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 as existed in the originally introduced SEBI Act, 1992, inter alia empowers SEBI to take measures for registering and regulating the working of collective investment schemes. Further, Section 12 (1B) was inserted in the SEBI Act, 1992 by the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 1995, w.e.f January 25, 1995, which stipulated that no person shall carry out collective investment scheme, without obtaining registration from SEBI. Further, vide Press Release dated November 18, 1997, the Government of India communicated its decision that schemes through which instruments such as agro bonds, plantation bonds, etc., issued by the entities, would be treated as schemes under the SEBI Act, 1992 and SEBI would frame regulations in order to regulate these Schemes. Subsequently, a press release dated November 26, 1997 was issued by SEBI, wherein it was stated that the process of framing of regulations is in process and till the time the said regulations are framed, no person can sponsor or cause to be sponsored, carry on or cause to be carried on any new CIS. It was further notified that persons desirous of availing the benefits of the proviso to Section 12 (1B) of SEBI Act, 1992 may send the information within 21 days. Another public notice dated December 18, 1997 was issued by SEBI, inter alia directing the existing schemes to comply with Section 12 (1B) of SEBI Act, 1992 and to send the desired information to SEBI. Order in the matter of Prime Plantations Pvt. Ltd. and others  Page 15 of 27  Finally, on October 15, 1999, the SEBI (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 1999, were notified.  8. As noted above, by various press release by the Government of India as well as by SEBI, the persons who were running collective investment scheme were notified about the prohibitions imposed on such activities and the companies engaged in such schemes were directed to file the relevant information with SEBI. Admittedly, the Noticee nos. 1 to 3, have never filed any information with respect to the schemes of Teak Trees that they were running at that particular point of time. It is noted from the records that during the year 2016, certain investors, who had invested in the Schemes of the Noticee nos. 1 to 3, have made complaints with SEBI and based on such complaints, SEBI swung into action and exchanged various communication with the Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 3. Based on the information so furnished by the Noticees and other materials available on record, the SCN has been issued in the present matter. Therefore, when the facts of the case indicate that the Noticee nos. 1 to 3 did not furnish the requisite information during the period 1997-1998 and the fact that these three Noticees continued to remain engaged in running a collective investment scheme which came to the knowledge of SEBI only in the year 2016 pursuant to the complaints received by SEBI, the Noticees are not entitled to raise any objection now to the SCN taking a plea of delay of 20 years in issuance of the SCN.  9. Additionally, I note that provisions of the the SEBI Act, 1992 do not prescribe for any limitation for initiation of proceedings, issuance of show cause notice or for completion of the quasi-judicial proceedings. In this respect, reference may be made to the order passed by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Metex Marketing Pvt. Ltd. vs. SEBI (DoD: June 04, 2019) wherein Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT held that: \\\\\\\\u201cThis Tribunal has consistently held that in the absence of any specific provision in the SEBI Act or in the Takeover Regulations, the fact that there was a delay on the part of SEBI in initiating proceedings for violation of any provision of the Act cannot be a ground to quash the penalty imposed for such violation\\\\\\\\u201d. 10. Further, in order to ascertain as to whether there has been actually any delay in the matter, it is the date when the violation came to the notice of the SEBI should be the relevant point and not the date when the alleged violation was committed.

Show Cause Notice having reference no. SEBI/HO/EAD/E&AO/SR/AS/OW/11708/1/2020 dated July 14, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019), was issued to Concept in terms of Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against Concept and why penalty, if any, should not be imposed upon Concept under Section 23D of SCRA and Section 15HB of SEBI Act, for the violations alleged to have been committed by Concept.   6. The allegations that were levelled against Concept in the SCN are as under:  Failure to segregate securities and monies of client(s)  (i.) During the inspection, a sample comprising of all 19 trading days in the month of February 2018, was selected to detect possible misutilization of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds. At the time of inspection, reconciliation of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds lying with the Noticee with total available funds i.e. cash and cash equivalents with Noticee and with the Clearing Corporation, based on principles and guidelines stipulated in clause 3 of SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated September 26, 2016, was carried out. It was  noted that on all sample dates, total fund balance in all client bank accounts and collaterals deposited Noticee with Clearing Corporation/Clearing Member were less than the total credit balance of clients, by an amount ranging from Rs 20.93 lakhs to Rs 4.07 crore.   (ii.) Thus, it is alleged that by utilizing funds of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 having credit balance for settlement obligations of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 having debit balance, Noticee has violated Section 23D of the SCRA, 1956 read with SEBI circular SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated Adjudication Order in respect of Concept Securities Private Limited (now merged with R. Wadiwala Securities Private Limited)  Page 4 of 35  November 18, 1993 and clause 3.3.1 of Annexure of SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated September 26, 2016.  Non-settlement of funds and securities of clients   (iii.) During the inspection, it was verified whether the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 accounts were settled on monthly/quarterly basis as per the preference obtained from the clients, by considering the ledger balances of clients across Exchanges/Segments and collaterals, cash maintained as margin against retention of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 obligation, cash market turnover and margin requirement. It was noted that for a sample of 10 inactive clients who had not traded but funds/security was available with the Noticee, monthly/quarterly settlement for one client for an amount of Rs 41.74 lakhs had not been done.   (iv.) Thus, it was observed that by not carrying out monthly/quarterly settlement for one client, Noticee has allegedly violated clause 12 of SEBI circular SEBI/MIRSD/Cir-19/2009 dated December 03, 2009 and clause 8.1.1 of SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated September 26, 2016.  Client Funding  (v.) Client ledgers of 50 clients for the IP, selected based on highest delay payment charges levied on the clients were studied and it was observed that in 2 instances out of 100 instances checked, Noticee provided further exposure to clients after five days i.e. starting with 6th working day from pay-in date of securities, in spite of non-recovery of debit balances (after considering free collaterals).   (vi.) Thus, it was observed that Noticee has allegedly violated clause 2.6 of Annexure of SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated September 26, 2016 read with clause 2(d) of SEBI circular CIR/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2017/64 dated June 22, 2017. Adjudication Order in respect of Concept Securities Private Limited (now merged with R. Wadiwala Securities Private Limited)  Page 5 of 35   Verification of Email ID and Mobile numbers   (vii.) Further, a sample comprising of all active clients who had traded in the IP was studied and verified email IDs and mobile numbers uploaded with in Unique Client Code (in short UCC) database of BSE with the records available with Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s back office were verified.  Further, it was also verified whether single email ID and mobile number was mapped to multiple clients and whether email IDs and mobile numbers of all active clients were uploaded to the Exchange.  It was noted that mobile numbers of 2330 clients and email IDs of 445 clients were not uploaded in the UCC database and there were instances of multiple IDs being used for 2144 clients and multiple mobile numbers being used for 3680 clients.  (viii.) Thus, it was observed that Noticee has allegedly violated clause 2(b) of SEBI circular CIR/MIRSD/15/2011 dated August 02, 2011.  Enhanced Supervision data  (ix.) During the course of inspection, Enhanced Supervision Data submitted by Noticee to BSE was studied and verification was carried out with respect to (i) details of bank account and demat accounts submitted to BSE, (ii) number of clients whose ledger balance was required to be reported to BSE for the month of April 2018, (iii) name tagging of demat account and (iv) timely reporting of data done by Noticee. A sample comprising of the number of clients whose balances were required to be reported to BSE for the month of April 2018 and the number of bank accounts and demat accounts to be reported to BSE, was selected and it was observed that in 72 instances for email IDs and in 114 instances for mobile numbers (details enclosed as Annexure F), data uploaded in \\\\\\\\u201cclient fund and securities module\\\\\\\\u201d under Enhanced Supervision for December 2018 did not match with UCC database.   (x.) Thus, it was noted that Noticee has allegedly violated clause 6.1.1(e) SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated September 26, 2016 to be read with Exchange Notice Nos. 20160927-41, dated September 27, 2016. Adjudication Order in respect of Concept Securities Private Limited (now merged with R. Wadiwala Securities Private Limited)  Page 6 of 35  7. The SCN issued to Concept was digitally signed and sent through email dated July 15, 2020 and Concept was given fifteen days\\\\\\\\u2019 time from the date of the receipt of the SCN to file its reply.  As no reply to the SCN was received, vide email dated August 11, 2020, Concept was requested to submit the reply to the SCN at the earliest. Later on it was gathered that the SCN, issued to Concept vide email dated July 15, 2020, could not be delivered to due to some technical issue. Subsequently, the aforesaid SCN was sent through Speed Post AD at the last known address of Concept on August 28, 2020. From the material available on record, I note that SCN was duly delivered to Concept on August 31, 2020.  Vide its letter as well as email dated September 11, 2020, Concept submitted its reply to the SCN.     8. An opportunity of personal hearing on January 28, 2021 was granted to Concept vide hearing notice EAD-10/SM/22792/1/2020 dated December 24, 2020, which was duly served upon Concept.  Vide email dated December 31, 2020, the Noticee i.e. R. Wadiwala Securities Pvt. Ltd., submitted that they had entered into an agreement with the shareholders of Concept in March 2019 for acquisition of 100% of its shares followed by merger. Subsequent to receipt of prior approval of SEBI, they acquired all the shares in November 2019 and filed Scheme of Amalgamation with the Regional Director, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Ahmedabad. The Regional Director, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, approved the Scheme of Amalgamation by its order dated November 10, 2020. Thereafter, the Noticee completed the process of transition on December 25, 2020. Vide the aforesaid email, the Noticee submitted that they were replying to the SCN since they had acquired the company to whom the SCN was issued. Vide letter dated January 12, 2021, the Noticee submitted certain clarification to the earlier reply dated September 11, 2020 submitted by Concept in the matter.  9. The personal hearing was availed by the Noticee on January 28, 2021, through its Authorized Representative (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018AR\\\\\\\\u2019). During the hearing, the AR reiterated the contents of the earlier replies submitted in the matter.  The Noticee also sought one week\\\\\\\\u2019s time to file additional reply. Thereafter, the Noticee filed its reply vide email dated February 11, 2021, wherein it provided additional details and also requested that the order be qua Concept (and not Noticee) since at the time of inspection and during the period of inspection, Concept was in full operation and the merger happened post inspection.   10. Concept and the Noticee, vide their letters/emails dated  September 11, 2020,  January 12, 2021 and February 11, 2021, inter-alia, submitted as under: Adjudication Order in respect of Concept Securities Private Limited (now merged with R. Wadiwala Securities Private Limited)  Page 7 of 35   I. Letter dated September 11, 2020  1. Failure to segregate securities and monies of client(s):   a. \\\\\\\\u201cWe had sufficient fund available to meet with all the obligations to all the clients throughout the month. On two points, we were slightly non-compliant; one considered fund available in our overdraft account and BMC (Base Minimum Capital) in calculating. This overdraft and BMC part was soon rectified on better understanding norms. During February 2019, we were maintaining required balances on monthly basis and were considering BMC (Base Minimum Capital) as an available fund. We had sufficient balances in our overdraft account to meet the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 obligation.   b. Basic purpose of this SEBI norm is to ensure that payments to clients are not delayed due to non-availability of fund we had sufficient fund with us to meet with complete obligation at a stretch, with some part in Overdraft limit.  c. We have ensured right fund in our bank accounts thereafter. So this was only for a small period. From 18 March 2019 onwards we are maintaining these balances on daily basis. In the reply to the preliminary observations we had submitted data for April -19. We are submitting data of latest 3 months in Annexure-1. We request your authority to pardon this since this was not deliberate and have been corrected and complied after March 2019 till date.\\\\\\\\u201d  2. Non-settlement of funds and securities of clients:   a. \\\\\\\\u201cBecause of some back-office issue, client No. 113017 was not shown in pending retention list during regular process. So we could not settle. We have resolved it and account has been settled.  b. It may be noted that client code 113017 is of our associate company Concept Commodities Private Limited which has been subsequently merged with this company with retrospective effect 1st April 2017. NCLT order No. CP (CAA)49-5/NCLT/AHM/2019 was issued on 4th July 2019. Order was issued in July 2019 Adjudication Order in respect of Concept Securities Private Limited (now merged with R. Wadiwala Securities Private Limited)  Page 8 of 35  however date of merger is 1st April 2017. So technically, if we can consider this merger with the effective date (01/04/2017), this amount of Rs. 41.74 lakhs not settled is a part of this company as on date. Please given us benefit of this merger and consider this as compliant.\\\\\\\\u201d    3. Client Funding  \\\\\\\\u201cIt was operational error. We have made necessary changes in our system, so that such error does not occur in future\\\\\\\\u201d.  4. Verification of email id and mobile number  a. \\\\\\\\u201cOur first comment is that figures look high because of data of inactive clients also considered in the observations made.   b. It seems that BSE UCC was verified with Enhanced Supervision Data (ESD). At that time, we were required to report only active clients in Enhanced Supervision Data. However, we were reporting both active and inactive clients in ESD. According to our internal policy, we collect latest data at the time of reactivation. So obviously data of inactive clients were not updated. If we consider only the data of active clients that we should have reported in ESD, analysis of actual data is given here below:  b. Analysis of actual data is as per below:  a. Without mobile numbers: Out of 2330 (without mobile numbers) clients referred in your letter, only 11 clients had traded during the inspection period. Out of 11, one client had given declaration for not having mobile number.   b. Without Email Id: These 445 (Without email IDs) clients have not traded during the inspection period. So there is no violation.   c. (Multiple Email Ids) Out of 2144 clients, only 1220 clients had traded during the inspection period. 608 email ids are used against these clients. We have taken Adjudication Order in respect of Concept Securities Private Limited (now merged with R. Wadiwala Securities Private Limited)  Page 9 of 35  family declaration of 346 email ids. If we remove inactive clients, numbers of instances of multiple email ids would go down.   d.  (Multiple Mobile Numbers) Out of 3680 clients, only 1560 clients had traded during the inspection period. 829 mobile numbers are used against these clients. We have taken family declaration of 390 clients. If we remove inactive clients, numbers of instances of multiple mobile numbers would go down.   e. We have tabulated details of c) and d) here above in a table for better/clear idea. This table is given here below:  Narration Multiple Mobile Numbers Multiple Email IDs No. Of Clients 3680 2141 Active Clients (Turnover during IP) 1560 1220 Unique Mobile Numbers/Email IDs 829 608 Family Declaration Received 391 346 No. of Active Clients with Single Mobile Number/Email ID Corresponding Mobile Number/Email ID belongs to inactive clients 267 144 HUF Clients 35 26 PMS Category Clients 11 9 Pending 125 83  5. Enhanced Supervision data  a. \\\\\\\\u201cEnhanced Supervision Data for the month of December 2018 was compared with latest BSE UCC (February 2019). Some mismatch is on account of comparing data of different point of time. Ideally, team should have compared the date of the same date both stock exchange and UCC. Out of 72 instances for email IDs, 14 clients had not traded during the inspection period. Out of remaining 58 clients, 4 clients are not registered in BSE (Registered only in NSE or MCX). Out of remaining 54 clients, 39 had applied for modification between December 2018 - February 2019. So numbers are much less for these observations.   b. Out of 114 instances for mobile numbers, 88 clients had not traded during the inspection period. Out of remaining 26 clients, 04 clients are not registered in BSE (Registered only in NSE or MCX). 05 clients are NRI and their mobile Adjudication Order in respect of Concept Securities Private Limited (now merged with R. Wadiwala Securities Private Limited)  Page 10 of 35  numbers are not in standard format of 10 digits. Exchanges doesn\\\\\\\\u2019t allow less than or greater than 10 digits mobile numbers. Out of 17 clients, 10 clients had applied for modification between December 2018 - February 2019.   Narration Multiple Mobile Numbers Multiple Email IDs Instances Observed by OD 114 72 Active Clients (Turnover during IP) 26 58 No. of Clients not Registered in BSE 4 4 Applied for Modification between Dec-18 to Feb-19 10 39 NRI Clients 5 0  c. Further we would like to make a point that all above observations are operational errors and not intentional wrongdoing.\\\\\\\\u201d   II. Reply dated January 12, 2021  1. Non-settlement of funds and securities of client   \\\\\\\\u201cwe have cited back-office issue in client code 113017 Concept Commodities Private Limited for not settling account. We had done email communication with the back-office vendor Tech-Excel citing this problem. We are attaching copy of this communication to substantiate. Incidentally, this client code is of the associate company which was merged with this company with retrospective effect.\\\\\\\\u201d  III. Reply dated February 11,2021   1. Non-settlement of funds and securities of client  \\\\\\\\u201cThe client wise steps had been taken by us for settlement of inactive clients. We have described the efforts taken and also placed evidence of efforts made to connect with inactive clients. Numbers of clients were pretty old and untraceable.  But we did not appropriate their credit amount or adjust stock in any other way. So, we have maintained our ethics in this. Adjudication Order in respect of Concept Securities Private Limited (now merged with R. Wadiwala Securities Private Limited)  Page 11 of 35  As regards to the amount of Fixed Deposit, it is more than the obligations. We would like to make a point that in case of quarterly settlements of funds/securities, we have been carrying forward obligations of clients as it was. Some of the clients are pretty old, older than our membership. We have been honest with our clients.\\\\\\\\u201d  2. Verification of email id and mobile number  \\\\\\\\u201cAs per the exchange circular number NSE/INSP/27368 and BSE notice number 2014081917 guidelines for inactive clients, we have uploaded common mobile number as well as common email ids as per the circulars of respective exchanges. Simultaneously, all the accounts had been marked inactive means no further trade allowed. At the time of reactivation, after completion of KYC requirements only, client would allowed for further trading\\\\\\\\u201d   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS  11. I have carefully perused the charges levelled replies filed in the matter and other documents/ material available on record. I note from the email dated December 31, 2020 filed by the Noticee that Concept, whose inspection was carried out and against whom charges were levelled in the SCN, merged with the Noticee as per the order of Regional Director of Ministry of Corporate Affairs dated November 10, 2020.  The scheduled hearing in the matter was also attended by the Noticee through its AR.   12. The Noticee, vide its email dated February 12,2020, submitted a copy of the scheme of arrangement (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019) in the nature of amalgamation between  \\\\\\\\u201cR. WADIWALA SECURITIES PRIVATE LIMITED AND CONCEPT SECURIITES PRIVATE LIMITED AND THEIR  RESPECTIVE SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS UNDER SECTION 233 OF THE COMPANIES ACT,2013.\\\\\\\\u201d On perusal of the scheme, I note that the Noticee was a holding company of the erstwhile Concept. As specified in para 10.1 of the Scheme, all the legal proceedings may be continued against the Transferee Company. The said para is reproduced below:- Adjudication Order in respect of Concept Securities Private Limited (now merged with R. Wadiwala Securities Private Limited)  Page 12 of 35  10.1 Legal Proceedings:  \\\\\\\\u201cAll suits, actions, and other proceedings including legal and taxation proceedings (including before any statutory or quasi-judicial authority or tribunal) of whatsoever nature by or against the Transferor Company is pending, the same shall not abate or be discontinued or in any way be prejudicially affected by reason of or by anything contained in this Scheme, but the said suit, appeal or other legal proceedings may be continued, prosecuted and enforced by or against the Transferee Company in the same manner and to the same extent as it would or might have been continued, prosecuted and enforced by or against Transferor Company, as if this Scheme had not been made.\\\\\\\\u201d  13. Further, I note from para 17 of the scheme that \\\\\\\\u201con the scheme becoming effective, the transferor company has been dissolved without following the process of winding up as per provision of section 233(8) of Companies Act, 2013, and the name of the transferor company shall be struck off from the records of Registrar of Companies, Gujarat\\\\\\\\u201d. I note from records that scheme came into effect from April 1, 2019.    14. In this regard, I observe that Sections 233(9) (a) to (d) of Companies Act, 2013 list out the provisions in respect of transfer of property/liabilities of Transferor Company to Transferee Company, in the event of such scheme getting registered.  In these provisions, it is held that the liabilities, charges on the property, legal proceedings etc. in respect of/against  transferor company shall continue in respect of/against the transferee company.  The provisions of Section 233(9)(a) to (d) of Companies Act, 2013 are reproduced as under:-   Section 233(9): The registration of the scheme shall have the following effects, namely:  (a) transfer of property or liabilities of the transferor company to the transferee company so that the property becomes the property of the transferee company and the liabilities become the liabilities of the transferee company;  (b) the charges, if any, on the property of the transferor company shall be applicable and enforceable as if the charges were on the property of the transferee company;  (c) legal proceedings by or against the transferor company pending before any court of law shall be continued by or against the transferee company; and Adjudication Order in respect of Concept Securities Private Limited (now merged with R. Wadiwala Securities Private Limited)  Page 13 of 35   (d) where the scheme provides for purchase of shares held by the dissenting shareholders or settlement of debt due to dissenting creditors, such amount, to the extent it is unpaid, shall become the liability of the transferee company.  15. In view of the above, since as on date Concept is dissolved, the present Adjudication proceedings will continue against the Noticee i.e. R. Wadiwala Securities Pvt. Ltd.  (Transferee Company) instead of Concept. Thus, hereinafter the matter would be dealt with in respect of the Noticee.   16. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are:  Issue No. I: Whether the Noticee has violated the following provisions of SCRA/ Regulations/ Circulars:   (i) Section 23D of SCRA read with SEBI circular no.

From the above table, it is noted that fees charged by PMA for various Services ranges from Rs.15,000/- on Monthly basis to Rs.7,51,000/- Half Yearly basis, based on the segment. It is observed that the monthly return assured ranges between 30% to 200%.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Money Advisor                                                                                       Page 8 of 22  13. Further, from www.whois.com database, it is noted that the domain name profitmoneyadvisor.net was created on December 02, 2019, for which the expiry mentioned is December 02, 2021, and the last update date is December 08, 2020.   14. Bank Account / payment details:   14.1. The bank account details which was mentioned on the webpages of the website of PMA is as follows:  S.No. Details Particulars 1 Account Name Profit Money Advisor 2 Bank Name/Payment Gateway Central Bank of India 3 Account Number 3790292068  4 IFSC Code  CBIN0281013 5 Branch Code TT Nagar, Madhya Pradesh 6 Date of Account Opening December 11, 2019 7 Bank Statement Period December 11, 2019 to March 04, 2021 8 No. of Credit Transaction 701 9 Date of last Credit 04/03/2021  10 Total Credit  Rs.68,48,431/-  14.2. From the analysis of bank statement, the following is observed:  14.2.1. The aforesaid bank account is still active.   14.2.2. The total credit received in the aforesaid bank account is approximately Rs. 68,48,431/- during the period December 11, 2019 to March 04, 2021. 14.2.3. There are continuous credits in the bank account, of instance, 16 credit entries on November 25, 2020 and 18 credit entries on November 26, 2020.  14.2.4. Credits in the bank statement are as recent as 04/03/2021. There are four credit transactions during March 01-04, 2021, amounting to Rs.55001/-.  15. Further PMA had put up a whatapp and Paytm number +9109368967 on its website for clients who wish to subscribe to their \\\\\\\\u2018advisory services\\\\\\\\u2019. It is observed that from these two mode of payment, Paytm is still available for making payment to PMA.  16. In light of the aforesaid, I prima facie observe that PMA has put information in public domain / advertising by using website namely www.profitmoneyadvisor.net  about the various services offered by it in securities market. It is also prima facie observed that__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Money Advisor                                                                                       Page 9 of 22  various plans / packages were being offered by PMA to avail their Services. Thus, I observe that PMA is prima facie, holding itself out as an investment Adviser. In view of the above facts and circumstances, especially the content of the website created on December 02, 2019, coupled with the credit transactions in the bank account opened on December 11, 2019, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees / funds credited to the bank accounts, were for the purpose of availing the services indicated on the website of PMA and it is carrying out services related to investments in securities market as mentioned on its website and it is acting as an advisor in securities market from December 02, 2019, till date.    17. In this regard, I have perused the definition of investment Adviser as given in regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, which states that investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment Adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have also perused the Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines investment advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d    18. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is, noted from the contents of the website of PMA, that PMA is prima facie, holding itself out as investment Adviser by offering to provide services related to investing in, purchasing and selling securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription and these services fall within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advice\\\\\\\\u201d under Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations. Further, multiple and continuous credit entries have been received in the bank accounts, which when seen together with the contents of the website, leads to, on preponderance of probability basis, a prima facie, conclusion that the credit entries in the bank account are consideration for the investment advice given by PMA to its__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Money Advisor                                                                                       Page 10 of 22  clients. Thus, prima facie, PMA is an investment Adviser as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations.    19. The fact that PMA is offering various subscription packages in various segments of the market viz, equity, derivatives, forex and commodity, when seen in light of the receipt of money in its bank accounts, prima facie shows, on preponderance of probability basis, that the credit of money, is in fact, the fee for the investment advisory services rendered by PMA. Therefore, PMA has not only held itself out as investment Adviser but has also acted as an Investment Adviser for consideration.    Issue No 2:  If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether PMA has, prima facie, violated any provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) read with SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (\\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) and the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (\\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d)?   20. In order to ensure that investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, states that  \\\\\\\\u201cNo  stock  broker,  sub -broker,  share  transfer  agent,  banker  to  an  issue,  trustee  of  trust deed,  registrar  to  an  issue,  merchant  banker,  underwriter,  portfolio  manager,  investment Adviser  and  such  other  intermediary  who  may  be  associated  with  securities  market  shall  buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration  obtained  from  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the regulations  made under  this Act\\\\\\\\u201d    21. Further, Regulation 3(1) of the IA regulations, states that \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment Adviser or hold itself out as an investment Adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Money Advisor                                                                                       Page 11 of 22  22. Thus, as per Section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Regulation 3(1) of IA Regulations, any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI regulations, i.e. the registration of the investment Advisers is mandatory.     23. The activities of PMA, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions shows that, PMA is holding itself out as investment adviser and is acting as investment adviser. However, no material is available on record to indicate that PMA or its proprietor Shri. Prateek Singh in their individual capacity had a certificate of registration as an investment adviser. In this context, it is noted that PMA and Shri. Prateek Singh in their individual capacity are not registered with SEBI in any capacity. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by PMA, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, leads to the conclusion that PMA is holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser without a certificate of registration from SEBI. Thus, in my view, these activities/representations of PMA are, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.   24. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and Regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of the PFUTP Regulations. The text of the aforesaid provisions is reproduced below:  SEBI Act Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control Section 12A: No person shall directly or indirectly:  (a) use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Money Advisor                                                                                       Page 12 of 22  (b) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange; (c) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  PFUTP Regulations Regulation 3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities No person shall directly or indirectly- (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under; (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.  4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a manipulative, fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities market.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Money Advisor                                                                                       Page 13 of 22  (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a manipulative fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves any of the following: -      \\\\\\\\u2026 (k) disseminating information or advice through any media, whether physical or digital, which the disseminator knows to be false or misleading and which is designed or likely to influence the decision of investors dealing in securities\\\\\\\\u201d.  25. In my view, an unregistered investment adviser like PMA, can put investors at great risk by misleading them. Without having a registered investment adviser certificate, PMA is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients with the objective of making money/collecting fees through various services and packages. Further, PMA has put in information in public domain / advertising by using website namely www.profitmoneyadvisor.net  about the various services/packages offered by it in securities market. It is also prima facie observed that various plans / packages being offered by PMA assure monthly return from 30% to 200%.  26. Thus, by making the aforesaid claims of assured \\\\\\\\u201cmonthly return\\\\\\\\u201d, between 30% to 200%, PMA is, prima facie, inducing investors to deal in securities by availing its services. Such modus operandi is being continuously used by PMA, which is evident from the fact that there are continuous credits in its bank accounts.  27. It is observed that PMA\\\\\\\\u2019s claim to provide a specific monthly return on client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment, is, prima facie, an active concealment of the material fact that every investment in the market is subject to market risk. Considering the dynamics of the market, the returns from the investment in the market are unpredictable, no matter how much and for how long the investment is made. This act of conveying specific monthly returns is, prima facie, indulged for the purpose of luring customers in its net and thereby increasing its income. In light of the same, the act of PMA to actively conceal material information and giving misleading assurance of 30% to 200%__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Money Advisor                                                                                       Page 14 of 22  monthly return on investment, is non-genuine and a deceptive act and has been, prima facie, made with an intent to influence the client to avail its advisory services.  28. The above discussed omission and act of PMA are, prima facie, fraudulent and are covered under the definition of 'fraud' defined under regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations which reads as under:  29. \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d includes any act, expression, omission or concealment committed whether in a deceitful manner or not by a person or by any other person with his connivance or by his agent while dealing in securities in order to induce another person or his agent to deal in securities, whether or not there is any wrongful gain or avoidance of any loss, and shall also include-- (1) a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of material fact in order that another person may act to his detriment; (2) a suggestion as to a fact which is not true by one who does not believe it to be true; (3) an active concealment of a fact by a person having knowledge or belief of the fact; (4) a promise made without any intention of performing it; (5) a representation made in a reckless and careless manner whether it be true or false; (6) any such act or omission as any other law specifically declares to be fraudulent; (7) deceptive behaviour by a person depriving another of informed consent or full participation; (8) a false statement made without reasonable ground for believing it to be true; (9) the act of an issuer of securities giving out misinformation that affects the market price of the security, resulting in investors being effectively misled even though they did not rely on the statement itself or anything derived from it other than the market price.  And \\\\\\\\u201cfraudulent\\\\\\\\u201d shall be construed accordingly;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Money Advisor                                                                                       Page 15 of 22  30. It is noted that, prima facie, fraudulent activities / conduct / act / practice of PMA as discussed above are, prima facie, in violation of provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and Regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of the PFUTP Regulations.   Issue No. 3:  If answers to Issue Nos. 1 & 2 are affirmative, who are responsible for the violations?  31. I note that Shri. Prateek Singh is the sole proprietor of PMA. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in Ashok Transport Agency vs. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that, \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business.

(Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 in respect of Ashika Capital Limited, registered Merchant Banker - SEBI Registration No. INM000010536 In the Matter of Sudar Industries Limited  _____________________________________________________________________ 1. Background \\\\\\\\u2013 1.1. The present matter emanates from an investigation carried out by SEBI into the IPO of Sudar Industries Ltd. (the \\\\\\\\u201cCompany\\\\\\\\u201d/ \\\\\\\\u201cSIL\\\\\\\\u201d), for which Ashika Capital Limited (the \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d/ \\\\\\\\u201cAshika\\\\\\\\u201d) was the Book Running Lead Manager (\\\\\\\\u201cBRLM\\\\\\\\u201d). Consequent to such investigation, lapses in Ashika\\\\\\\\u2019s role as the BRLM were found, and it was inter alia proposed that enquiry proceedings be initiated against it.      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 2 of 36    2. Enquiry proceedings against Ashika \\\\\\\\u2013 2.1. Consequent to the investigation undertaken by SEBI, Enquiry Proceedings were initiated against Ashika, a registered intermediary, in terms of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cIntermediaries Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), by appointing a Designated Authority (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cDA\\\\\\\\u201d) in respect thereof.  2.2. Pursuant to the said appointment, the DA issued a SCN dated December 15, 2017 bearing number SEBI/EAD-12/SM/EE/31892/2017. The SCN alleged violation of the following provisions of law, viz.\\\\\\\\u2014 a. Regulation 60 (7) (a ) of the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009; b. Regulation 64 (1) of the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009; and c. Regulation 13 of the SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992 read with Clauses 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 21 of Schedule III, SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992. 2.3. A summary of the facts brought out in the Enquiry Report is provided hereunder: a. Non-disclosure of Independent director\\\\\\\\u2019s involvement in key strategic and financial decisions: Deepak Shenoy, who was an independent director of SIL, was concurrently holding two positions: one as an employee in Finaventure Advisory Services India Pvt. Ltd (now Virtuous Capital Ltd,      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 3 of 36    hereinafter also referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cFASIPL\\\\\\\\u201d) and the other as an Independent Director SIL. FASIPL and Deepak Shenoy were providing consultancy to SIL on the IPO, while at the same time, Deepak Shenoy was an Independent Director, which required him to independently look at the workings of SIL, so as to protect the interest of the public/minority shareholders. The above two positions being held by Deepak Shenoy were clearly in conflict with each other. Also, as a director, Deepak Shenoy was involved closely with the key strategic and financial decisions, which was not in consonance with his role as an independent director. This was a clear risk factor which should have been brought out by the Merchant Banker in the Offer Documents. However, no disclosure with respect to the role of Deepak Shenoy was made under internal risk factors in the prospectus of SIL.  b. Heavy dependence on few buyers/suppliers and non-disclosure of the buyers and suppliers being related to the promoters and the promoter group: SIL has been highly dependent on its top three to four clients for around 80% of its revenues. The top three customers, accounting for around 70% and 80% of the turnover of the company for the financial year 2008-09 and 2009-10 respectively were Shalom Fashion, Addon Exports and MTV Exports and the some of the said buyers and sellers were related to the promoters and promoter group. However, the merchant banker has provided wrong disclosures pertaining to the customers and suppliers and their relation with the promoters and the promoter group.      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 4 of 36    c. Wrong disclosures made in the offer document regarding KMPs: Disclosures with respect to details of KMPs and details of arrangement between KMPs with major shareholders, customers, suppliers of the issuer company has to be disclosed in the prospectus by virtue of ICDR regulations. However, the disclosures with respect to the above have been wrongly made in the prospectus of SIL.   d. Non \\\\\\\\u2013 Disclosure of Related Party Transactions: The Noticee Company did not disclose the transactions with Addon Exports, A R Fabrics, Elim Traders, R J Traders and Shalom Fashion in the Related Party Transactions despite the fact that all these firms were proprietary concerns of employees of SIL and/or connected/related to its KMP. 2.4. For the lapses as stated above, the DA, in his report dated June 16, 2020, found that Ashika had contravened the provisions as enumerated at 2.2 (a), (b) and (c) above. In view of the same, the DA in terms of provisions of Regulation 27 of the Intermediaries Regulations recommended that the Noticee may be issued a strong warning and advised to ensure strict compliance with the applicable provisions of securities law in future.  3. Post \\\\\\\\u2013 Enquiry SCN dated August 11, 2020 \\\\\\\\u2013 3.1. After  considering the  Enquiry  Report, post \\\\\\\\u2013enquiry SCN dated  August 11, 2020 under  Regulation  28(1)  of  the Intermediaries  Regulations was  issued to  Ashika (enclosing therewith  a  copy  of  the  Enquiry  Report),  calling upon  it  to  show      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 5 of 36    cause  as  to  why  action  as recommended by the DA or any other penalty/direction should not be imposed on it in terms of Regulation 28 (1) and (2) of the Intermediaries Regulations, as deemed fit, by the Designated Member (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cDM\\\\\\\\u201d).  3.2. An opportunity of personal hearing before the DM was granted to the Noticee on January 06, 2021. Mr. Narendra Kumar, Vice President appeared on behalf of the Noticee. The oral submissions made at the personal hearing on January 06, 2021; the reply to the SCN, dated September 01, 2020;  and the submissions made by the Noticee by way of its reply dated February 16, 2018 before the DA, to the extent relevant to the present proceedings, are summarised hereunder  \\\\\\\\u2013 a. The non-compliances/deficiencies brought out in the Enquiry Report were not due to any fault of Ashika Capital but that of Sudar Industries Limited. b. Two show cause notices have been issued against Ashika Capital with respect to the allegation of lack of due diligence and in respect of one show-cause notice Adjudication Order has already been passed where a penalty of Rs. 5,00,000 was imposed. c. Considering that penalty has already been imposed on Ashika Capital, the present proceedings under the above mentioned SCN may be dropped.      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 6 of 36    d. With  respect to independent director, Deepak  Shenoy,  post  receipt  of observations in the  CRISIL Report  dated January 21 2011,  enquiries were  from   the   CMD  of  SIL,  Murugan Muthiah Thevar  as to role of Deepak  Shenoy in the  key and strategic decisions of  SIL.  At  the   relevant  time,   it was given   to understand by   Murugan Muthiah Thevar that since he was educated till  Matriculate only,  it  was  difficult  for  him  to  understand document presentation. Moreover, he was not very conversant with the English language and was comfortable only in vernacular language. Hence,   he   had   taken Deepak Shenoy   for   the   purpose of meeting with CRISIL/ other   offices for more clarity on the issues. Further, Murugan  Muthiah Thevar   had   confirmed   that  Deepak Shenoy  had  no  role to play in the  business and  financial decisions of SIL, which  were taken by CMD along with other Members of the  BoDs. During interactions with SIL officials, at no point of time involvement of Deepak Shenoy in the day to day affairs of SIL was visible. At the relevant time, it was also confirmed by the CMD of SIL, Murugan Muthiah Thevar that there were no financial transactions etc. of SIL with either Deepak Shenoy/his family members etc. e. The CRISIL report was  received  after  21st January 2011 and  the  IPO  was  slated for 21st February 2011, between which  the required level  of due  diligence  was  conducted.  Although nothing was found that      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 7 of 36    indicated day to day involvement  of Deepak Shenoy in the operational affairs of SIL, the details given in the CRISIL report was stated as Internal Risk  factor  no. 1 at  Page  No. 11.   f. The role of an Independent Director as a Member of the Board of Director is to contribute in strategic decisions, which helps in the growth of the Company. During the relevant time, there was no requirement of Independent Director as per Companies Act,   1956. Hence,  there   were  no  specific  guidelines under the Companies Act,  1956  for  a due  diligence  process in respect of Independent Directors. g. For the due  diligence  of the customers of the  Company including Shalom Fashion, Addon  Exports, MTV Exports and  India  Fashion, a team  had  visited  the  registered office of the  Company at Vashi, Navi Mumbai and  Factory at Khalapur Taluka, Raigad District and had  carried out  the  verification of Sales Bill, Confirmation or statement of account received of trade debtors and discussion with the management and auditor of SIL. h. The point raised in the CRISIL report was regarding the business risk since 90% of the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s revenues depended on the top 3 to 4 clients. There was nothing contained in the CRISIL report which suggested that there was any link between the Company, KMPs and/or the buyers.      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 8 of 36    i. As BRLM, the concentration was on bringing out the business risk factor regarding the issue (as indicated in  CRISIL report) and the same was addressed sufficiently in  the RHP and Prospectus, where the names of the top  buyers and their contribution to  the  revenue in  FY 2008-09 and FY 2009-10 at Page  no. 14  (Sl. No. 12)  along with  the associated business risks were provided  in detail. j. The   fact   that  Shalom  Fashion  and   Addon   Exports  were amongst  the   top  customers of  SIL  was   also  disclosed in  the  Offer document. It was also confirmed by SIL that the customers/sundry debtors including Shalom Fashion and Addon Exports were not directly or indirectly related to them. k. The  fact  that M/s. Shalom Fashion was  related to  Santosh  Ingle and  M/s. Addon  Exports was  related to Valliamal Murugan Thevar was  not  even  captured in  Related  Party  Transactions by the Statutory Auditors in the   Audited Financial Statements  which is publicly disclosed and  not  even  in  the  Restated Financials Statement  provided by the Independent Auditor. Therefore, there was no clue available that could have indicated us to delve deeper in this direction. l. The role of BRLM is neither investigative in nature nor in the nature of forensic audit. The due diligence process is guided by reasonability, and practically it is not possible to delve deeper in a matter unless there is any      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 9 of 36    suspicion. In  the  above  cases, there was nothing  on   record that  could   have   raised  any   suspicion that  M/s. Shalom Fashion  was   related  to  Santosh Ingle   and   M/s.  Addon Exports was related to Ms. Valliamal Murugan Thevar. m. There was no disclosure regarding Related Party Transactions of the Company with   Reena Nadar, Edwin   Joseph and Ramesh Andy Thevar and/or their proprietorships in Audited Financial Statements and Restated Financial Statements. Therefore, there was no reason for any suspicion that could have led us to look further in it. n. The Audited Financial Statements of FY 2005-06 to 30th September 2010 of  the  Statutory Auditors and  Restated Financial Statements  for  even  period   by  the   Independent  Auditor also did   not   include/ indicate any relation/transactions with the proprietorships of KMPs -   Reena E Nadar, Manager Accounts and Y Edwin Joseph, Manager Corporate Planning.  There  was  nothing  on   record  that  could  have   raised  any suspicion that the  above disclosures were  not  correct. o. There  were  no  standard  guidelines in place  for  the  due  diligence  process carried out   by Merchant Bankers for public  issues and   in  fact  the   need   of  the  same   was  felt  by  SEBI subsequent to this  IPO. The Association of Investment Bankers of India (AIBI) came out with Due Diligence Manual in August 2012, while the IPO process of SIL      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 10 of 36    concluded in February 2011 (18 months before). The manual with   respect to Related Party transactions  and   KMPs disclosure, provides that the  same  is to be relied  on the  confirmation of the Issuer Company and  Related  Party Transactions statement in the  financial statements, which was adequately done. p. Wherever there were doubts, steps were taken to examine the matter further and disclosures were made based on examination. The BRLM is not supposed to act like an investigating agency or conduct Forensic Audit.  4. Consideration of issues and findings \\\\\\\\u2013  Allegation No. 1 \\\\\\\\u2013 Non-disclosure of the role of the Independent director in key strategic and financial decisions 4.1. The DA in his Enquiry Report has stated that by virtue of clause 49 of equity listing agreement, relevant SEBI circular and ICDR Regulations, 2009, the merchant banker was required to verify the role of Deepak Shenoy as an independent director of SIL. It is alleged that no disclosure with regard to the same was made in the prospectus of SIL.  4.2. In this regard, the DA has noted that Deepak Shenoy, who was an independent director of SIL, was concurrently holding two positions i.e., an employee of FASIPL and as an independent director on the board of SIL. In this regard, it is      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 11 of 36    noted that Deepak Shenoy in his Statement dated November 30, 2015 made to SEBI has stated that he played a major role in the IPO of SIL. He has stated that:  Finaventure Advisory Services India Pvt. Ltd (now Virtuous Capital Ltd, hereinafter also referred to as FASIPL and/or VCL) used to provide consultancy to then M/s Sudar Garments Pvt Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSGPL\\\\\\\\u201d), for raising debts and he used to deal with SGPL as employee of Finaventure. As we were providing consultancy to SGPL for raising debts, we came out with the idea of raising funds for Sudar Garments Limited through an IPO. During January 2010 while being employee of FASPIL, I became independent director in SGL. Accordingly for the purpose of IPO, we started scouting for a Merchant Banker. FASPIL as consultant to Sudar held discussions with ACL and finalized it as BRLM.  4.3. This position was subsequently confirmed by the Managing Director of SIL in his statement dated November 06, 2015 as well as by certain customers/suppliers of SIL (some of whom were also employees of SIL). It was also observed from the Annual Report of SIL for the Financial Year 2010-11 that Deepak Shenoy along with Murugan M Thevar were signatories for and on behalf of the Board of Directors of SIL.  4.4. Further, with respect to role of one of the independent directors, the CRISIL grading report of the IPO of SIL stated that\\\\\\\\u2014  \\\\\\\\u201cOne of the independent directors is closely involved in business activities and plays a major role in guiding the promoter in taking business and financial decisions. We believe this will limit his      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 12 of 36    ability to act in the best interest of minority shareholders. Also, we believe the other independent directors have limited understanding of their roles and responsibilities. They are not adequately equipped to provide guidance and exercise oversight to ensure that the interests of minority shareholders are protected. In the past, the company has made unrelated financial investments which could have otherwise been invested in the operations of the company.\\\\\\\\u201d 4.5. In this regard, the Noticee in its reply has stated that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026.we were given to understand by Mr. Murugan Muthiah  Thevar   that since  he was educated till  Matriculate only,  it  was  difficult  for  him  to  understand document presentation. Moreover, he was not very much conversant with English language and was comfortable only in vernacular language.  Hence,   he   had   taken Deepak Shenoy for the   purpose of meeting with CRISIL/ other offices for more clarity on the issues. Further, Mr.  Murugan Muthiah Thevar   had confirmed that Deepak Shenoy had no role to play in the business and financial decisions of SIL, which were taken by CMD along with other Members of the BoDs.\\\\\\\\u201d 4.6.  Further the Noticee has stated that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026during the relevant time, there was no requirement of Independent Director as per Companies Act, 1956. Hence,  there   were  no  such   specific  guidelines under Companies Act,  1956  for  due  diligence  process on  Independent Directors\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d 4.7. It is obvious that Deepak Shenoy was concurrently holding two positions viz., one as an employee of FASIPL, which was acting as a financial consultant to SIL and other as an independent director of Sudar (to which the consultancy was being given). Therefore, from the above, it is apparent that the contention of the Noticee that \\\\\\\\u201cDeepak Shenoy had no role to play in the business and financial decisions of SIL, which      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 13 of 36    were taken by CMD along with other Members of the BoDs\\\\\\\\u201d, is devoid of any merit as Deepak Shenoy being the key person representing FASIPL on the one hand and concurrently being one of the Independent Directors of SIL, was playing a key role in the IPO of SIL. This indicates that the role of Deepak Shenoy as a consultant was in direct conflict with his role as an Independent Director.  4.8. With regard to Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s contention of no requirement of Independent Director as per Companies Act, 1956, it is observed that Annexure-I of SEBI circular no. SEBI/CFD/DIL/CG/1/2004/12/10 dated October 29, 2004, bearing the subject \\\\\\\\u201cCorporate Governance in listed Companies \\\\\\\\u2013 Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement\\\\\\\\u201d talks about composition of board and states that\\\\\\\\u2014 \\\\\\\\u201c(A) Composition of Board  i. The Board of directors of the company shall have an optimum combination of executive and non-executive directors with not less than fifty percent of the board of directors comprising of non-executive directors.  ii. Where the Chairman of the Board is a non-executive director, at least one-third of the Board should comprise of independent directors and in case he is an executive director, at least half of the Board should comprise of independent directors.  iii. For the purpose of the sub-clause (ii), the expression \\\\\\\\u2018independent director\\\\\\\\u2019 shall mean a non-executive director of the company who:      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 14 of 36    a. apart from receiving Director\\\\\\\\u2019s remuneration, does not have any material pecuniary relationships or transactions with the company, its promoters, its senior management or its holding company, its subsidiaries and associated companies; b. is not related to promoters or management at the Board level or at one level below the Board; c. has not been an executive of a company in the immediately preceding three financial years; d. is not a partner or an executive or was not a partner or an executive during the preceding three years, of any of the following:  i) the statutory audit firm or the internal audit firm that is associated with the company; and  ii) the legal firm (s) and consulting firm(s) that have a material association with the company; e. is not a material supplier, service provider or customer or lessor or lessee of the company, which may affect independence of the director; and f. is not a substantial shareholder of the company, i.e. owning two percent or more of the block of voting shares.\\\\\\\\u201d 4.9.  Further, Clause 7(a) (Corporate Governance) in Part A of Schedule VIII of SEBI ICDR Regulations, 2009 required that \\\\\\\\u201ca disclosure to the effect that the issuer has complied      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 15 of 36    with the requirements of Corporate Governance contained in the Equity Listing Agreement, particularly those relating to composition of board of directors, constitution of committees such as Audit Committee, Shareholder / Investor Grievance Committee, etc.\\\\\\\\u201d had to be made in the red herring prospectus, shelf prospectus and prospectus. 4.10. It is further noted that Schedule VI of ICDR Regulations, 2009 for regulations 8(1)(c), 10(3)(a), 106O(2) and 91E(5), in Form A specifies the format of Due Diligence certificate to be given by the merchant banker. Clause 2 (c) of the said form states that \\\\\\\\u201cOn the basis of such examination and the discussions with the issuer, its directors and other officers, other agencies, and independent verification of the statements concerning the objects of the issue, price justification and the contents of the documents and other papers furnished by the issuer (emphasis supplied), WE CONFIRM that:  (a)\\\\\\\\u2026 (c) the disclosures made in the draft red herring prospectus/draft prospectus/draft letter of offer are true, fair and adequate to enable the investors to make a well informed decision as to the investment in the proposed issue and such disclosures are in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act, 1956, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 and other applicable legal requirements.\\\\\\\\u201d 4.11. Thus, from the above, it is seen that an independent director is required to be a non-executive director of the company who, apart from receiving Director\\\\\\\\u2019s      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 16 of 36    remuneration, would not have any material pecuniary relationships or transactions with the company, its promoters, or its senior management. Deepak Shenoy while being an employee of FASIPL, which was providing consultancy to SIL as regards its IPO, was an Independent Director in SIL. There was, therefore, clearly a pecuniary relationship that existed. The CRISIL Report dated January 21, 2011, grading the proposed IPO, had also flagged the active role of the said Independent Director in the financial and strategic decisions of SIL. Also, it is seen from the above that a disclosure to the effect that the issuer has complied with the requirements of Corporate Governance contained in the Equity Listing Agreement, particularly those relating to composition of board of directors etc. is required to be made in the red herring prospectus, shelf prospectus and prospectus. Furthermore, the prescribed format of Due Diligence certificate states that the Merchant Banker has made \\\\\\\\u201cindependent verification\\\\\\\\u201d of the statements concerning the objects of the issue, price justification and the contents of the documents and other papers furnished by the issuer. Thus, from a conjoint reading of the above-mentioned provisions, it is clear that the Noticee was required to check compliance of corporate governance aspects of SIL, including the composition of the board of directors, and subject the information provided by the issuer company to independent verification. However, it is seen from the record that the Noticee has not ensured the disclosure of the role played by the Independent Director in the important financial and strategic decisions, in the offer documents.      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 17 of 36    4.12. Therefore, I concur with the DA that the merchant banker was under an obligation to verify the role of Deepak Shenoy as an independent director of SIL, in terms of Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement, read with the SEBI Circular dated October 29, 2004 and the provisions of the ICDR Regulations. Since, no disclosure with regard to the same was made in the prospectus of SIL, the Noticee Ashika Capital Ltd., was in violation of the provisions of ICDR Regulations.   Allegation No. 2- Heavy dependence of the Company on a few buyers and suppliers, and wrong disclosure with respect to the connection between those customers and suppliers and the Promoter/ Promoter Group of SIL  4.13. The DA in his findings in the enquiry report dated June 16, 2020 has stated that the merchant banker had failed to disclose the connection of the customers and suppliers with KMP of SIL. As such, the Noticee had failed to conduct a proper due diligence in this regard, which had led to the violation of SEBI ICDR and Merchant Banker Regulations. Also the heavy dependence of the Company on a few buyers and sellers has not been disclosed.  4.14. It has been brought out in the Enquiry Report that SIL has been highly dependent on its top three to four clients for around 80% of its revenues. The top three customers, accounting for around 70% and 80% of the turnover of the company for the financial year 2008-09 and 2009-10 respectively were: Shalom Fashion, Addon Exports and MTV Exports. These were proprietorship firms.      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 18 of 36    4.15. Investigation in the matter by SEBI has revealed that the said proprietorship firms were related to SIL in the following manner:  Table- 1 Customers Proprietor Relationship with the Company Addon Exports M Valliamal Thevar Wife of M Murugan Thevar, Chairman & Managing Director of SIL, and was also part of the Promoter group Shalom Fashion Santosh Ingle Had received 1,87,500 shares prior to the IPO and was the fourth largest shareholder of SIL on the date of filing of RHP of SIL. Return of Allotment form filed by SIL with MCA regarding issue of shares to Santosh Ingle in 2009, the address of Santosh Ingle was mentioned as Building no. 44, Flat no. 1552, Tilak Nagar, Chembur (East),      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 19 of 36    Mumbai, 400089, which is the same as the address of SIL as per its Memorandum and Articles of Association. Santosh Ingle was also the witness for Murugan M Thevar in the agreement for sale dated July 27, 2007 for purchase of land by SGL Pvt. Ltd. from one Nandlal T Gurnani.  4.16. Further, AR Fabrics, Elim Traders and RJ Traders were the Suppliers of the Company. These were also proprietorship firms. Investigation in the matter by SEBI has revealed that the said proprietorship firms were related to SIL in the following manner: Table-2 Supplier Proprietor Relationship with the Company AR Fabrics Ramesh Andy Thevar Brother \\\\\\\\u2013in-law of M Murugan Thevar, Chairman & Managing      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 20 of 36    Director of SIL. Also part of the promoter group of SIL. Elim Traders E Reena Nadar Manager Accounts of SIL, as mentioned in the RHP. RJ Traders Y Edwin Joseph Manager, Corporate planning of SIL (as mentioned in RHP)  4.17. The Noticee in this regard has submitted in its reply that\\\\\\\\u2014 \\\\\\\\uf0a7 There was nothing contained in the CRISIL report which suggested that there was any link between the Company, KMPs and/or the buyers. \\\\\\\\uf0a7 The Audited Financial Statements of FY 2005-06 to 30th September 2010 of the Statutory Auditors and Restated Financial Statements for even period by the Independent Auditor did not indicate any relation/transactions with the proprietorships of KMPs - Reena E Nadar, Manager Accounts and Y Edwin Joseph, Manager Corporate Planning. There  was  nothing  on   record  that  could  have   raised  any suspicion that the  above disclosures were  not  correct. 4.18. Page no. 15 of the prospectus of SIL details the major parties under Sundry Debtors. The Sundry Debtors also happen to be the major customers of the Company, namely Shalom Fashion, Addon Exports and MTV Exports. It is      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 21 of 36    further mentioned in the prospectus that the sundry debtors mentioned in the table on page no. 15, who are the major customers, were not in any way directly or indirectly connected with the Promoter or Promoter group. The disclosure in the prospectus to the effect that major customers are not in any way directly or indirectly connected with the Promoter or Promoter group presupposes that a minimum verification of the names of people who are the owners / proprietors of the companies, which fall in the list of top customers and suppliers of the issuer company, has been done.  Any merchant banker while conducting a due diligence is reasonably expected to examine the details and relationship of proprietors of the top customers and suppliers of the issuer company with the promoter/promoter group, before making any such disclosure in the prospectus. This duty to inquire and examine the role and relation between the suppliers and customers of SIL with the Promoter and Promoter Group becomes more important when the prospectus carries an explicit assertion that the major customers are not in any way directly or indirectly connected with the Promoter or Promoter group and backed up by a due diligence certificate to this effect issued by the merchant banker. 4.19. Facts such as\\\\\\\\u2014  M Valliamal Thevar, who was the wife of M Murugan Thevar, Chairman & Managing Director of SIL was also the proprietor of Addon Exports (which was one of the top customers of SIL); that Santosh Ingle, who was the fourth largest shareholder of SIL, was also the proprietor of Shalom Fashion (which was amongst top customers of SIL), were readily available on record and      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 22 of 36    could have been ascertained by an elementary due diligence and verification by the merchant banker. However, the merchant banker did not take any effort to find out the authenticity of facts disclosed by SIL to it. Further, facts such as R. Ramesh Andy Thevar, who was part of the promoter group of SIL was also the proprietor of AR Fabrics could have been easily ascertained. I find that the Noticee has  failed to exercise due diligence of a reasonable degree and a minimum level of prudence, as is normally expected of a Merchant Banker.   4.20. In this regard, it is noted that as per the Profit and Loss account of SIL for the year ended March 31, 2011, the top three creditors were as follows:  Table- 3 Sl. No. Name of the entity  Amount in Rs. crores 1 A R Fabrics  2.04 2 Elim Traders  5.02 3 R J Traders 5.04      Order in respect of Ashika Capital Limited  Page 23 of 36    From the above, it is reasonably expected that the merchant banker, whose sole duty is to authenticate and certify the facts to be disclosed in the prospectus, would attempt to find out the connection between the top creditors / suppliers of the company with its Promoter or Promoter group, especially when it is being asserted that the major customers are not in any way directly or indirectly connected with the Promoter or Promoter group. 4.21. The Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s contention that the audit report did not reveal the connection between the top creditors / suppliers of the company with its Promoter or Promoter group is not acceptable. It has been rightly noted by the DA that an audit report is a document containing the auditor\\\\\\\\u2019s opinion of whether a company\\\\\\\\u2019s financial statements comply with the generally accepted accounting principles. The Merchant Banker can rely on the audit report for the company\\\\\\\\u2019s financials and that does not obviate the Merchant Banker from carrying out an independent verification of the connection between the promoters and the suppliers/customers. Likewise, laying the blame on the Rating Reports of CRISIL and ICRA also does not support the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s conduct or its failure to do a proper due diligence before certification and making disclosures in the offer documents.     4.22. Therefore, I concur with the view of the DA that the disclosure in the offer documents that the customers and suppliers were not related to the promoter and promoter group was wrong and is in breach of the mandate contained in the ICDR Regulations and the Merchant Banker Regulations.

Settles Potential Civil Liability for Apparent Violations of the Iranian\\\\\\\\nTransactions and Sanctions Regulations\\\\\\\\nUniControl, Inc. (\\\\\\\\u201cUniControl\\\\\\\\u201d), a Cleveland, Ohio-based entity that manufactures process controls,\\\\\\\\nairflow pressure switches, boiler controls, and other instrumentation, has agreed to pay $216,464 to\\\\\\\\nsettle its potential civil liability for apparent violations of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions\\\\\\\\nRegulations (ITSR).  As a result of its failure to act on multiple apparent warning signs, UniControl\\\\\\\\nexported 19 shipments of its goods from the United States to two European companies with reason\\\\\\\\nto know that the goods were intended specifically for supply, transshipment, or reexportation to Iran\\\\\\\\nby the two European companies.  Additionally, UniControl had actual knowledge that an additional\\\\\\\\ntwo shipments would be reexported to Iran.  The settlement amount reflects OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s determination\\\\\\\\nthat UniControl\\\\\\\\u2019s apparent violations were non-egregious and voluntarily self-disclosed, and further\\\\\\\\nreflects the significant remedial measures implemented by UniControl upon discovery of the\\\\\\\\napparent violations.\\\\\\\\nDescription of the Conduct Leading to the Apparent Violations\\\\\\\\nFrom on or about July 16, 2013 to on or about March 25, 2017, UniControl appears to have\\\\\\\\nexported to two European companies 21 shipments of air pressure switches, valued at $687,189,\\\\\\\\nthat were subsequently reexported to Iran.  UniControl processed these transactions in its own name\\\\\\\\nand in the names of Hays Cleveland and Cleveland Controls Inc., two companies that are divisions\\\\\\\\nof UniControl.\\\\\\\\nThese apparent violations occurred in large part because UniControl failed to take appropriate steps\\\\\\\\nin response to multiple warning signs it encountered when engaging in business with its European\\\\\\\\ntrade partners, which gave UniControl reason to know its goods were being reexported to Iran.\\\\\\\\nThese warning signs included:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022\\\\\\\\nCustomer Interest in Iranian Market.  Early in their relationship, one of UniControl\\\\\\\\u2019s European\\\\\\\\ntrade partners told UniControl in May 2010 that it had a significant market for UniControl\\\\\\\\u2019s\\\\\\\\ngoods in Iran and inquired whether UniControl could serve as a supplier.  Although UniControl\\\\\\\\ninitially rebuffed the opportunity, UniControl never took steps in the subsequent years of the\\\\\\\\nbusiness relationship to ensure that sales to its European trade partner were not being reexported\\\\\\\\nto Iran.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022\\\\\\\\nInclusion of Iran in Authorized Sales Territory.  UniControl and a European trade partner\\\\\\\\nentered into a February 14, 2014 Sales Representative Agreement (SRA) that explicitly listed\\\\\\\\nIran as a country to which the European company could re-sell UniControl goods.  UniControl\\\\\\\\nnever sought to update or amend the SRA to make clear to its European trade partner that\\\\\\\\nreexports of its goods to Iran were impermissible.2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022\\\\\\\\nObfuscated End-User Request.  When a European trade partner informed UniControl of internal\\\\\\\\ncompany issues and holidays prompting necessary delays to UniControl shipping its switches to\\\\\\\\nthe European trade partner for onward shipment to end-users, UniControl offered on May 31,\\\\\\\\n2016 to ship its goods directly to a purported third-party European end-user in an effort to\\\\\\\\novercome the European trade partner\\\\\\\\u2019s substantial delays and ensure the end-user did not source\\\\\\\\ntheir goods elsewhere.  The European trade partner rebuffed this offer, citing problems with\\\\\\\\ndocumentation and transportation issues.  UniControl did not question or follow up on this\\\\\\\\nobfuscation nor otherwise try to engage directly with the ostensible end-user of its goods.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022\\\\\\\\nEngagement with Iranian Nationals at European Trade Shows.  UniControl management and\\\\\\\\nemployees attended European trade conferences in 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2017 at which they\\\\\\\\nassisted visitors at UniControl\\\\\\\\u2019s distributors\\\\\\\\u2019 booths to understand UniControl products.  In this\\\\\\\\ncontext, UniControl managers met with Iranian nationals in March 2016 at a European trade\\\\\\\\npartner\\\\\\\\u2019s booth, but did not question its European trade partner about the Iranian interest in\\\\\\\\nUniControl products.  UniControl also met one-on-one with an Iranian end-user and a European\\\\\\\\ntrade partner at the March 2017 trade conference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022\\\\\\\\nRequest to Remove \\\\\\\\u201cMade in USA\\\\\\\\u201d Label.  UniControl\\\\\\\\u2019s European trade partner requested in a\\\\\\\\nFebruary 23, 2017 email that UniControl remove its \\\\\\\\u201cMade in USA\\\\\\\\u201d label from the switches\\\\\\\\nslated for exportation to the European trade partner.  The European trade partner explained that\\\\\\\\nthe Iranian end-user may have problems with the stated origin of the products.  The request\\\\\\\\nraised questions within UniControl\\\\\\\\u2014and prompted the company to seek follow-up guidance\\\\\\\\nfrom outside counsel in March 2017\\\\\\\\u2014but UniControl nonetheless sent two subsequent\\\\\\\\nshipments to the European trade partner for reexport to Iran.\\\\\\\\nFollowing consultation with outside counsel, UniControl voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent\\\\\\\\nviolations to OFAC and acknowledged to OFAC that it had actual knowledge that the final two of\\\\\\\\nthe 21 transactions were intended specifically for reexport to Iran by its European trade partners.\\\\\\\\nOne European trade partner returned the goods to UniControl and was reimbursed for its earlier\\\\\\\\npayment, while the other disregarded UniControl\\\\\\\\u2019s request and reexported the goods it received\\\\\\\\nfrom UniControl to Iran.\\\\\\\\nAccordingly, UniControl\\\\\\\\u2019s conduct resulted in apparent violations of 31 C.F.R. part 560 of the\\\\\\\\nITSR.  Specifically, between the approximate dates of July 16, 2013 and March 25, 2017,\\\\\\\\nUniControl appears to have violated \\\\\\\\xa7 560.204 of the ITSR, when it exported goods from the\\\\\\\\nUnited States to a third country with knowledge or reason to know that the goods were intended\\\\\\\\nspecifically for supply, transshipment, or reexportation to Iran.  In total, UniControl engaged in 21\\\\\\\\nprohibited transactions valued at $687,189.\\\\\\\\nPenalty Calculations and General Factors Analysis\\\\\\\\nThe statutory maximum civil monetary penalty amount for the apparent violations in this matter is\\\\\\\\n$5,423,766.  However, OFAC determined that UniControl voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent\\\\\\\\nviolations and that the apparent violations constitute a non-egregious case.  Accordingly, under\\\\\\\\nOFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R. part 501, app. A., the base civil3\\\\\\\\nmonetary penalty amount for the apparent violations equals the sum of one-half of the transaction\\\\\\\\nvalue for each apparent violation, which in this case is $343,595.\\\\\\\\nThe settlement amount of $216,464 reflects OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s consideration of the General Factors under the\\\\\\\\nEnforcement Guidelines.\\\\\\\\nOFAC determined the following to be aggravating factors:\\\\\\\\n(1) With respect to the initial 19 shipments, UniControl failed to follow up on multiple warning\\\\\\\\nsigns that its European trade partner was reexporting its goods to Iran.\\\\\\\\n(2) With respect to the initial 19 shipments, UniControl senior leadership was aware or should\\\\\\\\nhave been aware of the reexportation of its goods to Iran.\\\\\\\\n(3) With respect to its two final shipments, UniControl exported its air pressure switches from\\\\\\\\nthe United States to two European companies with actual knowledge that these goods were\\\\\\\\nto be reexported to an end-user located in Iran.\\\\\\\\n(4) When exporting the final two shipments, UniControl\\\\\\\\u2019s senior leadership, including its\\\\\\\\nPresident, Quality Assurance Supervisor, and Sales Engineer, had actual knowledge that the\\\\\\\\ncompany\\\\\\\\u2019s goods were to be reexported to an Iranian end-user.\\\\\\\\nOFAC found the following to be mitigating factors:\\\\\\\\n(1) UniControl is a modest-sized company with no prior sanctions history with OFAC,\\\\\\\\nincluding no receipt of a penalty notice or Finding of Violation in the five years preceding\\\\\\\\nthe earliest date of the apparent violations.\\\\\\\\n(2) UniControl ceased all shipments to its European trade partners at the time of its disclosure.\\\\\\\\nWith regard to the final two shipments that UniControl had actual knowledge were intended\\\\\\\\nfor reexport to Iran, UniControl requested that both trade partners return the goods to\\\\\\\\nUniControl.  One European trade partner complied, and UniControl reimbursed that\\\\\\\\ncompany its payment.  The other trade partner rebuffed UniControl\\\\\\\\u2019s request and reexported\\\\\\\\nthe switches to Iran.  UniControl asserted that it forfeited approximately $66,900 in payment\\\\\\\\nfor those switches that were reexported rather than accept funds involving an Iranian end\\\\\\\\ncustomer.\\\\\\\\n(3) UniControl cooperated with OFAC during the course of its investigation by submitting\\\\\\\\ndetailed and well-documented correspondence describing the apparent violations, as well as\\\\\\\\nentered into two tolling agreements with OFAC.\\\\\\\\n(4) UniControl invested in and strengthened its trade compliance procedures, including by:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 Hiring outside counsel to assist in strengthening its sanctions compliance and export\\\\\\\\npolicies and procedures;4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 Requiring customers sign end-user and end-use certificates to ensure that buyers do not\\\\\\\\nresell UniControl products to prohibited end-users;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 Where UniControl customers are reexporting UniControl products, UniControl is now\\\\\\\\nrequiring end-user certificates from secondary and tertiary buyers of reexported\\\\\\\\nproducts; and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 Adding a Destination Control Statement to the footer of certain trade documents,\\\\\\\\nincluding: internal sales orders, accounting forms, customer-order acknowledgements,\\\\\\\\nand customer invoices, to remind recipients of the restrictions on reselling, transferring,\\\\\\\\nmanipulating or otherwise disposing of their products.\\\\\\\\nCompliance Considerations\\\\\\\\nThis enforcement action highlights the importance of identifying and assessing multiple warning\\\\\\\\nsigns that indicate a foreign trade partner may be re-exporting goods to a sanctioned jurisdiction.  In\\\\\\\\nthis case, the multiple indicia of sanctions risks should have prompted a commensurate compliance\\\\\\\\nresponse.  In particular, U.S. businesses should seek transparency when dealing with foreign trade\\\\\\\\npartners and follow up on activities that raise concerns or suspicion.  For example, should a foreign\\\\\\\\ntrade partner indicate an interest in reexporting goods to a sanctioned jurisdiction, a U.S. business\\\\\\\\nshould actively communicate with the partner about relevant trade restrictions, review relevant trade\\\\\\\\ndocuments, and conduct other risk-based due diligence to ensure that the trade partner understands\\\\\\\\nthe relevant prohibitions and does not engage in violative activity.\\\\\\\\nOFAC Enforcement and Compliance Resources\\\\\\\\nOn May 2, 2019, OFAC published A Framework for OFAC Compliance Commitments in order to\\\\\\\\nprovide organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction, as well as foreign entities that conduct business in\\\\\\\\nor with the United States or U.S. persons, or that use U.S.-origin goods or services, with OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s\\\\\\\\nperspective on the essential components of a sanctions compliance program.  The Framework also\\\\\\\\noutlines how OFAC may incorporate these components into its evaluation of apparent violations\\\\\\\\nand resolution of investigations resulting in settlements.  The Framework includes an appendix that\\\\\\\\noffers a brief analysis of some of the root causes of apparent violations of U.S. economic and trade\\\\\\\\nsanctions programs OFAC has identified during its investigative process.\\\\\\\\nInformation concerning the civil penalties process can be found in the OFAC regulations governing\\\\\\\\neach sanctions program; the Reporting, Procedures, and Penalties Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 501;\\\\\\\\nand the Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R. part 501, app. A.

Commission (SFC) has reprimanded and fined Sino-Rich Securities &amp; Futures Limited (Sino-Rich) $7.2 million for failures in complying with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regatory requirements when handling cash deposits and third party fund transfers (Note 1).\\\\\\\\nThe SFC's investigation found that between April 2015 and October 2017 (Relevant Period), Sino-Rich had routinely processed:\\\\\\\\n238 cash deposits, with an aggregate amount of over $30 million; and\\\\\\\\n269 third party transfers, with an aggregate amount of over $900 million.\\\\\\\\nFor cash deposits, there is no record of any enquires made by Sino-Rich's staff with the clients and approvals by its responsible officers (ROs) prior to January 2017.&nbsp; It was only after the SFC issued a management letter to Sino-Rich in November 2016 that Sino-Rich required its staff to record the reasons and the ROs' approval for cash deposits.\\\\\\\\nWith respect to third party transfers, Sino-Rich's staff were required to fill in the relevant third party transfer forms but important information such as the client's relationship with the third party, the reason for the transfer and/or the client's signature was not provided in around 40% of the forms.&nbsp; The SFC also found that there were numerous occasions where the relationships or reasons stated do not include sufficient particars to explain why the relevant clients had to use their securities/futures accounts at Sino-Rich to receive or route funds from/to third parties.\\\\\\\\nThere is no record that Sino-Rich had rejected any requests for cash deposits and third party transfers or made any reports to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (JFIU) during the Relevant Period.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the SFC found that a substantial number of cash deposits and third party transfers processed or approved by Sino-Rich raised a number of red flags that warranted further inquiries or report to the JFIU.&nbsp; For example:\\\\\\\\n38 cash deposits with an aggregate amount of $3 million were made to a client's account within&nbsp;eight days and the said sum exceeded the client's liquid assets and annual net profit declared in its account opening documents;\\\\\\\\n12 cash deposits with an aggregate amount of $1 million were made to a client's account within a day and then the entire amount was transferred to an account of another broker on the same day; and\\\\\\\\nSino-Rich approved a client's request for third party transfer on the basis that such transfer was made to his business partner, even though the account opening documents recorded that the client was a fl-time investor.\\\\\\\\nThe SFC is of the view that Sino-Rich's conduct was in breach of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (April 2015 &ndash; February 2018 edition), the Code of Conduct and the Internal Control Guidelines (Notes 2 to 4).\\\\\\\\nIn deciding the disciplinary sanctions against Sino-Rich, the SFC took into account that:\\\\\\\\nSino-Rich's failures lasted for more than two years involving over $930 million;\\\\\\\\nit is important for licensed corporations to have in place adequate and effective internal control systems to mitigate the risk of money laundering and/or terrorist financing;\\\\\\\\nSino-Rich cooperated with the SFC to resolve the SFC's regatory concerns;\\\\\\\\nin resolving the SFC's regatory concerns, Sino-Rich agreed to engage an independent reviewer to review its internal controls; and\\\\\\\\nSino-Rich has no previous disciplinary record with the SFC.\\\\\\\\nEnd\\\\\\\\nNotes:\\\\\\\\nSino-Rich is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on business in Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts), Type 4 (advising on securities), Type 5 (advising on futures contracts) and Type 9

Network 18 Media and Investments Ltd. (hereinafter referred as \\\\\\\\u201cNW18\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cthe Company\\\\\\\\u201d) is a company having its securities listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cBSE\\\\\\\\u201d) and National Stock Exchange Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cNSE\\\\\\\\u201d). Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) received a complaint dated March 12, 2017 against the Company, wherein it was alleged that the Company has failed to disclose Independent Media Trust (IMT) as a \\\\\\\\u2018promoter\\\\\\\\u2019 in its Draft Letter of Offer (\\\\\\\\u201cDLO\\\\\\\\u201d) dated March 01, 2012 and its Letter of Offer (\\\\\\\\u201cLoO\\\\\\\\u201d) dated August 31, 2012.  2. SEBI observed that the Company made a right issue in year 2012, wherein DLO was dated March 01, 2012 and LoO was dated August 31, 2012. The promoter of the Company namely, Mr. Raghav Bahl disclosed that the Company had entered into an arrangement with IMT, a trust set up for the benefit of Reliance Industries Limited, to secure funding required for this purpose.  3. In another matter of the Company pertaining to same entities on separate allegations, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (\\\\\\\\u2018SAT\\\\\\\\u2019) vide its order dated April 13, 2016 directed SEBI to reinvestigate whether IMT, in the guise of executing Zero Coupon Optionally and Fully Convertible Debentures (\\\\\\\\u2018ZOCD\\\\\\\\u2019) agreement dated February 27, 2012 had indirectly acquired joint control over the Company without following the procedures prescribed under SEBI (Substantial Acquisitions of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SAST Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019).  4. Accordingly, SEBI investigated the said matter and observed as follows: -   a. ZOCD agreement was entered into by IMT to provide funds to the holdings companies of NW18 to enable them to subscribe to the right issue of NW18 and its subsidiary TV18.______________________________________________________________________________________ Settlement Order in the matter of Network 18 Media and Investments Ltd.             Page 2 of 4  b. As on the date of execution of ZOCD, IMT had only one trustee viz. Nilrab Media Private Limited (NMPL) which is jointly owned by the promoters of NW18 viz. Mr. Raghav Bahl and Ms. Ritu Kapur. Accordingly, IMT was ultimately under the control of Mr. Raghav Bahl, thus, under the control of NW18. 5. In view of aforesaid investigation observations, SEBI inter alia observed that - IMT had indirectly acquired joint control over NW18 not by way of said ZOCD Agreement, but even before that by way of Single Unit Agreement (\\\\\\\\u2018SUA\\\\\\\\u2019) dated November 23, 2011, whereby IMT along with the holding companies of NW18 and the promoters of NW18 had agreed to act as \\\\\\\\u2018Single Unit\\\\\\\\u2019 in managing the matters of NW18 and acquired the right to appoint the majority of the board of directors of NW18. 6. In view of above, it is observed that IMT and the promoter entities of the Company entered into the SUA with the common objective of owning and controlling at least51% equity share capital of the Company by agreeing to act as a single unit in managing the matters of the Company and jointly having the right to appoint majority of the Board of Directors of the Company. Therefore, IMT qualified to be a Person Acting in Concert (PAC) with the promoter entities of the Company in terms of Regulation 2(1)(q)(1) of the SAST Regulations pursuant to entering into said SUA. Further, as DCPL, the trustee of IMT, was wholly owned by Mr. Raghav Bahl and his wife Ms. Ritu Kapur, who were the promoters of the Company, IMT qualified to be included in the promoter group of the Company as per ICDR Regulations. Thus, the aforesaid information i.e. IMT being a part of the promoter group, was required to be disclosed, under the promoter category by the Company in its DLO and LoO. 7. As, the Company had not disclosed IMT as part of promoter group of the Company in its DLO dated March01, 2012 and LoO dated August 31, 2012, it is alleged that the Company has violated the provisions of Regulation 57(1) of the ICDR Regulations and Clauses 5(VI)(C)(4),(5) and(6)of Part E of Schedule VIII read with Regulation 57(2)(b) of the ICDR Regulations. 8. Accordingly, in terms of Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules read with section 15I of the SEBI Act, the notice to show cause no. EAD-2/AP/AKS/OW/2870/2020 dated January 22, 2020 (hereinafter referred as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee, calling upon it to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against it in terms of Rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules and penalty be not imposed under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act for the aforesaid alleged violations of the ICDR Regulations. 9. Vide letter dated February 19, 2020, the legal representative viz. AZB & Partners on behalf of the Noticee requested for 2 weeks\\\\\\\\u2019 time from the date of letter to submit reply to the SCN. Thereafter, several extensions on ground of pandemic situation were sought by the Noticee. However, no reply to the SCN was received from the Noticee.

Accordingly, a confirmation was sought from Settlement Division with respect to the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s aforesaid submission. Vide e-mail dated August 03, 2020 the Settlement Division confirmed the receipt of Settlement Application from the Noticee.   11. After attending meeting with the Internal Committee of SEBI on September 25, 2020, in terms of the Settlement Regulations, the Noticees vide letter dated October 05, 2020, proposed the revised settlement terms. The High Powered Advisory Committee (\\\\\\\\u2018HPAC\\\\\\\\u2019) in its meeting held on December 30, 2020, considered the settlement terms proposed and recommended the case for settlement upon payment of \\\\\\\\u20b91,55,87,500/- (Rupees One Crore Fifty-Five Lakh Eighty-Seven Thousand and Five Hundred only) towards settlement charges.  12. The Panel of Whole Time Members of SEBI approved the said recommendation of the HPAC on January 11, 2021. Thereafter, the demand notice was issued to the Noticee on January 22, 2021, however, the Noticee informed that same was not received by him. Accordingly, the demand notice was re-issued to the Noticee on March 04, 2021 and vide email dated March 09, 2021, the Noticee confirmed the payment of \\\\\\\\u20b91,55,87,500/- (Rupees One Crore Fifty-Five Lakh Eighty-Seven Thousand and Five Hundred only) towards the settlement charges. The concerned department of SEBI vide email dated March 10, 2021 has confirmed the receiving of the penalty amount.  13. Therefore, in view of the acceptance of the settlement terms and receipt of penalty amount as above by SEBI, the instant adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee vide SCN dated January 22, 2020 are disposed of in terms of section 15JB of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulation 23(1) of the Settlement Regulations on the basis of the settlement terms.  14.

As per the provisions of the Enhanced supervision circular dated September 26, 2016, the Principal G, as referred in the Table-1 i.e. the total available funds i.e. cash and cash equivalents with the stock broker and with the clearing        Adjudication Order in respect of Swastika Commodities Private Limited                Page 4 of 39  corporation/clearing member (points A + B in the Table-1) should always be equal to or greater than Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds as per ledger balance (point C in the Table-1). If G is negative, it implies that the total available fund is less than the ledger credit balance of clients. The value of G indicates utilization of clients' funds for other purposes i.e. funds of credit balance clients are being utilized either for settlement obligations of debit balance clients or for the stock brokers' own purposes.   iii. Based on the findings of inspection and analysis given in the Table-1 above, it was observed that on twelve instances out of 19 sample dates, the value of G was negative. Therefore, it is alleged that on twelve instances, the Noticee had mis-utilised credit balance client funds\\\\\\\\u2019 for the purpose of debit balance clients\\\\\\\\u2019 and for own purposes in the range of Rs 16.78 lakh to Rs. 1.92 crore, which is in violation of the following provisions: a. Section 23D of SCRA read with SEBI Circular SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993. b. Clause 3 of annexure of Enhanced supervision circular.   B. Non-segregation of Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds  iv. As per the provisions of SEBI Circular SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Transactions Regulation Circular\\\\\\\\u2019), it shall be compulsory for all Member brokers to keep the money of the clients in a separate account and their own money in a separate account. Wherever the Member broker is taking a position as a principal, no payment for transactions will be allowed to be made from the client\\\\\\\\u2019s account.   v. During the inspection, analysis was done w.r.t the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s segregation of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds and securities. In this regard, it was observed that the broker had transferred Rs. 2.15 crore from client account to own account and created a fixed deposit for the same amount in his own account. The said transfer was observed to have been done not due to liability of clients to the broker, but for reason other than specified purposes. Since the broker failed to segregate client funds, it is alleged that the Noticee violated the following provisions: a. Section 23D of SCRA read with Clause 1 of Transactions Regulation Circular  b. Clause 2.4.2 of annexure of Enhanced supervision circular        Adjudication Order in respect of Swastika Commodities Private Limited                Page 5 of 39   vi. As per Clause 2.4.2 of Enhanced Supervision Circular, a broker has to maintain daily reconciliation statement clearly indicating the amount of funds transferred between clients and own account as specified in in the aforesaid clause of the Enhanced Supervision Circular. However, it was observed that there was no reconciliation of client and own funds done by the broker on a daily basis. Therefore, it is alleged that the Noticee violated the following provisions: a. Section 23D of SCRA read with Clause 1 of Transactions Regulation Circular  b. Clause 2.4.2 of annexure of Enhanced supervision circular  C. Non settlement of Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds  vii. It was observed that the Noticee had not settled accounts of 425 clients, on a quarterly /monthly basis as per their preferences. There were 542 instances of such non-settlement of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 accounts during the Inspection Period on.The amount of non-settlement ranged from Rs. 1.32 crore (for the quarter ended June-2018) to Rs.7.93 crore (for the quarter ended September 2018).   Therefore, on account of such non-settlement of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds and securities, it is alleged that the Noticee violated the following:  a. SEBI circular SEBI/MIRSD/SE/Cir-19/2009 dated December 03, 2009 b. Clause 8.1 of Annexure of Enhanced supervision circular.  viii. It was further observed that the Noticee had not issued retention statements to the clients for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017. Therefore, it is alleged that the Noticee has  violated the Clause 12-(e) of Annexure-A of SEBI circular SEBI/MIRSD/SE/Cir-19/2009 dated December 03, 2009 read with para 4 of Annexure to NSE circular no. NSE/INSP/36889 dated February 02, 2018.  ix. It was observed that the retention statements sent to the clients show that the margin obligation of clients had been retained at 325%. As per SEBI Circular SEBI/MIRSD/SE/Cir-19/2009 dated December 03, 2009 read with para 4 of Annexure to SE circular no. NSE/INSP/36889 dated February 02, 2018, Member may retain 225% of the margin obligation. Therefore, by retaining margin in excess of applicable amount, it is alleged that the Noticee has  violated the Clause 12-(e) of Annexure-A of SEBI circular SEBI/MIRSD/SE/Cir-19/2009 dated December 03,        Adjudication Order in respect of Swastika Commodities Private Limited                Page 6 of 39  2009 read with para 4 of Annexure to NSE circular no. NSE/INSP/36889 dated February 02, 2018.  D. Discrepancies in KYC and KRA Process  x. During the inspection, it was ascertained whether the Noticee has adhered to the law governing Account opening process, Know Your Client (KYC) requirements, KYC Registration Agency (KRA) and Central KYC Records Registry (CKYCR) process, Unique Client Code (UCC) and mapping of email ids, mobile numbers, etc. The details of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Email id and mobile numbers uploaded by the Noticee in the Unique Client Code (UCC) database of the Exchange were also checked with the details available in the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s back office to verify whether both records were the same. It was also checked whether single email id and mobile number were mapped to multiple clients. Further, it was also checked whether email ids and mobile numbers of all active clients were uploaded in the platforms of MCX/NCDEX.    xi. In this regard, the following observations were made therein:  i. 205 email ids were mapped to 432 clients i.e. to multiple clients.  ii. Single mobile number were mapped to multiple clients i.e. 199 mobile numbers mapped to 420 clients i.e. to multiple clients.  iii. The mobile numbers and email ids of the clients uploaded in the UCC database were found to be different from those maintained in the back office records of the Noticee. There were 369 instances for email id mismatch and 249 instances of mobile number mismatches.   xii. In view of the above, it is alleged that the Noticee has violated Clause 2(B) of SEBI Circular No. CIR/MIRSD/15/2011 dated August 02, 2011.        Adjudication Order in respect of Swastika Commodities Private Limited                Page 7 of 39  E. Analysis of Enhanced Supervision data  xiii. As per the Enhanced Supervision circular, stock brokers had to inform the Stock Exchanges of existing and new bank accounts. During the course of inspection of inspection, it was observed that Noticee had not reported the following bank accounts to MCX/NCDEX :-  Name of Bank Account Number Purpose of Account (Own / Client / Settlement) Indusind Bank 201001053693 Settlement  Indusind Bank 201001053686 Exchange Dues Indusind Bank 201001053488 Own Indusind Bank 201001037877 Client  xiv. Therefore, it is alleged that Noticee has violated Clause 2.1 of Annexure to SEBI Enhanced Supervision circular.  6. The SCN issued to the Noticee was sent through Speed Post AD and through email dated January 15, 2021. From the material available on record, I note that the SCN was delivered to the Noticee. The Noticee submitted its reply to the SCN vide email dated February 1, 2021.  7. An opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on February 09, 2021, vide hearing notice dated February 01, 2021. During the hearing, the Authorized Representative (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018AR\\\\\\\\u2019) reiterated the submissions made by them vide letter dated February 01, 2021. Further, the Noticee sought seven days\\\\\\\\u2019 time to make additional submissions. Additional submissions were made by the Noticee vide email dated February 16, 2021.     8. The submissions made by the Noticee in its replies dated February 01, 2021 and February 16, 2021 are summarized below:        Adjudication Order in respect of Swastika Commodities Private Limited                Page 8 of 39   I. Reply of Noticee dated February 01, 2021:  A. Misuse of Client\\\\\\\\u2019s Funds  i. \\\\\\\\u201cWe never used clients fund for our own purpose. We always ensure the availability of sufficient funds against the client payables and maintain our principle \\\\\\\\u201cG\\\\\\\\u201d positive on day to day basis. As per the requirement of inspection team, we have submitted them the report on calculation of principle \\\\\\\\u201cG\\\\\\\\u201d for the month of February, 2018 on day to day basis.   ii. The observation pointed out by the inspection team that on 12 dates out of 19 sample dates, broker has used funds of credit balance clients  for own purpose or for debit balance clients.   iii. In this regard we want to submit that we have never used funds of credit balance clients for our own purpose as we did not have any proprietary trading and neither had we used these funds for the clients having debit balance as we have sufficient line credits available with us. At initial phase of introduction of this mechanism the stock broker is supposed to submit the data for the calculation of Principle \\\\\\\\u201cG\\\\\\\\u201d, as on last trading day of every month to the stock Exchanges. This monthly reporting mechanism was in place till 31.03.2018 which has been clarified via circular no. CIR/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2017/64 dated 22nd June, 2017. Thereafter, the same have to be to be submitted on weekly basis from 01.04.2018.   iv. We always have sufficient line of credit which was available and intact in our own account by the source of overdraft facility availed by us because earlier we use to create FD against Client Margin obligation from our Own account. The only thing was that the amount intact in our own account was shifted to client account on the last day of every month in order to fulfill the requirement of reporting the criteria of Principle \\\\\\\\u201cG\\\\\\\\u201d. This mechanism was followed by us in compliance of the monthly reporting criteria as mentioned in above stated circular.   v. And because of the above mentioned reason these 12 instances reported by the inspection team occurred, as they verified it on day to day basis and the sample        Adjudication Order in respect of Swastika Commodities Private Limited                Page 9 of 39  dates selected by them was of during the period when monthly reporting mechanism was in place. And they clarified that it is supposed to be maintained on daily basis. This was explained to inspection team during the time of inspection also that as per the circular provisions the reporting criteria was to be done on the last working day of the month and therefore the funds availed through the overdraft facility was remain intact in the own account on day to day basis and the same was transferred in client account only on the last trading day of the month, in order to fulfill the reporting criteria of Principle \\\\\\\\u201cG\\\\\\\\u201d. The same is intact in own account because of the reason as mentioned above that earlier we used  to create FD against client margin obligation from our own account and then we transfer the funds from clients account to own account.  vi. Further, we also bring to your notice that the inspection team made the calculation by considering funds available in client account only while calculating the figures for Principle \\\\\\\\u201cG\\\\\\\\u201d.  In this calculation they didn\\\\\\\\u2019t considered the funds available in settlement account and other accounts. And because of this reason only these observation have been occurred.   vii. On the contrary if the inspection team would have considered funds available in settlement account and other accounts on every date of instances notified as above then, there would not have been any deficiency reported.   viii. The availability of sufficient line of credit with us can also be verified as from 1st April, 2018 when instead of monthly, weekly reporting mechanism came into effect and in order to fulfill the criteria of principle G on daily basis we started transferring the funds intact in our own account for the purpose of creating the FD in favour of clearing corporation against client margin obligation, on day to day basis. This could only be possible as we have the availability of sufficient line of credit with us and the creditor\\\\\\\\u2019s funds are never being mis-utilized. And we never report our principle \\\\\\\\u201cG\\\\\\\\u201d as negative.\\\\\\\\u201d        Adjudication Order in respect of Swastika Commodities Private Limited                Page 10 of 39   B. Non \\\\\\\\u2013 Segregation of Client\\\\\\\\u2019s fund  i. Transfer of funds from client\\\\\\\\u2019s account to own account  i.  \\\\\\\\u201cWe are having proper system to maintain segregation of client funds from own funds. For the segregation of client funds we always follow all the relevant applicable norms and provisions of SEBI and exchanges. As per the applicable provisions for segregation of client funds, we maintain the client fund in client bank accounts or with exchanges and did not use the client bank account for any purpose other than specified and have not drawn any money from the clients account other than the specified purpose required for payment to or on behalf of clients or for or towards payment of debt towards us from clients.   ii. The observation that have been mentioned by the inspection team that the broker had transferred Rs. 2.15 Crore from client account to own account and created a fixed deposit for the same amount in his own account.  iii. In this regard we want to convey that as per the provisions, we have created the FD in favor of Clearing Corporation in order to fulfill the margin obligations outstanding in account of the client and thereafter the funds has been transferred from the client account to the own account of the trading member in respect of the payment of debt towards us from the clients. Further, we also want to draw your kind attention on the fact that the FD did not kept in own account it was kept in favour of clearing corporation against the clients margin obligation.   iv. Therefore, these transaction that have been observed by the inspection team between own and client account is done for the legitimate purpose only as specified by SEBI i.e. against the margin obligation of clients.   v. Hence, there is no mis- utilization of client\\\\\\\\u2019s funds and nor any amount transferred from client account to own account for reason other than specified purpose.\\\\\\\\u201d        Adjudication Order in respect of Swastika Commodities Private Limited                Page 11 of 39   ii. Non \\\\\\\\u2013 reconciliation of daily reconciliation statement   \\\\\\\\u201cWe have the system of monitoring the funds of client and own account on daily basis and do reconcile the same. As on that basis only we are able to submit the weekly enhance report effectively and on timely basis. Only the thing was that before and during the inspection the same has not been documented in a specified format. Therefore, we couldn\\\\\\\\u2019t able to produce the proper/systematic reconciliation on daily basis to inspection team. But after inspection we have started documenting the reconciliation of client and own funds in proper format on daily basis as per the suggestion of inspection team.\\\\\\\\u201d  C. Non- settlement of Client\\\\\\\\u2019s funds  i. Non-settlement of client\\\\\\\\u2019s account  i. \\\\\\\\u201cWe are following proper actual settlement system as per the provisions of SEBI and exchange and always make sure that no account remains unsettled.   ii. We are having the system of running account Settlements for our clients and as per their preferences the accounts have been settled on Quarterly/Monthly basis and we do follow the circular/norms of exchange and SEBI to settle the clients. But still there were some codes which were unsettled during the time of inspection and the reason for unsettlement was only that either they are not traceable or their bank details are not updated. Only those clients account were not settled during the time of inspection. We continuously approached the clients which were not traceable or whose Bank details were not updated by sending mails or letter to them in order to update bank details and as and when the same get updated we have settled the client\\\\\\\\u2019s accounts.      iii. The clarification for the observation that have been pointed out by the inspection team in relation to settlement of account are here as under:   \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Out of 526 instances of non \\\\\\\\u2013 settlement that have been submitted by us at the time of inspection, 240 instances are those, on which settlement        Adjudication Order in respect of Swastika Commodities Private Limited                Page 12 of 39  provisions are not applicable as these accounts are opened in the same quarter and as per settlement provisions \\\\\\\\u201cIn case of new clients, no settlement would be required in the month/quarter in which funds/securities are received by the Member for the first time\\\\\\\\u201d.   \\\\\\\\uf0d8 All the remaining 286 instances of unsettled accounts submitted by us during the time of inspection have been settled now. And the reason for the delay in settlement was only that either the client was not traceable or their bank details were not updated.    \\\\\\\\uf0d8  The inspection team mentioned that 16 unsettled client accounts that were traced by them during their sample verification were not reflecting in the unsettled accounts list submitted by us. In this regard we want to mention that some account which has not been reflecting in our unsettled account list submitted to inspection team. The reasons for the same are here as under:  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 There was some technical glitch in our old back office due to which some accounts were reflected in settled criteria although the same were unsettled. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In some cases we have issued to client,  cheque for payout but the same was not presented by client and expired after 3 months therefore the client remains unsettled in that particular quarter. But the same settled in the next quarter.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In few cases there was gap of more than 95 days i.e. and there is a slight difference of 3 to 5 days. Therefore, we considered the same as settled but the inspection team did not considered the same.\\\\\\\\u201d  ii. Non-issuance of retention statement:  i. \\\\\\\\u201cWe have the system of running account settlement for our clients and as per their preferences the accounts have been settled on Quarterly/Monthly basis and we do follow the circular/norms of SEBI and exchange to settle the clients. During the quarter ended 30th June, 2017 and 30th September, 2017 we have properly settled the clients account and sent the retention statement as well.        Adjudication Order in respect of Swastika Commodities Private Limited                Page 13 of 39   ii. But due to technical reasons in our old back office the logs for sending the Retention statement for the period has not been generated and therefore we couldn\\\\\\\\u2019t able to produce any records or logs for the same to the inspection team. We were having a proper system of sending retention statement to each and every client, as the same can be viewed that the inspection team didn\\\\\\\\u2019t find this discrepancy in the later quarters, because the logs for those quarters have been produced to them.  iii. The logs for these quarters were not available as due to the technical bugs in our old back office software, thereafter we switched to new back office software in October, 2017 and since then proper logs generated and the same produced to inspection team for verification.   iv. This observation has been occurred only due to technical error in our network and old back office and there was no other reason for the same.   v. As we always maintain transparency while dealing with our clients and timely provide them all the information. And there is not even a single complain from our clients in relation to settlement or misuse of their funds and securities, as we always maintain trust of our clients and provide all the information to them.\\\\\\\\u201d  iii. Retention statement sent to the quarter ended 31/12/2017 and 31/03/2018 shows retention of margin obligation of the client as 325% instead of 225%.  i.  \\\\\\\\u201cWe changed our back office in 3rd quarter i.e. in October, 2017 from CLASS to tech-excel and while switching to the new back office there was a punching error in new back office in relation to retention of margin obligation of the client as 325% instead of 225% and as soon as we find the error, we rectified and corrected the same in the software.   ii. The same can be viewed from instances traced by inspection team that out of 108 instances 46 instances does not have any mistake as we rectified the punching error during the end of the fourth quarter.        Adjudication Order in respect of Swastika Commodities Private Limited                Page 14 of 39   iii. Further, we also want to draw your kind attention on the fact that the instances in which the T \\\\\\\\u2013 Day margin obligation reported as 325%, if the same calculated as 225% then also 55 accounts are settled, only 7 accounts are there which are remaining unsettled due to this error and that also settled in immediate next quarter.   iv. This observation is occurred only due to the manual punching error and there is no intentional act behind this. And this has already been intimated to the inspection team during the time of inspection as well.\\\\\\\\u201d  D. Verification of E-mail ID & Mobile numbers  a. Email ids and mobile number mapped to multiple clients  i.  \\\\\\\\u201cWe have a proper system to ensure that separate E-Mail address must be uploaded for every client and we do the same. Further, in the reported cases, clients have given common E-Mail address and mobile number in their KYC. On verification of the same, we found that the clients, who gave common mail ID, belong to the same family. Earlier there was no specified definition was provided for family members by FMC and therefore we were following the same criteria of family which includes all the members i.e. brother, sister, parents etc.  ii. But after 2016 SEBI became the regulatory body for commodity market and as per SEBI circular no. CIR/MIRSD/15/2011 dated 02nd August, 2011 applicable to commodity market as well.    iii. \\\\\\\\u201cStock Brokers shall ensure that separate mobile number/E-mail address is uploaded for each client. However, under exceptional circumstances, the stock broker may, at the specific written request of a client, upload the same mobile number/E-mail address for more than one client provided such clients belong to one family. \\\\\\\\u2018Family\\\\\\\\u2019 for this purpose would mean Self, spouse, dependent children and dependent parents.\\\\\\\\u201d        Adjudication Order in respect of Swastika Commodities Private Limited                Page 15 of 39  iv. The instances reported by inspection team that 205 email id mapped to 432 clients and 199 mobile numbers mapped to 420 clients. In this regard we want to mention that most of the clients in these instances are related persons and proper consent have been taken from them in regard to common mail id and mobile no. and some of the clients are inactive.\\\\\\\\u201d  b. Mobile Numbers and E- mail IDs of the constituents uploaded in the UCI database different from the back office records.    i.  \\\\\\\\u201cThe observations that have been provided by the inspection team in relation to Mobile No. and e-mail id of the constituents uploaded in UCI database are different from the back office records.  ii.  While verifying these account codes we found that in some of the instances correct mail id and mobile no, has been updated in exchange database as well as in our record. And in few cases where the mismatch is reflected are the accounts which are inactive in particular exchange.   iii. Further, where punching error was found the same has been rectified and correction made in our as well as exchange records.\\\\\\\\u201d    E. Analysis of Enhanced Supervision data  \\\\\\\\u201cThe instances reported by inspection team regarding bank accounts not reported to exchange under Enhanced supervision submission for INDUSIND Bank. In this regard we want to mention that while updating the banks detail on the exchange portal these banks were unintentionally missed for updation but the enhanced supervision calculation report submitted by us on weekly basis includes the detail of these banks also.

SEBI investigation revealed that the price of the scrip of Anukaran saw an abnormal rise, which was not supported by any corporate announcements or material changes in the business activities of the Company.

These sellers were also executing trades at a price higher than the LTP on a continuous basis.

It is noted that Noticee 2 & 3 have not appeared for the hearing scheduled for them on December 16, 2020.

In view of the above, I note that no prejudice has been caused to the Noticees and that the principle of natural justice has been followed as the Noticees have been given reasonable opportunities to file written representations and opportunity of personal hearing and also all the relevant documents relied upon in framing the charges against the Noticees have been provided.   6. I note that the Noticee 1 has submitted his replies vide his letters dated 05.04.2018 and 07.01.2021; Noticee 2 & 3 have submitted common replies vide their separate letters dated 18.04.2018 & 16.04.2018 respectively and Noticee 4 has submitted reply vide its letter dated 26.12.2020.   7. I have perused written replies submitted by the Noticees, the presentations made on their behalf during personal hearing and also the post-hearing submissions made by the Noticees. The contentions/ submission of the Noticees are briefly summarized as below:  Submissions of Noticee 1 a. That he is not involved in any type of malafide market making activity and insider trading. b. That he is not having any relation with any companies, promoters, directors and market makers. c. That his trading pattern is to sell quantities of scrips held by him in miniscule quantities and the trading in the scrip of ACEL has not been done by him with a manipulative intent of increasing the price of the scrip as alleged or otherwise. d. That there is no allegation whatsoever in the captioned SCN that he sold the shares of ACEL in connivance with the buyers in order to increase the price of the scrip and that he had no relation whatsoever with the counterparty to the trade and neither the said allegation has been established in the SCN. Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s Anukaran Commercial Enterprise Limited         Page5 of 45      e. That there is no allegation in the SCN against him for being connected/ having colluded with Promoter/Director/Management of ACEL and/or with the entities who are notices in the present SCN.  f. That the burden of proof is on SEBI to prove as to whether he was connected to all the entities and also whether there was any prior meeting of minds or collusion with such entities to manipulate the price of the scrip of ACEL and create a purported misleading appearance. g. That the trades were executed when the buy orders were already pending in the market. The counterparties to his trades traded as per their own choice and he did not have any control whatsoever in executing their trades. h. That he had placed his sell orders on the basis of the highest price available in the market. It is the buyers who had contributed to positive LTP. None of his counterparties have been made parties to the present SCN. If the buyers to his trade have been let scot free, then the same principle ought to be applied to him. i. That the SCN is bad in law as the same has been issued after a delay of more than 5 years of execution of alleged manipulative trades. j. That even after selling 12 shares in Patch 1 and 15 shares in Patch 2, he was left with 145 shares. No comment or observation has been made by SEBI with respect to the sale of balance 145 shares at the end of Patch II. k. That there is no allegation whatsoever against the counterparties of his trades in the scrip of ACEL to have violated any PFUTP Regulations nor any show cause notice has been issued to the said entities. l. That all the trades executed by him were in normal course of business and no fraudulent or manipulative practice can be alleged against him for such trades.  m. That it is not in his control to manage the trading by other traders in the scrip of ACEL. The other shareholders/traders traded as per their own choice. Admittedly as per the SCN, he has no connection and/or relation with any other traders i.e counterparties of ACEL. In order to prove manipulation, connection between the buyer and seller ought to be made out as an individual himself by executing a trade cannot manipulate the price of a scrip. n. It is not even the case of SEBI that he has executed circular or synchronized trades therefore merely based on the connection and the LTP contributed by him Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s Anukaran Commercial Enterprise Limited         Page6 of 45      which is miniscule, it cannot be alleged that he has violated the PFUTP Regulations.  Common Submissions of Noticee 2 & 3 a. That they are ordinary & lay investor and have dealt in the scrip of ACEL in the normal course of their trading activities. b. That all their transactions were executed through the normal screen based trading system of stock exchange.   c. That in case of screen based trading, the automated system itself matches orders on price- time priority basis and hence it is not possible for anybody to have access over the details of order/ trades/ identity of counter party dealing in any scrip. d. That there has been no grievance by any investor, broker, stock exchange or any other agency concerned w.r.t. their trading in the scrip of ACEL. e. That they have not bought, sold or otherwise dealt in shares of ACEL in fraudulent manner. f. That they have not used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or acted in contravention of the provisions of SEBI Act, Rules & Regulations made thereunder.    g. That they have not indulged in fraudulent and unfair trade practice in respect of their dealings in shares of ACEL.  Submissions of Noticee 4 a. That the investigation report has not been provided and by not providing the copy of the Investigation Report, Principle of Natural Justice is breached. b. That they had sold 100 shares of Anukaran to Mr. Rajesh C Tawari on 29-10-2012 and the consideration was received in cash. The price of the scrip of Anukaran had reached to Rs. 136.10 on 18-10-2012 before Mr. Rajesh C Tawari started trading in the shares of the Company. During this period the price of the scrip increased with a volume of 1 to 5,00,000 shares. Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s Anukaran Commercial Enterprise Limited         Page7 of 45      c. That they had not executed a single sell trade during the Patch I and II. Even their buy orders in the scrip of Anukaran during Patch I and II did not contributed to positive LTP. d. That off market transactions are per se not illegal.  e. That no connection/relation either direct or indirect had been established in between our Company and other major trader in the scrip of Anukaran during the Investigation Period. No collusion was established in between buyer and seller clients / person / entities.  f. That the allegation contained in SCN particularly as against our Company are farfetched and based on surmises, conjectures, assumption and presumptions. Furthermore, SCN is bad in law as the same has been issued after a period of more than 6 years after execution of purported off market transaction by our Company. This highly prejudices the case of the Noticee as justice delayed is justice denied.  g. That they were not having any connivance/ collusion with the purchaser.  h. That the doubt raised on the off market transactions executed is not sustainable. Their transaction is bonafide transaction and it is not challenged under the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956.  i. That it is an admitted position in the SCN that there were large demand in shares of the Anukaran during the Investigation Period. Since the demand in the shares was not filled with the supply, the price of the scrip was increased till the buyers interest remained. j. That selling shares in miniscule quantities and above the LTP per se not illegal. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT and SEBI held that trades above the LTP in minuscule quantities are per se not illegal.  k. That their Company had not employed any manipulative or deceptive device with respect to alleged off market transaction in the shares of Anukaran or neither have their Company acted in contravention of the provisions of SEBI Act and Rules/Regulations made thereunder.  l. That their Company had not employed any device, scheme or artifice to defraud anyone while dealing in the shares of Anukaran. Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s Anukaran Commercial Enterprise Limited         Page8 of 45      m. That their Company had not indulged in fraudulent and unfair trade practice in respect of alleged off market transaction in the shares of Anukaran.

I have perused the SCN dated March 23, 2018, the replies filed by the Noticees, submissions made during the course of personal hearing and written submissions filed and thereafter find that the pertinent issues that require consideration in this matter are as under:  (i) Whether the Noticees have violated the provisions of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and Regulations 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (e) of SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003?  (ii) If violations are established then whether the failure, on the part of the Noticees would attract monetary penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992?  (iii) If yes, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticees taking into consideration the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992?  ISSUE No. 1-Whether the Noticees have violated the provisions of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and Regulations 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (e) of SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003? Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s Anukaran Commercial Enterprise Limited         Page11 of 45       9. Before I proceed to examine the aforesaid issue and decide as to whether on the facts of the matter the Noticees have violated the provisions of Regulations of SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003, it would be appropriate to reproduce hereunder, the relevant provisions of SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003 as alleged to have been violated by the Noticees in the instant matter. The same are reproduced below:  SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003  3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities No person shall directly or indirectly- (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under; (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.  4.

(e) any act or omission amounting to manipulation of the price of a security;\\\\\\\\u201d  10. After having perused the replies of the Noticees, I note that the Noticee 1 & 4 have filed certain technical submissions in the form of objections to the proceedings and natural justice followed thereunder. Therefore, it is pertinent to deal with the technical submission before dealing the case on merits. It is noted that the Noticees have raised issues like non-furnishing of copy of investigation report, delay in initiating action etc. causing breach of Principle of Natural Justice and prejudice to them. In this respect, it is noted that documents which have been relied upon in the SCN to make allegations against the Noticees, have been provided to the Noticees as annexures to the SCN. Though the Noticees have contended that non-furnishing of documents and inordinate delay in proceedings have caused prejudice to them, however, the Noticees have not been successful in exhibiting the exact nature of prejudice claimed to have been caused to them. Similarly, it is also noted that the law on the issue of not giving the copy of entire investigation report is well settled to the effect that providing of documents which have been relied upon in the SCN to frame allegations/charges are treated as sufficient compliance of the principles governing the Natural Justice, unless an entity is successful in showing the prejudice caused, in case the document so demanded by it is not furnished.   11. The issue of causing a prejudice on account of non-furnishing of copy of the entire investigation report came up for consideration before Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Shruti Vora Vs. SEBI (Date of decision: February 12, 2020), wherein Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT have inter alia observed that in the absence of any law specifically imposing or casting a duty to provide all the documents which are in the possession (of SEBI) though have not been relied upon, it would not be justified on the part of the Noticees to ask for those documents which are not having a role in attributing the allegation made on the Noticees and therefore, non-furnishing of all such documents would not ipso facto result in breach of principle of nature justice. Similarly, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the case of Reliance Commodities Ltd vs. National Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s Anukaran Commercial Enterprise Limited         Page13 of 45      Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Ltd. (DoD- July 23, 2019) have inter alia observed that; \\\\\\\\u201c2. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having perused the list of documents so required for inspection we are of the opinion that the documents sought for is nothing but a roving and fishing enquiry. We accordingly do not find any merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that these documents are essential for the purpose of filing an appropriate reply. 3. However, we are of the opinion that if any document is relied by the respondent while disposing of the matter such document should be made available to the appellant\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d  12. I note that the charges levelled against the Noticees are of manipulative and fraudulent trades for which the Noticees have been provided with the findings qua them from the investigations, in the SCN. I also note that the SCN contained annexures relevant to the findings and charges levelled against the Noticees, such as trade log & order log of the scrip, transactions/ trades of the Noticees etc. Except for making a bald allegation of non-furnishing copy of investigation report, the Noticees have failed to establish any prejudice caused to them on account of such non-furnishing of the investigation report. Further, the following judgment of Hon'ble SAT on the similar issue in the case of Manoj Gaur Vs. SEBI, in Appeal Number 64 of 2012 decided on October 03,2012 is noteworthy: - \"The investigation report is not the evidence on which reliance was placed by the adjudicating officer. Since the adjudicating officer has complied with the statutory requirements, there is no legal obligation on the Board to furnish the entire investigation report to the appellants. Learned counsel for the parties have relied on certain case law relating to principles of natural justice. We do not consider it necessary to refer to all those details in view of the fact that regulation 9 of the Regulations makes it obligatory to communicate the findings in the investigation report and not the whole report. It is nobody\\\\\\\\u2019s case that such findings were not made available. If the procedure laid down in the regulations has been followed by the adjudicating officer, the grievance of violation of principles of natural justice is without any foundation.\" Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s Anukaran Commercial Enterprise Limited         Page14 of 45       13. Thus, the contention of Noticees that non-furnishing of investigation report has amounted to breach of Principle of Natural Justice is devoid of any merit as Noticees have not brought on record any reasons sufficient to satisfy that the furnishing of same was essential nor have they explained as to what prejudice was caused to them by non-furnishing of the entire investigation report. Therefore, the contention of the Noticees is rejected as the same is without any merit. Therefore, in view of the aforesaid jurisprudence, I am of the view that the principles of natural justice have not been breached and have been adequately complied with in the present matter.  14. Further, the Noticees have raised that the instant proceedings are suffering from inordinate delay and latches and SCN issued is bad in law. It has been stated that the trades alleged to be manipulative were executed in the year 2012, whereas the SCN has been issued in the year 2018. Insofar as the contention of the Noticees pertaining to delay in issuance of SCN is concerned, it is noted that the allegations in the SCN dated March 19, 2018 have been premised on the trades executed during the investigation period which is spread over January 01, 2012 to January 06, 2015. It has to be understood that in order to ascertain prima facie culpability of any delinquent, the trade data and other documents needs to be thoroughly examined during the investigation, which no doubt needs considerable time. After crystallization of the factual aspects pertaining to the case, the proceedings move further towards issuance of show cause notice. Thus, when I consider the factual aspects of the case on the basis of which the SCN has been issued in March, 2018, I do not find any reason or infirmity to drop the charges on the ground of delay as claimed by the Noticees. For the purpose of arriving at prima facie findings, all data pertaining to the scrip have to be diligently evaluated and only pursuant thereto; a show cause notice can be issued.  15. Without prejudice to the aforesaid, I may also record here that the extant framework of SEBI Act, 1992 and PFUTP Regulations do not prescribe a limitation period for initiation of action against any wrong doer for the violations of the said enactment Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s Anukaran Commercial Enterprise Limited         Page15 of 45      and rules and regulations made thereunder. Notwithstanding the above, in order to ascertain as to whether there has been actually any delay in the matter, which could be held as so inordinate that it results in causing prejudice and continuation of same tantamount to miscarriage of justice, in my view, the date when the violation came to the notice (of SEBI), would be the relevant point and not the date of actual commission of the said violation. Whether a delay in a particular case is justified or not depends on the facts and circumstances of that case. The said legal position has been endorsed by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in Ravi Mohan & Ors. vs. SEBI (Appeal no. 97/2014; Order dated December 16, 2015): \\\\\\\\u201c....................Based on decision of this Tribunal in case of HB Stockholdings Ltd. vs. SEBI (Appeal no.114 of 2012 decided on 27.08.2013) it is contended on behalf of the appellants that in view of the delay of more than 8 years in issuing the show cause notice, the impugned order is liable to be quashed and set aside. There is no merit in this contention, as it is also settled that delay itself may not be fatal in each and every case. Moreover, the Apex Court in case of Collector of Central Excise, New Delhi vs. Bhagsons Paint Industry (India) reported in 2003 (158) ELT 129 (S.C) has held that: \\\\\\\\u201c1. The Tribunal in an appeal arising under the Central Excise Act held that the adjudication made after a lapse of nearly nine years after the issue of show cause notice is not permissible and set aside the same.  2. There is no statutory bar to adjudicate the matter even after lapse of nine years after the issue of show cause notice and the adjudication pertains only to the actual levy of the duty which is due to the department and not to any levy of interest or penalty. In these circumstances we think the view taken by the Tribunal is not justified and we set aside the order made by the Tribunal and remit the matter to the Tribunal for fresh disposal in accordance with law after restoration of the appeal to its original number\\\\\\\\u2026...\\\\\\\\u201d  16. After having addressed the technical submissions, I, now, deal with the case on merit basis. I note that there is an unusual price movement in the Scrip of Anukaran during the period from January 01, 2012 to January 06, 2015. The investigation period spreads over four patches i.e. Patch 1, Patch 2, Patch 3 and patch 4. During Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s Anukaran Commercial Enterprise Limited         Page16 of 45      patch 1 i.e. before issue of bonus shares, the scrip price opened Rs. 35.15 reached high of Rs.256.25 and closed at Rs.256.25. During this patch except on 3 days the daily trading volume in the scrip was less than 1000 shares. The scrip price increased sharply, with insignificant trading volume. During Patch 2 i.e. after issue of bonus shares the scrip price opened at Rs.149.45 and reached high of Rs.306.20. During this patch there were 16 trading days with 1 trade each day. All the trades were executed for 1 share. The scrip price increased sharply, with insignificant trading volume.

NOTICEE SEBI REGISTRATION NO Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd. INR000001112  Background 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) granted a certificate of registration as a Registrar to a Issue and Share Transfer Agent (Category 1 RTA) to Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd. (Purva/Noticee) in accordance with the provisions of SEBI(Registrar to an Issue and Share Transfer Agent) Regulations, 1993 (RTA Regulations). 2. SEBI conducted an inspection of the Noticee on November 25 and November 26, 2014, and January 28 and January 29, 2015, to ascertain the level of compliance with the regulations and directions issued by SEBI for the period April 01, 2012 to September 30, 2014 (Inspection Period).  3. Pursuant to the inspection, it was noted that Noticee had allegedly violated SEBI regulations and circulars pertaining to maintenance of specimen signatures in relation to processing requests for dematerialization, rematerialization, transmission, transfer and issue of duplicate share certificate. 4. Based on the above, SEBI initiated enquiry proceedings against the Noticee under Chapter V of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 (\"Intermediaries Regulations\") and appointed a Designated Authority (\"DA\") vide order dated July 10, 2017 to enquire into alleged violations of the Noticee.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 2 of 18  5. Upon completion of the enquiry, an Enquiry Report (DA\\\\\\\\u2019s Report) dated October 31, 2018, was submitted by the DA to the Designated Member (\\\\\\\\u201cDM\\\\\\\\u201d) recommending that the Certificate of Registration of the Noticee be suspended for a period of six months. 6. Pursuant to this, a post enquiry SCN(P-SCN) dated December 17, 2018 was issued to the Noticee, under Regulation 28 (1) of SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008, to show cause as to why action, as recommended by the DA or any other action as considered appropriate should not be taken against the Noticee.  A copy of the DA\\\\\\\\u2019s Report was also forwarded to the Noticee along with an advice to file reply, if any, within 21 days from the date of receipt of the notice. The allegation raised in the P-SCN were as under, - Non Maintenance of Specimen signatures 7. It was observed during the inspection conducted by SEBI that the Noticee had not maintained complete specimen signature records for majority of the companies serviced by them. Out of the 278 companies serviced by the Noticee, it was observed that for 147 companies, the specimen signatures were not available for any of the folios. The status of availability of specimen signature observed during the inspection is given below,- Table 1  % of signature available  Number of Companies 1.  100% signature  80 2.    <50% signature 17 3.  > 50% signature 34 4.  no signatures available  147__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 3 of 18  Total  278 8. In view of the above, it was alleged that the Noticee did not have or only partially had specimen signatures for the physical folios maintained by it in respect of the majority of the companies serviced by it and thereby the Noticee had not complied with Regulation 14(3)(c) of the SEBI RTA Regulations read with Instruction 2(vii) of the RRTI circular: no.1(94-95) dated October 11, 1994.  Processing requests for transfer of shares 9. It was noted that during the course of the inspection period, the Noticee had received 18040 transfer requests. Out of the said requests, no signatures were available for 9931 transfer requests. The details of the non-compliance observed in respect of transfer of shares is given below,- Table 2 No of transfer requests received  18040 (187 companies) No. of requests were signatures were not available  9931(187 companies) No of requests processed without signatures by sending seller notice based on company\\\\\\\\u2019s instructions before the completion of 15 days seller notice  8265(69 companies) No of requests processed without signatures by sending seller notice without company\\\\\\\\u2019s instructions before the completion of 15 days seller notice 637 (19 companies)__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 4 of 18  Total no. of requests processed without signature before the completion of 15 days sellers notice 8265 + 637 = 8902   10.  It was also observed by the Inspection team that in case of transfer requests where the signatures were not available or where the signature on the transfer deed varied substantially from the signature on record, Noticee only sent no objection requests in certain cases to the sellers and did not make any further attempt to check genuineness of the share transfer request. It was also noted during the inspection that the Noticee had been processing transfer requests even prior to the completion of the 15-day period of the No objection letter issued to the sellers. It was therefore alleged that the Noticee had violated the provisions of RTA circular no.1 (2000-2001) dated May 09, 2001, and clauses 2 and 3 of the Code of Conduct prescribed under Regulation 13 of RTA Regulations. Processing of requests for dematerialisation of shares 11. It was observed during the inspection that the Noticee had processed demat request in cases where the specimen signatures were not available based on the letters provided by the Company. It was also noted that the Noticee processed demat requests based on the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s approval even in cases where the Demat Request Form was not available with the Company. The inspection team also noted that there was a delay in processing 1432 out of the 31909 demat requests processed by the Noticee during the Inspection Period.  12. In view of the above, it was alleged that the Noticee had violated the provisions of Regulation 54(5) of the SEBI(Depositories and Participants)Regulations, 1996 and clauses 2, 3 and 5(c) of the Code of Conduct prescribed under Regulation 13 of RTA Regulations.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 5 of 18  Investor Complaints regarding Jay Energy and S Energies Ltd. (JSEL) 13. I note that this particular allegation was not considered by the DA for the reasons recorded in DA\\\\\\\\u2019s Report and therefore was also not a ground in the P-SCN.   HEARING AND REPLY  14. Noticee submitted its reply vide letter dated January 20, 2021. Subsequently, an opportunity of personal hearing was given to the Noticee on January 21, 2021. At the hearing, Mr. Prakash Shah, Advocate and Ms. Purva Shah, Director, represented the Noticee. Summary of the submissions made are given below,- a. The alleged violations pertain to the period 2012 \\\\\\\\u2013 2014, and the Noticee has been seamlessly rendering services to their clients since then without any adverse observations or remarks from the Regulator. Further, the rules governing transfer of shares have drastically changed since then and after 31.03.2019, no fresh physical transfer of shares are allowed. In view of the same, suspension of registration as recommended by Enquiry Officer is too harsh, unwarranted, unjustified and will cause great harm, loss and damage to all stakeholders. b. Post the Inspection Period, SEBI has come out with various clarifications and circulars including revised SEBI(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, Circulars dated 20-04 2018 and 06-11-2018 regarding the process to be followed in such cases and the Noticee has promptly complied with the same and also has taken all corrective steps and remedial measures as required to ensure that lapses, if any, observed during inspection conducted for the period from 01.04.2012 to 30.09.2014 are not repeated thereafter. c. On consideration of the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s track record post inspection, the direction to suspend our certificate of registration is too harsh, unwarranted and unjustified.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 6 of 18  d. Noticee provides services to a large number of Companies which includes listed and unlisted Companies and at present handles close to 1.5 million folios. Noticee is ranked amongst top 5 for many of the years by Prime Database in the yearly data released for IPOs. e. Between 2011 to 2020, out of more than 300 listed companies for whom the Noticee has provided RTA and related services, only 341 complaints were filed on SEBI SCORES. All such complaints have been satisfactorily resolved and closed as on date. Specimen Signature f. Specimen Signatures that have been provided to the Noticee by the companies (clients) have been properly preserved and no lapse has been found regarding the same. Thus the allegation about non-availability of specimen signature basically lies with the companies and not the Noticee.  g. As per the agreement executed with the companies, they are required to hand over all records including records of specimen signature. However, companies whose trading was suspended for a long period of time were not in a position to hand over such records and even other RTAs were also faced with similar situation. Therefore, the matter was referred to SEBI through Registrar Association of India (RAIN). Thereupon under SEBI LODR, 2015 specific mention was incorporated about process to be followed in cases where signature records are not available with RTA. h. For transfer of shares where signature records were not provided by the respective Companies, the Noticee has followed proper due care and diligence such as ensuring bonafides of the buyer, seeking confirmation from the client companies__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 7 of 18  etc. In view thereof, no seller has raised any grievance against Noticee for any erroneous transfer carried out till date. i. Noticee and their client companies have made all reasonable efforts to get updated recent signature from the investors by sending letters to investors, appealing to investors in the annual reports etc. However, not even 1 % of investors have responded to the said appeal.  Agreement with clients j. Noticee has entered into agreement with all the client companies. Pursuant to the said agreement with the client companies, the companies had agreed to provide the Noticee with all the shareholders records. Importantly the said agreement executed with all the client companies were as per the format approved by SEBI. One of the clauses of the agreement as per the SEBI prescribed format provides as under:  \"The company will ensure that all records /reports/ documents are handed over to the Transfer Agents after its appointment. The responsibility of the Transfer Agency will commence on receipt of records/reports/documents.\" k. Thus, it was company's responsibility to maintain signature records over period of time and hand over to RTA after appointment. The responsibility of the RTA starts only when RTA receives the signature records. If the records of the signatures, were not maintained by the company, RTA cannot be held liable for action of the company. An agent cannot be penalized for records not handed over by the principal to the agent.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 8 of 18  Submission with respect to transfer of shares where no signature records were available l. In the regular course, all the transfer of shares effected by the Noticee were approved by the share transfer committee of the respective company. Further practicing Company Secretary of every company routinely visited their office and verified that all the transfers were carried out properly and in timely manner. Every such company has submitted half yearly report to the Stock Exchange as required under clause 47 of listing agreement issued by their Company Secretary.  Further records of all the transfers were included in their Annual Return filed with MCA. Hence, belatedly no adverse inferences ought to be drawn against the Noticee on execution of such transfer of shares since all transfers were approved and accounted for by the company. m. To further substantiate facts with respect to obtaining approval from the issuer company for transfer of shares, Noticee also asked their client companies to furnish the confirmation letters in respect of transfers. n. In the Enquiry Report, it is alleged that out of the 18040 share transfer requests received, Noticee had processed 9931 share transfer requests wherein the signatures were not available or the signatures on the transfer deeds varied substantially from the signature available on record. In this regard, it was submitted that the Noticee had carried out its obligation in a prompt, ethical and professional manner as stipulated u/r 13 of the \"Code of Conduct\". They have received only 16 complaints out of 18040 requests and the same were resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant. o. It was further submitted that the due diligence done by the Noticee in such cases includes the following:__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 9 of 18  (a) To check whether the Transfer deed is valid  (b) Proper details have been filled on the transfer deed by transferor  (c) Transfer form is duly witnessed and name, address and signature exists. (d) Execution date is within one year of presentation date.  (e) Transferee details are properly filled in and signed by all transferees.  (f) Consideration amount is filled and proper stamp duty has been paid.  (g) PAN card of the transferee is attached and hence he is KYC compliant. Further it is also verified as to whether he can be contacted in the event of any objection by the transferor even at a later date.  (h) Genuineness of Certificates. (i) Common Seal of the company was affixed on the share certificate.  (j) The name of the transferor was printed on the share certificate.  (k) No complaint was received by the company regarding the loss of share certificates from the transferor.  (l) The share certificates were not flagged for \"STOP TRANSFER\" instructions in their database.  (m) The folio no., certificate no., distinctive no. and no. of shares were printed on the share certificate.  (n) The details were matched with the master data of the company. (o)15 days' notice was sent to transferor giving him an intimation that his shares were received for transfer and in case of any objections he may contact the Noticee.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 10 of 18  (p) In case any objection was received, Noticee immediately stopped the transfer and asked transferor to lodge a police complaint and get stay order from appropriate court. It was submitted that only 16 transferors replied to seller notice\\\\\\\\u2019s sent by the Noticee till date. Further, even when such sellers were provided the copy of transfer deed and asked to get stay order from appropriate court, they did not go ahead and only after not receiving any response from the seller, the Noticee transferred those shares in transferee's names.  p. Noticee was of the view that if they had rejected the transfers, it would have resulted in double advantage to the Transferor who would even after having sold the shares, would be receiving the corporate benefits attached to those shares. Further, such transferors would not be ready to cooperate with the procedure of registering their signature again by incurring extra costs of affidavit, bank attestation, etc. since it was not their fault that the company had lost their signature and the shares would have continued to remain in their names. q. The rejection would amount to gross injustice to the transferee since even after paying due consideration to the transferor, the shares could not be transferred in his name and would lose out on corporate benefits like dividend, rights, bonus, etc. r. Post the introduction of LODR, Noticee has clearly followed the rules, regulations and guidelines prescribed in the LODR which can be proved by the inspection carried out by SEBI March 2019 wherein no deviation from the rules was found. s. Since 2009, SEBI has made PAN card of the transferee compulsory. Besides these shares could not be sold at any stock exchanges in physical form since shares had to be traded compulsorily in dematerialized form. KYC of the transferees was available with the DP hence these transferees were not fly by night investors who__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 11 of 18  could misuse the system and run away. The SEBI registered intermediaries viz. brokers and the DP only after knowing these transferees would allow them to trade on stock exchange. They could always be traced and legal action could be taken against the transferee even if it was found at later date that the transaction was not genuine and fraudulently transferred. t. With regards to the allegation that Noticee transferred shares even before completion of 15 days from sending the no objection letter to the seller, it was submitted that in the year 2012 vide SEBI circular dated 05.07.2012 bearing Reference No. CIR/MIRSD/8/2012, SEBI had reduced the time frame for effecting transfer of shares from 30 days to 15 days. Due to the same, it was not possible for the Noticee to comply with the requirement of providing 15 days\\\\\\\\u2019 notice as the same would have led to the Noticee breaching the 15 days\\\\\\\\u2019 limit prescribed for processing such requests.  u. The Noticee has not gained any unfair advantage by doing such a practice and has always followed the practice where the buyer or the seller do not get into an advantageous position over the other. Delay with respect to dematerialisation  v. Delay noted in the SCN were caused due to reasons beyond the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s control and were still a small proportion of the total requests processed by the Noticee. It was further submitted that out of the 1431 cases of delay pointed out in the SEBI inspection, 1098 requests were generated prior to the Noticee taking over the RTA activities in respect of those companies. Further, 212 requests were for unlisted companies and therefore not under the purview of SEBI and 94 requests were received late by the Noticee from the DP. Only in 34 requests out of the 31909 dematerialisation requests, which was less than .10% of the requests that were__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 12 of 18  processed by the Noticee, there was any delay which could be attributed to the Noticee.  Consideration  15. I have considered the Report submitted by the DA, the Post-Enquiry SCN issued to the Noticee, oral and written submissions of the Noticee along with the documents contained therein and other material available on record. The provisions of the law which have been alleged to have been violated by the Noticee, in the SCN, are reproduced below,- SEBI (RTA) Regulations  \\\\\\\\u201c13.

Note : Procedure under 3.2 .1 and 3.2.2 above shall apply for recording fresh specimen signature for entire holding under a folio. 3.2.1 an affidavit with the Company / STA as per Annexure-07\\\\\\\\u201d   16. Now, I move on to consider the issues on merit.,- Issue 1 \\\\\\\\u2013 Non Maintenance of Specimen signatures 17. I note that the primary allegation levelled against the Noticee is that it had failed to maintain specimen signatures of the shareholders holding shares in physical form in the companies serviced by it. As reproduced above, Regulations 14(3)(c) read with Instructions to Registrars to an Issue / Share Transfer Agents issued vide RRTI Circular: No.1 (94-95), dated 11-10-1994, required all RTAs to maintain specimen signature cards in relation to physical folios processed by it. 18. I note that it is an admitted fact that the Noticee had specimen signatures for 100% of the folios only in respect of 80 out of the 287 companies serviced by it. The details regarding percentage of folios for which the Noticee had specimen signatures available on record is given in table 1 of this order.  19. I note that crosschecking with specimen signature while processing transfer/demat/duplicate share request of folios held in the physical form is an important safeguard against fraudulent transfer of securities held in the physical form.  20. Noticee in its reply has stated that all the companies for which 100% of the specimen signatures were not available with it, had become their clients subsequent to their Initial__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 15 of 18  Public Offering; and these companies had not provided complete specimen signatures at the time they were onboarded.  21. I note that the SEBI Circular dated October 11, 1994 mandates the STA to maintain specimen signature cards and therefore the Noticee was bound to call for and obtain the specimen signature cards from the Company. I note that Noticee has submitted details of the efforts undertaken by it to obtain the specimen signatures in respect of folios where they were not available and the same is stated in para 13(i) above. However, despite such efforts, specimen signatures for all the folios maintained by the Noticee could not be obtained.  22.  I, therefore, find that the Noticee has contravened this provision 14(3)(c) read with Instructions to Registrars to an Issue / Share Transfer Agents issued vide RRTI Circular: No.1 (94-95), dated 11-10-1994. Issue 2 \\\\\\\\u2013 Processing of requests for dematerialisation of shares  23. I note from the SCN that it was observed during the inspection carried out by SEBI that the Noticee was processing requests for dematerialization in respect of physical folios where specimen signatures were not available based on instructions provided by the issuer companies. Further, it was also alleged that even in cases where the Demat Requests Forms were not available with the companies, the Noticee was processing demat requests based on the instructions received from the Companies.  It was also alleged that there was a delay in processing 1432 demat requests received by the Noticee during the Inspection Period.  24. Noticee in its reply has not disputed the finding in the inspection report and has only stated that in such cases the Noticee was complying with the instruction given by the issuer companies.  I, therefore, note that the Noticee was not taking adequate steps to independently verify the genuineness of such requests and was processing such requests only based on the instructions of the issuer companies.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 16 of 18  25. In respect of the delay in processing the demat requests, it was submitted by the Noticee that in overwhelming majority of the such cases, the Noticee was appointed as the RTA after such requests were received and therefore the delay in such cases cannot be attributed to the Noticee. In this regard, it is however noted that delay in processing demat requests in cases where the RTA is appointed after the date when such request was made, is calculated as the difference between the confirmation date and the date of appointment of the new RTA. In view of the same, the submission made of the Noticee in this regard cannot be accepted.  26. Clauses 3 of the Code of Conduct under the RTA Regulations provides that RTAs shall at all times exercise due diligence, ensure proper care and exercise independent professional judgement. In view of the above, I am of the view that the conduct of the Noticee in processing dematerialisation requests has not been in compliance with the Code of Conduct specified under the RTA Regulations.  Issue 3 \\\\\\\\u2013 Processing requests for transfer of shares 27. I note from the SCN that it was observed during the inspection carried out by SEBI that the Noticee was processing transfer of shares in respect of physical folios where specimen signatures were not available by sending no objection letter to the sellers and without making any further attempts to check the genuineness of the transfer requests.  28. I note that as per point 3 of the \\\\\\\\u2018Norms for objections\\\\\\\\u2019 as prescribed under RTI circular No. 1 (2000-2001), in cases of material difference in signatures of transferors in the transfer deed when compared to the specimen signature, the STA needs to send an objection memo to the transferee marking the reason for objection as \\\\\\\\u2018material signature difference\\\\\\\\u2019. A copy of the objection memo also has to be sent to the transferors with an advice to lodge documents to facilitate the STA to take on record fresh specimen signatures.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Purva Shareregistry (India) Pvt. Ltd.                         Page 17 of 18  29. In this regard, I am of the view that the Noticee should have adopted the above mentioned approach and obtained specimen signatures before processing transfer requests in folios held in physical form where specimen signatures were not available with the Noticee.  30. It is further noted that in respect of 4 transfer requests where there was a complete mismatch of signature on the transfer deed with the specimen signature on record, transfer was effected by the Noticee only on the basis of the confirmation received from the Company.  31. As noted above, Clause 3 of the Code of Conduct provides that RTAs shall at all times exercise due diligence, proper care and independent professional judgement and not blindly follow the instructions of the Company.  32. In view of the above, I find that the Noticee has not strictly complied with the \\\\\\\\u2018Norms of Objection\\\\\\\\u2019 prescribed under RTI circular No. 1 (2000-2001), point \\\\\\\\u201ch\\\\\\\\u201d of Schedule 1 of RRTI Circular dated October 11, 1994 and clauses 3 of the Code of Conduct under the RTA Regulations, while processing transfer requests where specimen signatures were not available. 33. I, however, also note that there are no pending investor grievances in respect of any of the requests that have been processed by the Noticee without strictly complying with the norms laid down by SEBI. It is further noted that there were no adverse remarks leading to initiation of any enforcement proceeding post the inspection of the Noticee by SEBI in 2019. Order 34.

IN RESPECT OF \\\\\\\\u2013 NOTICEE ALLIANCE INTERMEDIARIES AND NETWORK PRIVATE LIMITED MEMBER, INTER-CONNECTED STOCK EXCHANGE OF INDIA LTD.  SEBI REGISTRATION NO. - INB 241104935   BACKGROUND \\\\\\\\u2013  1. Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019) is registered with Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) as a member of Inter-Connected Stock Exchange of India Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018ICSEIL\\\\\\\\u2019) having SEBI registration number INB241104935. The Noticee was also a sub-broker (INS230783537) of National Stock Exchange (NSE) affiliated to ISE Securities & Services Limited, a member of NSE. However, the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s registration as sub-broker of NSE was cancelled on February 19, 2004.   2. SEBI received a letter dated November 27, 2013 from the Office of the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, Mumbai, seeking information regarding certain transactions purportedly executed by an assessee \\\\\\\\u2018Virendra___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 2 of 16 Bhupati Doshi HUF\\\\\\\\u2019 with a Stock Broker (Noticee). The said letter enclosed bills for purchase or sale of shares (Contract Notes) issued by the Noticee to Virendra Bhupati Doshi HUF. SEBI received another letter dated December 06, 2013 from the Income Tax Authority inter alia informing that a search action conducted by the Mumbai Investigation Wing in the case of Mahasagar Group of cases had revealed instances where certain brokers including the Noticee were engaged in fraudulent billing and making accommodation entries for clients in order to enable them to book speculative profits and short term / long term capital gains / losses. Such help was provided by the brokers including the Noticee to their clients by feeding bogus saudas in the system and generating bogus bills. The transactions mentioned in those bills were not done through the stock exchange, but the bills showed them to be so, in order to make them appear as genuine transactions done through the stock exchanges. The brokers used to accept cash from the clients against these bills and thereafter they used to issue cheques to the clients. The said letter from Income Tax Authority further stated that Shri Mukesh Choksi, one of the directors of the Noticee, in his statement under Section 131 of Income Tax Act on January 01, 2013 had confessed that he was providing accommodation entries to any person who approached him and had floated around 36 companies from his office to facilitate the same.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 3 of 16 3. Subsequently, Mr. Mukesh Choksi appeared before the Investigating Authority, SEBI, on December 27, 2013 and in his statement recorded before the Investigating Authority, he submitted inter alia the following: (a) As on date, the Noticee was a member of ICSEIL having registration no. INB241104935. The registration of the Noticee as a sub-broker of NSE was cancelled in 2004. (b) Mihir Agencies Private Limited, Alpha Cheme Trade Agencies Private Limited, Buniyad Chemical Limited, Talent Infoway Ltd. and Richmond Securities Private Limited were associate entities / companies of the Noticee. As on date, there was no business in these companies.  (c) During 2004 to 2007, contract notes were issued by intermediaries (i.e. person of any business in the market) to clients (individual entities) on behalf of the Noticee on accepting cash from intermediaries and giving cheques by the Noticee to intermediaries. The Noticee was earning commission of 0.15% for the deposit of cash in its various companies.  (d) As regards the process of passing \\\\\\\\u201caccommodation entries\\\\\\\\u201d, cheques were issued against cash and vice-versa without any transaction. These were adjustment entries and the client was at liberty to use them the way he wanted. (e) The modus operandi followed for issuing fake contract notes for speculative profits / losses on behalf of clients was as follows. The intermediaries (persons of any business in the market) used to contact___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 4 of 16 the Noticee. Thereafter, the Noticee used to open bank accounts in the intermediaries\\\\\\\\u2019 vicinity. The Noticee then used to give signed cheque books of its companies and the intermediaries used to manage these accounts. The Noticee used to get commission of 0.15% on the total deposits in such accounts. This was done to convert money from black to white and vice-versa. The Noticee had stopped doing the same since November 2009 after the Income Tax search.  4. Further, it was observed that the contract notes issued by the Noticee to Virendra B Doshi HUF were unsigned i.e. did not bear the signature of Authorized Person of the Noticee. The name of the stock exchange where the trades had taken place had not been specified in any of the contract notes issued by the Noticee to several persons. In all the contract notes issued by the Noticee, it mentioned its SEBI Registration number as INB-230783537/23/10777 which was not the correct registration number as the Noticee was not a sub-broker of NSE at the time of issuance of the said contract notes. The Noticee in certain contract notes had shown itself as a broker of NSE whereas in reality it was neither a broker nor a sub-broker of NSE at the time when the contract notes were issued. The Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s registration as sub-broker of NSE was cancelled on February 19, 2004 i.e. much before the issuance of the said contract notes. Further, certain contract notes mentioned the Noticee as a dealer of ICSEIL and sub-broker of NSE whereas___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 5 of 16 in reality the Noticee was a broker of ICSEIL and not a dealer and its sub-brokership with NSE was already cancelled at the time of issuance of such contract notes.  5. It was therefore alleged that the Noticee misused its SEBI registration certificate and issued bogus / fictitious contract notes against cash to several persons for the transactions that did not take place at the Stock Exchange and only used accommodation (adjustment) entries to enable its clients to show short term / long term profit / losses in their books for tax purpose etc. The Noticee was therefore alleged to have violated the provisions of Clauses A(1), A(2), A(3) and A(5) of Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II read with Regulation 7 SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers Regulations, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cStock Brokers Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d in short), SEBI Circular No.SMD-1/23341 dated November 18, 1993, SEBI Circular No. SEBI/MRD/SE/Cir-33/2003/27/08 dated August 27, 2003, Master Circular no. CIR/ISD/AML/3/2010 on AML/CFT guidelines dated December 31, 2010. It was further alleged that the Noticee had violated the provisions of Regulation 5(e) read with Regulation 5A of the Stock Brokers Regulations by not being a fit and proper person as per the criteria set out in the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 (\\\\\\\\u201cIntermediaries Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d in short).___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 6 of 16 6. Considering the above, SEBI initiated proceedings under Regulation 24(1) of the Intermediaries Regulations against the Noticee and appointed a Designated Authority (DA) to enquire into the aforesaid violations. The DA issued a show cause notice (SCN) dated July 24, 2018 to the Noticee under Regulation 25(1) of the Intermediaries Regulations and upon a consideration of the facts before him, found the Noticee to be in violation of the abovementioned provisions of law. Accordingly, the DA, vide her report dated August 29, 2018 (DA Report), submitted under Regulation 27 of the Intermediaries Regulations, recommended that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s certificate of registration as a stock broker be cancelled.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING \\\\\\\\u2013 7. Thereafter, a show cause notice dated September 11, 2018 (\\\\\\\\u201cpost-enquiry SCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to the Noticee, enclosing therewith a copy of the DA Report, calling upon the Noticee to show cause as to why action as recommended by the DA or any other penalty should not be imposed on it in terms of Regulation 28(1) and (2) of the Intermediaries Regulations, as deemed fit by the Competent Authority.  8. The post-enquiry SCN sent to the Noticee returned undelivered. Thereafter, a copy of the post-enquiry SCN was uploaded on the SEBI website under the section \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201cUnserved Summons / Notices that could not be served\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, a notice regarding the post-enquiry SCN was also published in newspapers___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 7 of 16 (Hindustan Times \\\\\\\\u2013 English, Navbharat Times \\\\\\\\u2013 Hindi) on August 10, 2020. The said notice in the newspapers also contained an intimation about a personal hearing in the matter which was scheduled on September 16, 2020. However, even after the publication of the notice in newspapers, no response was received from the Noticee. Considering these facts and circumstances, I am constrained to proceed in the matter ex-parte, entirely on the basis of material available on record.   CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS \\\\\\\\u2013 9. I have examined the facts of the case and the charges against the Noticee. I note that the Noticee is alleged to have violated Clauses A(1), A(2), A(3) and A(5) of Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II read with Regulation 7 of Brokers Regulations, SEBI Circular No.SMD-1/23341 dated November 18, 1993, SEBI Circular No. SEBI/MRD/SE/Cir-33/2003/27/08 dated August 27, 2003, Master Circular no. CIR/ISD/AML/3/2010 on AML/CFT guidelines dated December 31, 2010 and provisions of Regulations 5(e) read with Regulation 5A of the Stock Brokers Regulations read with Schedule II of the Intermediaries Regulations. I note that the erstwhile Regulation 7 which mandated compliance with the Code of Conduct by a stock broker has been omitted and the provisions thereof have now been incorporated under Regulation 9(f) with effect from 27-09-2013. Similarly, the provisions which have been part of Clause A(5) of the Code of Conduct prescribed under___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 8 of 16 Schedule II of the Stock Brokers Regulations have been further included under Regulation 9(b) with effect from 27-09-2013. However, I note that the alleged violations in this matter pertain to a period prior to the said amendments in the Stock Brokers Regulations, since the dates of the contract notes issued by the Noticee pertain to the years 2007 and 2008. Therefore, I deem it fit to refer to provisions of Stock Brokers Regulations as they existed then. The same are quoted below:  SEBI (Brokers Regulations) Regulation 7. Stock brokers to abide by Code of Conduct- The Stock Broker holding a certificate shall at all times abide by the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II. SCHEDULE II  SEBI (Brokers Regulations) (Regulation 7) A. GENERAL (1) INTEGRITY: A stock-broker, shall maintain high standards of integrity, promptitude and fairness in the conduct of all his business. (2) EXERCISE OF DUE SKILL AND CARE: A stock-broker, shall act with due skill, care and diligence in the conduct of all his business. (3) MANIPULATION: A stock-broker shall not indulge in manipulative, fraudulent or deceptive transactions or schemes or spread rumours with a view to distorting market equilibrium or making personal gains.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 9 of 16 (5) COMPLIANCE WITH STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS: A stock-broker shall abide by all the provisions of the Act and the rules, regulations issued by the Government, the Board and the stock exchange from time to time as may be applicable to him.  10. As regards the abovementioned circulars alleged to have been violated by the Noticee, I note that the provisions of SEBI Circular No.SMD-1/23341 dated November 18, 1993 and SEBI Circular No. SEBI/MRD/SE/Cir-33/2003/27/08 dated August 27, 2003 clearly prohibit a broker from accepting / giving cash from / to the clients for purchase or sale of securities and prescribes that all payments received from / made to clients should be strictly by crossed account Payee cheques / demand drafts / ETF / any other mode allowed by RBI. As regards the provisions of Master Circular no. CIR/ISD/AML/3/2010 on AML/CFT guidelines dated December 31, 2010 allegedly violated by the Noticee, I note that the said Circular has been issued after the alleged violations.   11. I note from records that as per the findings of Income Tax Department, the Noticee was engaged in making accommodation entries for clients to facilitate speculative short term / long term profits / losses. Such help was provided by the Noticee to its clients by feeding bogus saudas in the system and generating speculative profit / loss entries without actually executing any underlying transactions on the recognized stock exchanges. The Income Tax___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 10 of 16 Department also provided to SEBI the copies of contract notes issued by the Noticee to its clients.  12. On examination of the abovementioned contract notes issued by the Noticee to Virendra Bhupati Doshi HUF which were forwarded by Income Tax Dept. to SEBI vide letter dated 27.11.2013 and were enclosed as Annexure B to the SCN dated July 24, 2018 issued by the DA, I note that the same were unsigned i.e. did not bear the signature of the authorized person of the Noticee. Further, the said contract notes, which are shown to have been issued in 2007, describe the Noticee as \\\\\\\\u201cBroker of N.S.E. Member\\\\\\\\u201d having SEBI Registration number as \\\\\\\\u201cINB-230783537/23-10777\\\\\\\\u201d. However, as per the available records, the Noticee was neither a member nor a sub-broker of NSE in 2007. Further, the SEBI registration number mentioned on the said contract notes (i.e. INB-230783537/23-10777) pertained to the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s registration as a sub-broker (affiliated to M/s. ISE Securities & Services Ltd., TM Code: 10777) with NSE (date of registration: October 12, 2000) which was cancelled on February 19, 2004 itself. Similarly, on examination of the contract notes issued by Noticee to Mr. Ashok Kumar, Dinesh Bhikhabhai Ghevariya, Radha Govind Lashkari and Radha Govind Lashkari HUF, which were enclosed as Annexure D and E to the SCN dated July 24, 2018 issued by the DA, I note that the same suffer from similar irregularities and factual inconsistencies as above. Further, a large number of contract notes also mentioned the Noticee as a dealer of___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 11 of 16 ICSEIL whereas in reality the Noticee is a broker of ICSEIL and not a dealer. I further note from records that ICSEIL vide email dated March 07, 2014 had informed SEBI that the Noticee had not done any trade as its trading member from the date of grant of certificate of registration till February 28, 2014. I further note that while some of the abovementioned contract notes refer to the applicability of Rules, Bye-laws and Regulations of the ICSEIL to the contracts mentioned therein, a number of contract notes do not show the name of the exchange on which the transactions mentioned therein were executed and simply refer to \\\\\\\\u201cThe Stock Exchange, Mumbai\\\\\\\\u201d. The abovementioned observations clearly indicate that the said contract notes are fake and contain bogus details.   13. Apart from the above, I further note that Mr. Mukesh Choksi, a director of the Noticee, in his statement dated 27.12.2013 to the Investigating Authority of SEBI, which was enclosed as Annexure F to the SCN dated July 24, 2018 issued by the DA, has admitted that fictitious contract notes were issued against cash without execution of any transaction on recognized stock exchange. He has further admitted that these were mere accommodation entries which involved issue of cheques against cash and vice-versa without carrying out any transaction. He further admitted that the fake contract notes helped clients to book speculative profits / losses. I further note that though the Noticee has___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 12 of 16 not responded to the post-enquiry SCN, during the proceeding before the DA, it had, vide letter dated August 03, 2018 submitted inter alia the following: (a) The Noticee was doing the business of discounting and issuing of cheques wherein it used to open its bank accounts and give signed cheque books to its sub-brokers or intermediaries who then used to give the cheques to their clients and get the bills printed of their choice. The bills and contract notes were prepared by the clients themselves. The Noticee did not know who was using the cheques and what the nature and purpose of such transactions were. (b) The Noticee was paid 0.15 % commission on the amount of transaction done in the bank at the end of the month and it was earning Rs. 20,000/- to Rs. 25,000/- per month as commission. This method of earning income by the Noticee was accepted by the Income Tax department, which had made assessment on such income and had allowed 50% the expenses claimed against the income of commission. (c) The clients were using these entries to show profit from shares, short term gain, long term gain, one-time loan etc. The bills were prepared and printed by sub-brokers or intermediaries as per their choice. The Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s role was limited to giving signed cheque books and receiving commission @0.15% and it had not printed or authorized the bills.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 13 of 16 14. From the above, it is very clear that the Noticee was actively and wilfully carrying out the business of issuing fake and bogus contract notes against receipt of cash to show fictitious transactions as genuine ones and enable its clients to book fictitious speculative gains and short / long term gains / losses for tax purposes. I note that the activities of the Noticee, as detailed above, were inherently fraudulent and were aimed at aiding and abetting tax frauds. In view of the same, I conclude that the Noticee, by indulging in the abovementioned activities as a broker, failed to exercise due skill, care and diligence, failed to maintain high standard of integrity, promptitude and fairness in conduct of its business and indulged in fraudulent and deceptive schemes with a view to make personal gains. Further, the Noticee by indulging in acts as mentioned above, which included acceptance of cash from clients, has also violated the provisions of SEBI Circular No.SMD-1/23341 dated November 18, 1993 and SEBI Circular No. SEBI/MRD/SE/Cir-33/2003/27/08 dated August 27, 2003 which prohibit a broker from accepting / giving cash from / to the clients. Accordingly, the charges of violation of the Clauses A(1), A(2), A(3) and A(5) of Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II read with erstwhile Regulation 7 of the Stock Brokers Regulations against the Noticee stand established.  15. It is further alleged that by virtue of being involved in the abovementioned violations, the Noticee was no longer a \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019, and thereby___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 14 of 16 has violated Regulation 5(e) read with Regulation 5A of the Stock Brokers Regulations read with provisions of Schedule II of the Intermediaries Regulations. I note that the abovementioned provisions, as they existed at the relevant time, are as under: \\\\\\\\u201cStock Brokers Regulations 5. Consideration of application \\\\\\\\u2013 The Board shall take into account for considering the grant of a certificate all matters relating to buying, selling, or dealing in securities and in particular the following, namely, whether the stock broker \\\\\\\\u2013  (a)\\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 (b) \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 (c) \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 (d) \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 (e) is a fit and proper person.  5A. Criteria for fit and proper person \\\\\\\\u2013 For the purpose of determining whether an applicant or the stock broker, sub-broker, trading member and clearing member is a fit and proper person the Board may take into account the criteria specified in Schedule II of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008.  Schedule II of the Intermediaries Regulations Criteria for determining a \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019  For the purpose of determining as to whether an applicant or the intermediary is a \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 the Board may take account of any consideration as it deems fit, including but not limited to the following criteria in relation to the applicant or the intermediary, the___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 15 of 16 principal officer, the director, the promoter and the key management persons by whatever name called \\\\\\\\u2013  (a) integrity, reputation and character;  (b) absence of convictions and restraint orders;  (c) competence including financial solvency and networth; (d) absence of categorization as a wilful defaulter.\\\\\\\\u201d   16. I note that the requirement to be a fit and proper person has to be met by a stock broker on a continuous basis, since compliance with the same is mentioned as one of the conditions for grant of registration under sub-regulation (e) of Regulation 5 of the Stock Brokers Regulations. I further note that the provisions of Schedule II of the Intermediaries regulations specifically provide that SEBI may take into account the integrity, reputation and character of an entity in order to determine whether it qualifies to be a fit and proper person or not. In this context, I note that the abovementioned fraudulent acts and violations by the Noticee reflect very poorly on the integrity, reputation and character of the Noticee. The same has rendered the Noticee ineligible to qualify as a fit and proper person and its continuation as a registered intermediary has become untenable. Since the Noticee is no longer fit to continue as a registered intermediary of SEBI, any continuation of the same would be detrimental to the interests of the securities market. In view of the same, I am inclined to accept the recommendation that the certificate of registration of the Noticee as a stock broker be cancelled.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Alliance Intermediaries and Network Private Limited           Page 16 of 16 Accordingly, this order is being passed under Regulation 27(5) of the Intermediaries Regulations, which substituted Regulation 28 of the Intermediaries Regulations, with effect from January 21, 2021.

Charge no.1: \\\\\\\\n2.1 \\\\\\\\nViolation of Guideline 2 read with Guideline 15 (5) (d): The guidelines state \\\\\\\\nthat the MISP or any of its associate company, shall not receive directly or \\\\\\\\nindirectly from the Insurer and the Insurer shall not pay directly or indirectly to the \\\\\\\\nMISP or any of its associate company any fees, charges, infrastructure, \\\\\\\\nadvertising expenses, documentation charges, legal fees, or any other payment \\\\\\\\nby whatever name called except as specified in the said guidelines. \\\\\\\\nThe insurer made indirect payments to MISP, automotive dealers and designated \\\\\\\\npersons on the name of 'advertisement' and 'professional charges'. \\\\\\\\n2.2 \\\\\\\\nSummary of Insurer's submissions: \\\\\\\\n2.2.1 The insurer submitted that the company had an arrangement since 2015 for \\\\\\\\ndisplay of marketing materials through the sales outlets of M/s. T V Sundaram \\\\\\\\nIyengar & Sons Pvt Ltd (TVS), as the insurer found more opportunity to increase \\\\\\\\nits brand visibility and increase insurer's presence in 2 and 3 tier towns by \\\\\\\\nentering into advertisement contracts. The insurer further stated that the \\\\\\\\ncompany had entered into an agreement with the entity on 1st April, 2018 for \\\\\\\\ndisplay of advertising material after the notice of termination of corporate agency \\\\\\\\nby M/s Daimler Financial Services India Pvt Ltd (Daimler). The insurer explained \\\\\\\\nthat there was no connection between the arrangement that the company had \\\\\\\\nwith TVS for display of advertising material and their MISP arrangement with \\\\\\\\nDaimler. It was informed that the agreement with the TVS was terminated in \\\\\\\\nDecember, 2019. \\\\\\\\n2.2.2The insurer submitted that it had identified potential locations where there were \\\\\\\\nbusiness opportunities and entered into arrangement for advertisement with the \\\\\\\\nauto dealers with a strategy to promote and tap business opportunities which \\\\\\\\nwere essential for the growth. Further, it is stated that the company took steps to \\\\\\\\nterminate all the arrangements with the identified dealers as the insurer found \\\\\\\\nthem to be MISPs sponsored by insurance intermediaries. \\\\\\\\n2.2.3As regards the payments made to the designated persons of MISPs as \\\\\\\\nmentioned in SCN under professional charges, the insurer submitted that the \\\\\\\\npayments pertain to transactions for a period before the implementation of MISP \\\\\\\\nGuidelines. \\\\\\\\nPage 2 of 6\\\\\\\\n2.3 \\\\\\\\nDecision on Charge no.1: \\\\\\\\n2.3.1 The insurer has stated that it had arrangements (without any formal agreement) \\\\\\\\nwith TVS for display of advertisement material since 2015. TVS is an MISP \\\\\\\\nsponsored by Daimler from 12th November, 2017. The insurer had a corporate \\\\\\\\nagency arrangement with Daimler between December, 2016 to 30th April, 2018. \\\\\\\\n2.3.2 The insurer entered into an agreement with TVS for display of advertisement \\\\\\\\nmaterial for a period of three years with effect from 1st April, 2018. Thus the \\\\\\\\ninsurer had continued the arrangement for display of advertisement material with \\\\\\\\nTVS during the period from 12th November, 2017 to 30th April, 2018 though TVS \\\\\\\\nwas an MISP sponsored by Daimler during the said period. \\\\\\\\n2.3.3 In addition to sponsorship through Daimler, TVS is also sponsored as MISP by \\\\\\\\nthe following intermediaries owing to different Manufacturer Dealerships, as \\\\\\\\nrevealed from the Insurance Information Bureau of India (IIBI) database. \\\\\\\\nS. \\\\\\\\nSponsored by \\\\\\\\nOEM name \\\\\\\\nFrom Date \\\\\\\\nTo \\\\\\\\nNo \\\\\\\\nDate \\\\\\\\n1 \\\\\\\\nTVS Insurance Broking Ltd. \\\\\\\\nM&M \\\\\\\\n2nd November, \\\\\\\\n2017 \\\\\\\\n2 \\\\\\\\nSMC Insurance Brokers Pvt Honda \\\\\\\\n3rd \\\\\\\\nNovember, \\\\\\\\nLtd. \\\\\\\\n2017 \\\\\\\\n3 \\\\\\\\nAditya \\\\\\\\nBirla \\\\\\\\nInsurance AL Nissan \\\\\\\\n5th \\\\\\\\nNovember, \\\\\\\\nBrokers Ltd. \\\\\\\\n2017 \\\\\\\\n4 \\\\\\\\nTVS Insurance Broking Ltd. \\\\\\\\nAshok Leyland 29th November, \\\\\\\\nLimited \\\\\\\\n2017 \\\\\\\\n5 \\\\\\\\nNissan \\\\\\\\nRenault \\\\\\\\nFinancial Renault \\\\\\\\n31st May, 2019 Till \\\\\\\\nServices \\\\\\\\nIndia \\\\\\\\nPrivate \\\\\\\\ndate \\\\\\\\nLimited \\\\\\\\n6 \\\\\\\\nVolkswagen \\\\\\\\nFinance \\\\\\\\nPvt.

Therefore, the engagement \\\\\\\\nwith and corresponding payments in the name of 'display of advertisement \\\\\\\\nmaterial' to TVS which was an MISP from 2nd November, 2017 till 31 st December, \\\\\\\\n2019 are in violation of para 15 (5) (d) of MISP Guidelines. \\\\\\\\n2.3.6 The insurer had engaged four automotive dealers namely Indus Motors Co., Pvt. \\\\\\\\nLtd., (Indus) A M Motors, ERAM Motors Pvt. Ltd., (ERAM) and Nippon Motor \\\\\\\\nCorporation Private Ltd (Nippon) for display of advertisement material. As per \\\\\\\\n1181 database, it is noted that Nippon is an MISP sponsored by Toyota Tsusho \\\\\\\\nInsurance Broker India Pvt Ltd since 22nd November, 2017, A M Motors and \\\\\\\\nIndus have been MISPs sponsored by Maruti Insurance Broking Pvt Ltd since \\\\\\\\n22nd November, 2017 and 23rd November, 2017 respectively and ERAM has \\\\\\\\nbeen an MISP sponsored by The Oriental Insurance Co., Ltd, since 30th \\\\\\\\nNovember, 2017. \\\\\\\\n2.3.7 The payments to the above referred four MISPs continued as detailed below: \\\\\\\\nS. No. \\\\\\\\nName of MISP \\\\\\\\nLast payment made \\\\\\\\n1 \\\\\\\\nIndus Motors Co., Pvt., Ltd., \\\\\\\\n18th July, 2018 \\\\\\\\n2 \\\\\\\\nAM Motors \\\\\\\\n21 st May, 2018 \\\\\\\\n3 \\\\\\\\nERAM Motors Pvt., Ltd \\\\\\\\n23rd March, 2018 \\\\\\\\n4 \\\\\\\\nNippon Motor Corp Pvt Ltd \\\\\\\\n11 th April, 2018 \\\\\\\\nTherefore, the engagement with and the corresponding payments in the name of \\\\\\\\n'display of advertisement material' to the four MISPs during the period between \\\\\\\\n22nd November, 2017 to 18th July, 2018 are in violation of para 15 (5) (d) of MISP \\\\\\\\nGuidelines. \\\\\\\\n2.3.8 With regard to payments to designated persons listed in SCN, the insurer has \\\\\\\\nprovided copies of extracts of ledger showing that these payments were made \\\\\\\\nfor activities undertaken for the period prior to 1st November 2017, when MISP \\\\\\\\nGuidelines came into force. There cannot be any objection to receiving payment \\\\\\\\nfor a period prior to the MISP Guidelines. \\\\\\\\nPage 4 of 6\\\\\\\\n2.3.9 It may be appreciated that the objective of MISP Guidelines is to recognize the \\\\\\\\nrole of motor dealers in distributing and servicing motor insurance policies so as \\\\\\\\nto effectively monitor dealer's activities connected to insurance. More \\\\\\\\nimportantly, the guidelines are brought out to check undesirable practices in the \\\\\\\\nmarket like payouts to motor dealers made by insurers at the expense of \\\\\\\\npolicyholders under different heads of management expenses. \\\\\\\\n2.3.10 It is found that the engagement with and payments for 'display of advertisement \\\\\\\\nmaterial' made by the insurer to TVS, A M Motors, Indus, ERAM and Nippon \\\\\\\\nduring the period from 2nd November, 2017 to 31 st December, 2019 are in \\\\\\\\ncontravention of para 15 (5) (d) of the MISP Guidelines. The violation has \\\\\\\\ncontinued for a period of more than 2 years. Therefore, the Authority in exercise \\\\\\\\nof the powers vested under Section 102(b) of the Insurance Act, 1938 imposes a \\\\\\\\npenalty of Rs.1,00,00,000 /- {Rupees one crore only/-). Further, the insurer is \\\\\\\\ndirected to ensure in future that any engagement with automotive dealers is \\\\\\\\nstrictly in compliance with MISP Guidelines. \\\\\\\\n3. \\\\\\\\nCharge no.2: \\\\\\\\n3.1 \\\\\\\\nViolation of para 9 {d) of MISP Guidelines and Section 14 (2) {h) of IRDA Act, \\\\\\\\n1999. As per Section 14 (2) (h) of IRDA Act, 1999, the Insurer has to produce all \\\\\\\\nsuch books of account, registers and other documents in its custody and furnish \\\\\\\\nstatements, information within such time as specified. \\\\\\\\nThe insurer has provided partial data, documents and information to the \\\\\\\\nAuthority. \\\\\\\\n3.2 \\\\\\\\nSummary of Insurer's submissions: \\\\\\\\nThe insurer submitted that the company faced certain difficulties in submission \\\\\\\\nof the information as requisitioned data was not readily available. The insurer \\\\\\\\nfurther stated that they were under impression that some of the entities whose \\\\\\\\ndetails were required were not connected with MISP Guidelines and, hence, the \\\\\\\\ndetails were not submitted. However, during personal hearing, the insurer \\\\\\\\nadmitted that it was a misunderstanding on their part and volunteered to submit \\\\\\\\nthe details. Subsequently, the details were submitted by the insurer vide email \\\\\\\\ndated 21 st December, 2020, though the details were earlier sought to enable the \\\\\\\\ninspection team to examine the same and incorporate appropriate content in the \\\\\\\\ninspection report. \\\\\\\\n3.3 \\\\\\\\nDecision on Charge no.2: \\\\\\\\nThe non-submission of the documents by the insurer to enable proper inspection \\\\\\\\nis viewed seriously and the insurer is hereby directed to ensure prompt submission \\\\\\\\nof information/documents during the course of future inspections. \\\\\\\\nPage 5 of 6\\\\\\\\n4 Summary of Decisions: \\\\\\\\nCharge \\\\\\\\nViolation of Provisions \\\\\\\\nDecision \\\\\\\\nNo. \\\\\\\\n1 \\\\\\\\nGuideline 15 (5) (d) of MISPG \\\\\\\\nPenalty of Rs. \\\\\\\\n1 crore only \\\\\\\\n2 \\\\\\\\nGuideline 9 (d) of MISPG and Section 14 (2) (h) of Direction \\\\\\\\nIRDA Act, 1999 \\\\\\\\nThe penalty amount of Rs.1,00,00,000/- (Rupees one crore only) shall be remitted \\\\\\\\nby the insurer by debiting the shareholders' account within a period of forty-five \\\\\\\\ndays from the date of receipt of this order through NEFT/RTGS (details for which \\\\\\\\nwill be communicated separately).

SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING    4. A Show Cause Notice dated June 13, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued by the erstwhile AO to the Noticees under the provisions of Rule 4 (1) of the Adjudication Rules, to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against the Noticees and why penalty should not be imposed on Noticees under the provisions of Section 15HA of the SEBI Act and Section 15HB of the SEBI Act for the alleged violations stated at para 3 above. The aforesaid SCN was served upon the Noticees.   5. The fact of the case and the allegations made in the SCN are summarised below:  a) The company in its Board Meeting held on September 10, 2011, decided to obtain Inter Corporate Deposits (hereinafter referred to as \"ICDs\") for Rs 1 Crore and Rs 75 Lakhs from Herald Commerce Ltd. and Bahubali Properties Pvt. Ltd. respectively (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201clenders\\\\\\\\u201d). It  is further observed that in the same Board Meeting a resolution was passed to apply and avail loan for meeting business expenses from the following parties: Name of the Party Maximum Loan Amount to be taken Rs Nihita Financial Services Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai 50 lacs Marine Gems Pvt. Ltd., Surat 75 lacs Sanjivani Gems Pvt. Ltd., Surat 25 lacs Bellisima Impex 9.5 Crore Bellisima Impex 50 lacs Balasaria Holdings, Kolkata 1 Crore Adjudication Order w.r.t Alok Jain Tijaria, Vineet Jain Tijaria, Vikas Jain Tijaria, Praveen Jain Tijaria in the matter of IPO of Tijaria Polypipes Ltd.                                                          Page 4 | 28   b) It is observed that the said ICDs constituted approx. 20.8% of the issue size. However, material decision to take ICDs just prior to the date of the Prospectus was not disclosed in the prospectus under the head \\\\\\\\u2018Unsecured Loans\\\\\\\\u2019 filed with ROC. It is also observed that in the prospectus company had mentioned that it did not raise any bridge loan against the proceeds of the present issue. It is further observed that part repayment of the ICDs was done after the receipt of the IPO proceeds. It is also observed that the company had taken amounts from the ICD lender in excess of what was approved in the Board meeting held on September 10, 2011.  c) In the prospectus under the head 'risk factors' the company had stated that there are restrictive covenants in the loan agreement the company has signed with Bank of India for term loan/working capital in which prior written permission of the Bank is to be obtained regarding changes in unsecured loan. However, no such written permission was obtained by the Company from the Bank. Therefore, it is alleged that there was concealment of material information in the prospectus.  d) The Noticees had diverted a substantial part of the IPO proceeds to accounts abroad in form of foreign remittance substantially in favour Shining Stars Implex FZE by placing supply orders with first time suppliers of plant and machinery (namely Shri Nath Trading Co., Neelkant Enterprises, Goyal Trading Co., RK International, VR international and Suvidha International) for which 100% advance was given by the company during the period September 14, 2011 to October, 17, 2011. These suppliers were also not mentioned in the prospectus. It is noted that the suppliers were the first time suppliers of the company. Despite that the company had given 100% advance to them without any agreement. Further, it is also noted that the company did not receive any machinery from the said suppliers as on March 31, 2012. Further, as per Adjudication Order w.r.t Alok Jain Tijaria, Vineet Jain Tijaria, Vikas Jain Tijaria, Praveen Jain Tijaria in the matter of IPO of Tijaria Polypipes Ltd.                                                          Page 5 | 28  the quotation letters of the said suppliers, the plants and machinery were to be supplied within six month time. However, despite the passing of the said period, neither any machinery was received from the said suppliers nor the company received its money back from the suppliers.   e) The six entities mentioned in para 5(d) above, who are shown as suppliers, are in the business of metal/ scrap trading, trading in dry fruits, trading in electronic items. Further, the physical verification of the said suppliers by SEBI revealed that none of the suppliers existed in the addresses provided by the company. It is also observed that the said suppliers are related to each other and have their bank accounts in the same branch of Karur Vyasa Bank.   f) As per the disclosure made in the prospectus, the cost of the expansion cum diversification project was Rs.108.52 Crore and the Rs.60 Crore raised from IPO was to be utilized for this project. However, on perusal of the bank accounts of the company, it is observed that a quantum of IPO proceeds was layered to pay the ICD lenders and the suppliers of the plant and machinery.  g) TPL vide its letter dated August 6, 2012, had informed SEBI that the funds received by way of ICDs were paid back to the ICD holders with interest and TDS was deducted on the interest amounts paid and provided TDS certificates for the same. However, on perusal of the bank accounts of the company, it is observed that full interest payment was made to the ICD lenders without deducting any TDS.   h) The IPO proceeds were layered to provide an exit opportunity to QIBs namely Sparrow Asia Diversified Opportunities Fund, IPRO Funds Ltd and Credo India Thematic Fund Limited and certain retail investors. It is also observed that the noticees had failed to comply with the directions issued in SEBI ad-interim ex-parte order dated December 28, 2011. Adjudication Order w.r.t Alok Jain Tijaria, Vineet Jain Tijaria, Vikas Jain Tijaria, Praveen Jain Tijaria in the matter of IPO of Tijaria Polypipes Ltd.                                                          Page 6 | 28   i) In view of the above, it is alleged that the Noticees have violated Section 12 A(a), 12A(b), 12A(c) of the SEBI Act read with Regulation 3 (a) (b) (c) (d) and 4 (1), 4(2)(a), 4(2)(d) and 4(2)(e) of PFUTP Regulations and Regulations 57(1) and 57(2) read with Schedule VIII, Part A(16) of ICDR Regulations and Regulations 59, 60(4) and 60(7)(a) of the ICDR Regulations.  6. In response to the aforesaid SCN dated June 13, 2013, Noticees submitted their common reply vide letter dated November 4, 2016. Summary of the said reply is as under: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The SCN alleges that the \"decision\" to avail the ICDs was \"material\" and was not disclosed in the prospectus. It is respectfully submitted that the SCN proceeds on a misconception that the Board of Directors in the meeting on September 10, 2011 took any concrete decision to avail of ICDs while the resolution also identified the lenders and the amounts required by the company, it is noteworthy that Mr. Vineet Tijaria was only authorised to negotiate, discuss, settle and finalize terms\" with the lenders. Authorizing Directors of a company to negotiate with third parties are fairly common, routine and are in the ordinary course of business.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It was only subsequently that the negotiations with the lenders fructified and the rate of interest charged by them was found to be acceptable, the company entered in to ICD Agreements and the loans were disbursed. Therefore, absent any concluded arrangements with the lenders, it would have been premature to disclose the same in the Prospectus.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 As regards the allegation that the Prospectus had stated that no bridge loan would be raised against the IPO proceeds, it is submitted that no bridge loans were raised against the proceeds of the issue. As on the date of filing the prospectus, the ICD Agreements were not acted upon and the amounts were availed after the filing of the Prospectus.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The SCN also alleges that the company had obtained amounts in excess of what was contemplated in the resolution dated September 10, 2011. It is respectfully submitted that merely because amounts higher than what was authorized was secured, does not render the transaction itself fraudulent or illegal. If the actions of the company or its representative in dealings with a third party are outside the scope of the authority conferred by way of a resolution passed by the Board of Directors, the same is at best an Adjudication Order w.r.t Alok Jain Tijaria, Vineet Jain Tijaria, Vikas Jain Tijaria, Praveen Jain Tijaria in the matter of IPO of Tijaria Polypipes Ltd.                                                          Page 7 | 28  irregularity not an illegality. In the instant case, assuming for the sake of argument that the company was not authorized to obtain amounts in excess of what was sanctioned by the Board, the company by acting on the loan agreement and repaying the loan amount with interest, has effectively ratified the excess disbursement.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Further in any event, the Board of Directors of the company had been authorized by the way of a special resolution passed by the shareholders on July 12, 2010 to borrow upto Rs.200 Crore. This has been specifically disclosed in the Prospectus under the heading \"Details of Borrowing Powers of Directors\" (Page 149 of Prospectus).  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Regarding the ICDs availed from M/s. Herald Commerce Ltd (Rs. 1 crore) and Bahubali Properties Private Ltd (Rs.75 lakhs), the loan was repaid with interest and tax was deducted at source. These loans were availed for the purpose of meeting working capital requirement in the ordinary and usual course of business. The company was of the view that the loan transaction had no impact on its operations and this was the view of the merchant banker too who did not even bother to verify any further after the discussions. Therefore they were not disclosed in the Prospectus. The SCN alleges that no resolution of the Board was passed for obtaining these loans. It is submitted that this is wholly irrelevant as these loans agreements have been acted upon and repaid the loan with interest.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The Allegation that TDS was not deducted on the interest component of ICDs is baseless. In order to substantiate this allegation, SEBI relies on a communication dated August 8, 2012 where the company has stated that owing to oversight in the accounts department, TDS was not deducted but has subsequently been paid to the Government. In any event, TDS has been paid on the interest component of the ICDs and a copy of the TDS certificate is attached herein as \"Annexure C\". The company had also filed a civil suit against the lenders for nonpayment of tax which the company was compelled to pay. In some of the cases, a decree has also been passed by the civil court directing some of the lenders to reimburse the company for the same. A copy of the same is attached and annexed herein as \"Annexure IY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The SCN alleges that the Prospectus disclosed the existence of restrictive covenants that the company had entered into with the Bank of India that envisaged prior written permission of the bank for obtaining term loan/working capital loan. According to SEBI, these were not adhered to when availing ICDs. The allegation is wholly misconceived and without basis. The SCN does not even state which provision of SEBI Act or rules or regulations issued has been violated as a result of breaching the covenants Adjudication Order w.r.t Alok Jain Tijaria, Vineet Jain Tijaria, Vikas Jain Tijaria, Praveen Jain Tijaria in the matter of IPO of Tijaria Polypipes Ltd.                                                          Page 8 | 28  with Bank of India. In fact, there is not even a remote nexus let alone a reasonable one, between breach of a contractual obligation and the provisions of the PFUTP Regulations and the ICDR Regulations that the SCN has invoked against the Noticees. It would be manifestly absurd to suggest that a breach of contract entered into with a lender constitutes either a fraudulent dealing in securities - the very basis tor a charge under PFUTP Regulations; or a non-disclosure of material facts to an investor under the ICDR Regulations when admittedly disclosures have been made regarding the existence of the contractual obligation in the prospectus under the section dealing with \"Risk Factors\". A Risk Factor by its very nature is susceptible to uncertainties. Therefore, the mere fact that the entity has breached a disclosed contractual obligation, does not ipso facto, render the disclosure fraudulent or misleading. On the contrary, the non-disclosure of the restrictive covenant in the Prospectus would have been misleading.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In any event, the SCN does not explain the nexus between breach of a restrictive covenant disclosed in the Prospectus and its nexus with the charges under the PFUTP Regulations and the ICDR Regulations. On this ground alone, the allegations ought to be disregarded as being extraneous and irrelevant.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The allegation that the proceeds of the IPO had been diverted to non-genuine suppliers and the company has not received any machinery is erroneous and is based on the site visit conducted by SEBI officials in March, 2012. This allegation is set aside by the Hon'ble Tribunal.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The machinery was received in June, 2012 and the reasons for delay in installation were also explained to SEBI via letter dated June 22, 2012. We had stated that owing to the directions in the Ex-Parte Order, the construction of the building was delayed and we had requested the suppliers to retain the machinery pending completion of the construction of the factory. A certificate of Chartered Engineer was also provided with our letter dated February 28, 2013 certifying the installation of the machinery in the factory premises to demonstrate that we had received the machinery. We also requested SEBI to conduct a visit of the premises and test the veracity of the claims made by TPL. However, SEBI did not take cognizance of that and decided to stick to their arguments based solely on their Investigation Report.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It appears that SEBI has sought to question the genuineness of the suppliers based on a visit by SEBI officials to the premises of the suppliers in July, 2012 based on the addresses provided by these suppliers in their KYC form to Karur Vyasa Bank. We had vide our letter dated August 6, 2012, at the Adjudication Order w.r.t Alok Jain Tijaria, Vineet Jain Tijaria, Vikas Jain Tijaria, Praveen Jain Tijaria in the matter of IPO of Tijaria Polypipes Ltd.                                                          Page 9 | 28  request of SEBI, also provided the addresses of these suppliers as their addresses had changed. SEBI has made no effort at investigating and verifying the claims made by us and visiting the premises of the suppliers at the addresses provided by us.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 We are constrained to state that no response was forthcoming from SEBI which indicates existence of a predisposed mind that is not expected from a regulator required to discharge its quasi-judicial functions in a fair, impartial and objective manner.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It was also held by the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal that the direction given by the Whole Time Member to call back advance paid for orders of plant and machinery need not be complied with as the orders were genuinely placed by the company and the machinery too was received. SEBI cannot arrive at a conclusion that the plant and machinery had not been received from the said suppliers and direct the company to call back the amount paid for procurement of machinery without verifying the aforesaid facts.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The allegations in para 9 and para 11 of the Adjudication Show Cause Notice dated June 13, 2013 are wholly misconceived and without basis. An allegation that IPO proceeds were layered to pay ICD lenders and suppliers of plant and machinery and to provide an exit opportunity to QIBs and certain retail investors is of very serious nature. However, as stated earlier, all these entities are independent third parties and we have no connection whatsoever with these entities including whether by the way of common directorships or shareholding nor do we have any ability to manage or control the activities or dealings of these entities. The transactions with these entities were legitimate commercial transactions. Therefore, the company cannot be called upon to answer for dealings of an independent third party and what use it has put its fund to. If it is the case of SEBI that the allegations are substantiated in other parallel proceedings, we crave leave to refer to the decisions of the Supreme Court in Orix Fisheries where the Hon'ble Court has held the nature and the scope of the notice which the noticee has to defend. Mere a mention of allegation is not sufficient and it is a settled position of law. In case, the learned Adjudicating Officer decides to proceed further and inquire into this allegation of alleged layering of funds by our company, there ought to be an explanation and necessary facts mentioned to us which we will be dealing with separately as submitted during the personal hearing. Adjudication Order w.r.t Alok Jain Tijaria, Vineet Jain Tijaria, Vikas Jain Tijaria, Praveen Jain Tijaria in the matter of IPO of Tijaria Polypipes Ltd.                                                          Page 10 | 28  7. Pursuant to receipt of SCN, the Noticees made multiple requests for inspection of relevant documents in the matter. Accordingly, opportunities of inspection of documents were provided to the Noticees on July 26, 2013, August 7, 2013 and September 5, 2013. In the interest of natural justice and in order to conduct an inquiry in terms of Rule 4 (3) of the Adjudication Rules, hearing opportunities was provided to the Noticees by the erstwhile AO on August 23, 2016, September 21, 2016 and October 6, 2016. Subsequently, upon receipt of the case, the undersigned provided further opportunity of personal hearing to the Noticees on November 23, 2020 through video conferencing on the Webex platform.  In this regard, the Authorised Representative of the Noticees attended hearing before me on November 23, 2020 and requested to submit additional reply within 10days time. However, till date, the Authorised Representative has not submitted any post hearing reply before me.  8. Taking into account the aforesaid facts, I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been followed in the matter by granting the Noticees opportunity of being heard and submit their reply in the matter. Therefore, I deem it appropriate to decide the matter on the basis of facts/material available on record.   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES, EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS  9. I have taken into consideration the facts and material available on record. I observe that the allegation levelled against the Noticees is that they have violated various provisions of SEBI Act, SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003 and ICDR Regulations.    After perusal of the material available on record, I have the following issues for consideration, viz.  I. Whether Noticees have violated Section 12 A(a), 12A(b), 12A(c) of the SEBI Act read with Regulation 3 (a) (b) (c) (d) and 4 (1), 4(2)(a), 4(2)(d) and 4(2)(e) of Adjudication Order w.r.t Alok Jain Tijaria, Vineet Jain Tijaria, Vikas Jain Tijaria, Praveen Jain Tijaria in the matter of IPO of Tijaria Polypipes Ltd.                                                          Page 11 | 28  PFUTP Regulations and Regulations 57(1) and 57(2) read with Schedule VIII, Part A(16) of ICDR Regulations and Regulations 59, 60(4) and 60(7)(a) of the ICDR Regulations?  II. Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 15 HA of SEBI Act and Section 15HB of the SEBI Act for the Noticees?  III. If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?   10. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant regulatory provisions which reads as under:   Relevant provisions of SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003: 3.

The request made by the Noticee was accepted and it was also decided to postpone the inspection to the FY 2016-17. Thereafter, vide email dated July 14, 2016, a reminder was sent to the Noticee for submitting the information sought by SEBI.

It was observed that KCGP is not active in the market; on the other hand, KCGP has failed to produce books of accounts to inspecting authority. Further, no books of accounts and records were found in its registered office which implies that the broker is not preserving those documents. KCGP also failed to give all assistance in connection with the inspection to the inspecting authority.  5. Subsequent to this, an enquiry proceeding under the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Enquiry by Enquiry Officer and Imposing Penalty) Regulations, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cEnquiry Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) was initiated against the Noticee to enquire into the violations of SEBI Act/Rules/Regulations/Circulars and provisions of SCRA and SCRR.

Based on the above, SEBI initiated enquiry proceedings against the Noticee under Chapter V of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 (\"Intermediaries Regulations\") and appointed a Designated Authority (\"DA\") to enquire into alleged violations of the Noticee.  7. Upon completion of the enquiry, an Enquiry Report (DA\\\\\\\\u2019s Report) dated March 18, 2020, was submitted by the DA to the Designated Member (\\\\\\\\u201cDM\\\\\\\\u201d) recommending that the Certificate of Registration of the Noticee be cancelled.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KCGP Share Broking Services Pvt. Ltd.             Page 4 of 10 8. Pursuant to this, a post enquiry SCN(P-SCN) dated July 02, 2020 was issued to the Noticee, under Regulation 28 (1) of SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008, to show cause as to why action, as recommended by the DA or any other action as considered appropriate should not be taken against the Noticee.  A copy of the DA\\\\\\\\u2019s Report was also forwarded to the Noticee along with an advice to file reply, if any, within 21 days from the date of receipt of the notice.  9. The Noticee was given an opportunity of personal hearing on January 06, 2021, wherein the Noticee was represented by Mr. Vikas Bengani, Advocate. Subsequent to this, Noticee vide email dated January 16, 2021 submitted written submissions and the document sought from the Noticee during the hearing held on January 06, 2021. The main submissions made on behalf of the Noticee are as under,- i. Noticee is more than a 100-year-old firm and was a founding member of the Calcutta Stock Exchange. ii. Noticee has never defaulted in its obligations to the stock exchange. iii. The stock exchange or SEBI has not received a single investor complaint against the Noticee till date nor has any adverse orders been passed against the Noticee.  iv. Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s broking business is at a standstill from January, 2015.  v. Since CSE is not a vibrant platform for trading in shares and securities like NSE and BSE, the Noticee was not having much of a client base. Client base of the Noticee was 34 as of January, 2015.  vi. Noticee was providing broking business for cash segment only. Therefore, there was no issue of collecting margin requirement on daily basis like in Derivatives Segment.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KCGP Share Broking Services Pvt. Ltd.             Page 5 of 10 vii. Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s Director cum Compliance Officer could not assist the inspection team in February, 2016 as his son fell down from third floor of his building and he had suffered severe injuries in his body. His son at that time was only 8 years old and required full attention and care for next 2 years to cure.  viii. Despite the broking business being halted and the treatment of the son of Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s Director cum Compliance Officer being ongoing, when SEBI once again in July, 2016 sought inspection of the documents, Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s Director cum Compliance Officer after initially expressing his inability to attend the same due to the ongoing treatment of his son, later agreed to be present during the inspection on 26-07-2016. ix. During the course of inspection on 26-07-2016, the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s Compliance Officer provided all the requisite documents as asked by the team and further assured to the concerned officer to provide more requisite documents. The remaining requisite documents had been provided to the concerned officer vide email dated 27-07-2016. x. Since the Noticee was having only a small client base and not having huge turnover, they had no hesitation in providing the requisite documents to the inspection team.  xi. Noticee denied the observations made in the inspection report that the lighting system in their office was poor, that they had no compliance officer, no system in place, no books of accounts, no investor grievances mechanism etc.  xii. It was submitted that the Noticee had no employees at the time of inspection as they were not having any business at that time. Mr. Suraj Jhunjhunwala was, however, the Compliance Officer of the Noticee and the observation in the inspection report that the Noticee had no compliance officer is not factually correct. The Noticee also submitted copies of the communication with CSE__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KCGP Share Broking Services Pvt. Ltd.             Page 6 of 10 wherein they have informed the exchange that Mr. Jhunjhunwala was the compliance officer of the Noticee.  xiii. It was submitted that most of the books of accounts were kept in the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s computer system and the rest which were maintained physically were made available to the inspection team. xiv. Noticee submitted that the firm had a proper accounting system even if it was not as sophisticated as those kept by big broking firms. All the books are maintained using the software CBOS.  xv. It was further submitted that they had properly maintained Investors Grievances Redressal System. It was pointed out that SEBI and/or Exchange did not receive any Investor Complaint against the Noticee.  xvi. It was also submitted that vide Email dated 27-07-2016, the Noticee had provided requisite details as asked by the inspection team. It was further submitted that after a few days from the date of the completion of the inspection, Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s director cum Compliance Officer called the concerned SEBI officer over phone and asked him to let him know if any more documents are required. On phone, the Officer did not ask any further details or documents and assured that if any additional information was required, he would inform the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s Compliance Officer. xvii. The Inspection Team comprising of three officers had duly inspected the following documents:- a. All KYC Documents b. Books of Accounts in our Computer System for F. Y. 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. c. Contract Notes Files. d. AML Policy__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KCGP Share Broking Services Pvt. Ltd.             Page 7 of 10 e. Client Due Diligence reports f. Payment methods g. Compliance function reports h. Quarterly settlement reports were in the software in our Computer. i. Complaint Register/categorized Investor complaint register j. Top Ten clients list as per turnover k. Top ten Scrips list as per turnover l. Bank Statements of all banks. m. Demat account statement xviii. It was further submitted that prior to the inspection conducted by the team of SEBI, the CSE had inspected the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s accounts for two years i.e. 2013 - 2014 and 2014-2015 and did not find any fault with their accounting system. There was no adverse finding against the Company by the CSE.  xix. It was also submitted by the Noticee that the IA did not bring on record the complete details of the documents submitted by the Noticee. Further, SEBI has failed to provide any evidence such as photographs or video recording etc. to establish that the Noticee was having inadequate lighting, poor infrastructure, etc.  xx. The Noticee further requested for the screenshot of email inbox of the member of the SEBI inspection to whom they had submitted the information on July 27, 2016.  10. I have considered the Report submitted by the DA, the Post-Enquiry SCN issued to the Noticee, oral and written submissions of the Noticee along with the documents contained therein and other material available on record. I note that the issues that arise for consideration in the present matter stem from,- a. the alleged failure of the Noticee to furnish information sought by SEBI vide a questionnaire, and__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KCGP Share Broking Services Pvt. Ltd.             Page 8 of 10 b. the non-compliances observed during the inspection conducted by SEBI.  11. I note that the Noticee has vehemently contested all observations regarding the non-compliance with various regulatory provisions that was brought out in the inspection report and has also stated that they had submitted all the required information sought by SEBI.  12. I note that Regulation 21 of the Stock Brokers Regulations cast an obligation on the stock broker who is being inspected to produce to the Inspecting Authority such books, accounts and other documents in his custody or control, and furnish information relating to the transactions in securities market within such time as the said officer may require.  Further, stock brokers are mandated to allow the Inspecting Authority to have reasonable access to its premises and also extend reasonable facility for examining any books, records, etc.  in its possession and also provide copies of documents relevant to the Inspecting Authority.  The stock broker is also mandated to provide all necessary assistance in connection with the inspection. The obligations imposed under Regulation 21 also extends to every director, proprietor, partner, officer and employee of the stock broker. 13. I note from the inspection report that it was observed by the SEBI inspection team that the Noticee was not having adequate infrastructure to run the stock broking business. In this regard, it was contented by the Noticee that its business had come to a standstill in January 2015 and that was the reason why there was no staff present at its office at the time of the inspection. It was confirmed by CSE, vide email dated October 3, 2017, that KCGP last traded on January 14, 2015. I further note that the Noticee is a member only of the Calcutta Stock Exchange, where at the time the inspection, there was no trading happening due to issues surrounding its de-recognition by SEBI and consequent litigation. Under such circumstances, I note that it cannot be expected from a stock broker who is exclusively a member of CSE to maintain adequate infrastructure as is normally expected__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KCGP Share Broking Services Pvt. Ltd.             Page 9 of 10 out of a functional stock broker. However, the status of the recognition of the exchange being in uncertainty cannot be a defence for not maintaining the documents and other records for the period they were active in the market, as required under the SEBI regulations, and for non-production of the same during inspections conducted by SEBI. In view of the same, I am in agreement with the findings of the DA that the Noticee has not complied with the requirements under Regulations 21(1), 21(2) and 21(4) of the Stock Brokers Regulations.    14. As regards, the information sought vide the questionnaire by SEBI, I note from the information available on record that the Noticee has substantially provided the information sought. I further note that the allegation that the Noticee did not have a compliance officer does not stand as the Noticee had submitted copies of its communication with CSE prior to the date of the SEBI inspection wherein it had intimated the exchange that Mr. Jhunjhunwala is acting as the Compliance Officer of the Noticee.  15. In view of the above, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the instant proceedings, I find that the action as recommended by the Designated Authority is not commensurate with the defaults, non-compliances, contraventions and violations committed by the Noticee.    Order \\\\\\\\u2013 16. I, in exercise of powers conferred under Section 19 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 read with Regulation 28(2) of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008, hereby issue a warning to the Noticee /KCGP Share Broking Services Pvt.

In re: Violations of provisions of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015  In respect of:  SCN SEBI/HO/IVD/ID16/OW/P/2020/7039/1 dated February 24, 2020 \\\\\\\\u2013 SCN-1 SCN SEBI/HO/IVD/ID16/OW/P/2020/7031/1 dated February 24, 2020 \\\\\\\\u2013 SCN-2  Noticee No. for the purpose of order  Name of the Entity  PAN 1 Mr. Pereira Sebastian Ruzario  AEWPP4711R 2 Mr. Harshavardhan Panigrahi AKTPP1644A  1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) was in receipt of an examination report from NSE in the matter of Marksans Pharma Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cMPL/Company\\\\\\\\u201d) wherein certain entities were shortlisted for suspected insider trading. During further examination by SEBI, it was also observed that certain employees of MPL, who were also \\\\\\\\u201cdesignated persons\\\\\\\\u201d of MPL, had executed contra trades in violation of Clause 10 of the Code of Conduct specified in the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPIT Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d).  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 2 of 44  2. Thereafter, the matter was taken up for further detailed investigation to determine whether there was any violation of the Code of Conduct or disclosure requirements in terms of the PIT Regulations by Noticee No. 1. The period of investigation is from May 31, 2015, to December 31, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period/ IP\\\\\\\\u201d). During the investigation period, it was observed that Noticee No. 2 was the Compliance Officer of MPL. Pursuant to the investigation, two separate Show Cause Notices (SCNs) dated February 24, 2020, were issued to both the Noticees  Brief allegations in the SCN issued to Noticee No. 1:  3. As per the approved Code of Conduct of MPL formulated by MPL under Regulation 9 of the PIT Regulations and applicable during the investigation period, Noticee No. 1 was a designated person during the investigation period. Hence, the following clause of the Code of Conduct was applicable to Noticee No. 1:  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026trading by Designated persons and their immediate relatives, even when trading window is open, shall be subject to pre-clearance by the Compliance Officer if the value of the proposed trade whether in one transaction or in a series of transactions over any calendar quarter will aggregate in excess of Rs. 10 lacs.\\\\\\\\u201d  4. As the value of trading done by the Noticee No. 1 during the calendar quarters July-September 2015, October-December 2015 and October-December 2016, exceeded the threshold value of Rs. 10 lakhs on various occasions, he was required to take pre-clearance for those trades from the Compliance Officer of MPL, which he failed to do in violation of the Code of Conduct of MPL as well as Clause 6 of Schedule B read with Regulation 9(1) of the PIT Regulations.   5. As per the trade log of Noticee No. 1, in twenty instances during the investigation  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 3 of 44  period, his trading in the scrip of MPL had crossed the threshold of Rs. 10 lakhs in a calendar quarter, for which disclosure was required to be made in terms of Regulation 7(2)(a) of the PIT Regulations to the Company. However, no such disclosures were made by Noticee No. 1 to the Company.  6. As per the Code of Conduct of MPL, framed pursuant to Clause 10 of Schedule B read with Regulation 9(1) of the PIT Regulations, the company has provided a period of 6 months during which a person shall not execute a Contra trade. Further, as per Clause 10 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 9(1) of the PIT Regulations, profit arising out of such contra trades are liable to be disgorged for remittance to the Board for credit to the Investor Protection and Education Fund (IPEF).   7. From a perusal of the trading data of Noticee No. 1, as per the trade logs received from NSE and BSE, it is observed that he had entered into 71 contra trades during the investigation period and made a profit of Rs. 6,49,624.09/- MPL, vide letter dated July 10, 2017, had informed the Noticee that the amount of profit earned from contra trades is Rs. 19,51,620.59/- and the same has to be deposited with the Investor Protection and Education Fund. Vide letter dated August 28, 2017, MPL had sent a reminder to Noticee No. 1 for depositing the aforesaid amount with the company for remitting to SEBI-IPEF and informing him that he has been debarred from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in shares of MPL either by himself or through his immediate relative.  8. However, the profits earned through contra trades by Noticee No.1 have not yet been disgorged and transferred to the SEBI-IPEF.  9. In view of the above, it is alleged that Noticee No. 1, being a designated person  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 4 of 44  of MPL, has (a) not obtained pre-clearances from the compliance officer of MPL for trades in the scrip of MPL which have exceeded Rs. 10 lakhs during certain calendar quarters, (b) not disclosed his trades in the scrip of MPL which have exceeded the threshold of Rs. 10 lakhs in a calendar quarter and (c) undertaken contra trades and not disgorged the profits earned from contra-trades executed in the scrip of MPL.  Brief allegations in the SCN issued to Noticee No. 2:  10. It was observed during the investigation period that in twenty (20) instances the trading of Noticee No. 1 in the scrip of MPL crossed the threshold of Rs. 10 lakhs in a calendar quarter and disclosure for these trades was required to be made by Noticee No. 1 in terms of Regulation 7(2)(a) of the PIT Regulations. Further, MPL was required to make disclosures w.r.t. the same to the Exchange(s) on becoming aware of the transaction(s), in terms of Regulation 7(2)(b) of the PIT Regulations.   11. Vide email dated November 18, 2019, information was sought from the RTA of MPL, Bigshare Services Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cRTA\\\\\\\\u201d) regarding the policy of the RTA for submission of BENPOS/ shareholding/ transaction details of the promoters/ employees/ designated persons of MPL to the company during the period May 01, 2015, to December 31, 2016. The RTA further informed that all the reports were sent through email to the email ID of the Company Secretary and Compliance Officer of MPL.   12. It is alleged that MPL became aware of Noticee No. 1, through the weekly data, crossing the threshold of Rs. 10 lakhs four (04) times during the investigation period for which disclosure was required to be made by MPL in terms of Regulation 7(2)(b) of the PIT Regulations. BSE and NSE, vide emails dated  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 5 of 44  November 20, 2019, have confirmed that they have not received any disclosures from MPL under Regulation 7(2)(b) of the PIT Regulations for the transactions done by Noticee No. 1 in the scrip of MPL for the said instances.  13. As per the PIT Regulations, the Compliance Officer is required to administer the Code of Conduct formulated by a company and hence, monitor trading by their designated persons as per Regulation 9(3) of the PIT Regulations. In view of the above, it is alleged that Noticee No. 2 did not make disclosures to the exchanges in respect of the transactions of Noticee No. 1, even though he was aware of the same.  Service of SCNs, Personal Hearing and Submissions of Noticees:  14. I note that the SCNs have been duly delivered to the Noticees. I note that Noticee No. 1 has replied vide email dated May 05, 2020, while Noticee No. 2 has replied vide letter dated March 09, 2020. While Noticee No. 2 sought a personal hearing in the matter, no such request was made by Noticee No. 1; however, in the interest of natural justice, an opportunity of personal hearing on July 09, 2020, was granted to both the Noticees. Both the Noticees attended the hearing personally and reiterated their submissions made earlier. Pursuant to the hearing, no additional submissions have been received from Noticee No. 1, while Noticee No. 2 provided certain submissions vide his email dated July 09, 2020.  15. The submissions made by Noticee No. 1 are as below:   15.1. Regarding the shares I had bought in the year 2016 and had made a loss by all the shares were squared off from my account, I have not made any profit.  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 6 of 44  15.2. I am not aware of any rules and regulations of the company for share trading, all my shares I had bought in the year 2016. 15.3. I am very sorry for hurting the company for all the problem due to me, was faced by the company. Due to this, the company had issue me a letter that all my increments, LTA and promotion is stopped, from last six years.  15.4. I have my family along with my old age parents living along with them, I have no future for my children, I request you kindly have mercy on me, I beg.  16. It was observed that during the investigation Noticee No. 2 had submitted that the administration department of MPL had circulated the Code of Conduct to all the employees through e-mails and it was also displayed on the notice board and website of the Company for information of the employees. At the relevant time under reference, E-mail ID of Noticee No. 1 was not in the records of MPL and hence, he was informed about the Code through the notice board and website. This submission of Noticee No. 2 was provided to Noticee No. 1 for his comments and he was also provided another opportunity of hearing, if he so desired. Vide letter dated January 21, 2021, Noticee No. 1 submitted the following:   16.1. It is correct that the Code of Conduct is available on the company website and notices/ intimations are displayed on the notice board for information of employees. 16.2. He does not recall having seen the Code of Conduct on the notice board or website at that time, by oversight.  No submissions were made by him as regards another personal hearing.  17. The submissions made by Noticee No. 2 to the SCN and pursuant to hearing are as below:  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 7 of 44  17.1. We deny and do not admit that Noticee No. 2 has violated Regulation 7(2)(b) read with Regulation 9(3) of the PIT Regulations by not making disclosures to the exchange in respect of the transactions of Mr. Pereira, as Noticee No. 2 was not aware of the same. Noticee No. 2 was not aware of the transactions of Mr. Pereira crossing the threshold of Rs. 10 lakh during the given quarters as alleged.  17.2. It is true that the RTA of MPL provides weekly BENPOS and BENPOS as at the end of every quarter. These reports run into hundreds of pages and the company had 574 employees during year 2015-16 and 717 employees during year 2016-17. It is quite impossible to track each and every employee\\\\\\\\u2019s trading in the scrip of MPL. Therefore, as mentioned earlier trading in the shares by Promoters, Directors and KMPs and employees upto Manager level and employees in the accounts, taxation, treasury, finance, legal and secretarial department in the corporate office of MPL are specifically tracked on weekly basis to ensure compliance of the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s Insider Trading Code of Conduct. Other employees including peons are excluded from weekly tracking. Additionally, transactions involving 1,00,000 shares or more are also specifically monitored on regular basis.  17.3. Under the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s Insider Trading Code of Conduct, all employees of the Company are asked to give their shareholding as at the end of each quarter and also their trading details during the quarter, irrespective of the number of shares involved on quarterly basis. In the present case also, Noticee No. 1 should have given his shareholding as at the end of every quarter as well as buy and sale details during the quarter which he has not done. Further, when his total dealings in a quarter exceeds threshold of Rs. 10 lakhs, he should have obtained pre-clearance from the Noticee and  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 8 of 44  should have informed the trading details which also he did not. He has even not mentioned either verbally or otherwise about his trading in the shares of MPL. Whereas other employees have been disclosing their shareholding regularly and on employee shareholder who sold his shares which crossed the threshold, obtained pre-clearance as well disclosed his sale which MPL intimated to the stock exchanges. Copies of the same are attached.  17.4. It is practically not possible on part of Noticee No. 2 to maintain every week\\\\\\\\u2019s trading data of each and every employee across a calendar quarter to ascertain whether cumulative transaction has crossed the threshold. Onus is always on the employee to seek pre-clearance and also to inform trading in case it exceeds the threshold limit of Rs. 10 lakhs.  17.5. Noticee No. 1 has once disclosed his shareholding of only 500 shares in the Company while proposing candidature of a person for the office of director of MPL under the Companies Act. Copy of such proposal is enclosed.   17.6. Noticee No. 2 has always acted in good faith believing its employees.  17.7. MPL/ Noticee No. 2 became aware of the transactions of Noticee No. 1 only when SEBI provided his transaction details. Even at this time also MPL/ Noticee No. 2 could not file the disclosure with the stock exchanges as the information was not complete for filing. On receipt of trading details from SEBI, Noticee No. 1 has been asked time and again to provide relevant data, which he has failed to provide till date. Due to non-availability of complete information, Noticee No. 2 has not been able to file required disclosure with the exchanges.  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 9 of 44  17.8. MPL has taken stern action against Noticee No. 1 by suspending his yearly salary increment, bonus and LTA payment since the year 2016-17 till the case will be disposed of. Further, MPL has deposited a sum of Rs. 67,170/- towards annual salary increment, bonus and LTA of Noticee No. 1 for the year 2016-17 into the SEBI IPEF. MPL has also permanently debarred Noticee No. 1 from dealing in shares of MPL.  17.9. In view of the aforesaid, it was quite impossible for MPL/ Noticee No. 2 to have knowledge of trading of Noticee No. 1 in the shares of MPL, when there was no pre-clearance sought nor disclosure made and therefore, it is incorrect to say that Noticee No. 2 was aware of the transactions. The onus of seeking pre-clearance and disclosure is always on the employee as it is not possible for MPL/ Noticee No. 2 to imagine any possible transaction by any employee requiring pre-clearance.  17.10. Even if Noticee No. 2 violated Regulation 7(2)(b) read with Regulation 9(3) of the PIT Regulations by not making disclosure to the stock exchanges, as alleged, though not admitted, the violation, if any, is technical in nature and unintentional. It is just a procedural lapse. There is no mala fide intention and no mens rea involved. Further, no gain or advantage of any nature has occurred to Noticee No. 1 and no loss or harm caused to any investors. Therefore, violation, if any, is pardonable.  17.11. Noticee No. 2 requests to view the matter with leniency and withdraw the SCN.  Issues for Consideration and Findings:  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 10 of 44  18. I have considered the allegations of the SCN, submissions made by the Noticees and the material available on record. The following issues arise for consideration and each is dealt with separately under different headings.  18.1. Issue No. 1: Whether Noticee No. 1 has (a) failed to take pre-clearance for his trades in the scrip of MPL that have exceeded the threshold value during certain quarters, (b) failed to disclose the trades in the scrip of MPL that have crossed the threshold during certain quarters and (c) entered into contra-trades, in violation of the provisions charged in SCN?   18.2. Issue No. 2: Whether Noticee No. 2 (a) had adequate access to information regarding the transactions of Noticee No. 1 and (b) despite having adequate access to information regarding the same, he has failed to discharge his responsibilities, in violation of the provisions charged in SCN?   18.3. Issue No. 3: If the answer to Issues No. 1 and/ or 2 are affirmative, what directions, if any, should be issued against the Noticees?  Issue No. 1: Whether Noticee No. 1 has (a) failed to take pre-clearance for his trades in the scrip of MPL that have exceeded the threshold value during certain quarters, (b) failed to disclose the trades in the scrip of MPL that have crossed the threshold during certain quarters and (c) entered into contra-trades, in violation of the provisions charged in SCN?  19. I note that the following allegations have been levelled against Noticee No. 1:  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 11 of 44  19.1. He was a designated person as per the Code of Conduct of MPL. 19.2. While being a designated person, has failed to take pre-clearance from the Compliance Officer of MPL for his trades in the scrip of MPL which have exceeded the threshold value of Rs. 10 lakhs on various occasions.  19.3. He has also not disclosed the above-mentioned trades to MPL. 19.4. While being a designated person, has entered into 71 contra trades during the investigation period and the profit earned from these contra trades is Rs. 6,49,624/- and the same was not deposited in IEPF   20. I note here that as per the Code of Conduct of MPL formulated by the company under Regulation 9 of the PIT Regulations and approved by its Board of Directors on May 30, 2015, Clause 3(g)(iv) states that \\\\\\\\u201cAll Employees in the Accounts, Taxation, Treasury, Finance, Legal and Secretarial Departments of the Company and in the Corporate Office.\\\\\\\\u201d come under the definition of a \\\\\\\\u201cDesignated Person\\\\\\\\u201d.  21. Vide letter dated June 30, 2017, MPL has communicated to SEBI that Noticee No. 1 is a designated person of MPL. Vide email dated July 18, 2019, MPL has confirmed that during the investigation period, Noticee No. 1 was Head Office Assistant (Head Peon). I note that Noticee No. 1 has not made any submissions regarding his status as a designated person of MPL and therefore, in view of the material available on record, I find that during the investigation period, Noticee No. 1 was a designated person of MPL and was therefore, required to comply with the provisions of the Code of Conduct formulated by MPL.  22. The defense of Noticee No. 1 for the allegations leveled against him is that he was unaware of the rules and regulations of MPL regarding trading in the scrip of the Company. I note that Noticee No. 1 has, vide his own submissions dated November 22, 2019, accepted that he has traded in multiple scrips, including the  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 12 of 44  scrip of MPL and as such, he is not a novice or is not new to trading in the securities markets. Further, Noticee No. 1 has also confirmed that he was aware that the Code of Conduct was available on the website of MPL and that notices/ intimations are placed on the notice board for information of employees. In view of the same, I cannot accept his submission that he was not aware of the Code of Conduct of MPL or that due to oversight he had not seen the Code of Conduct on the website/ notice board. The Code of Conduct of MPL clearly mentioned that persons working in the corporate office are designated persons and has also laid out the nature of the disclosures to be made by them. There is also no dispute that Noticee No. 1 was working in the corporate office.   23. I note here the following provisions of the SEBI Act and the PIT Regulations:  Code of Conduct.   9. (1) The board of directors of every listed company and market intermediary shall formulate a code of conduct to regulate, monitor and report trading by its employees and other connected persons towards achieving compliance with these regulations, adopting the minimum standards set out in Schedule B to these regulations, without diluting the provisions of these regulations in any manner.  SCHEDULE B [See sub-regulation (1) and sub-regulation (2) of regulation 9] Minimum Standards for Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Insiders  1\\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 6. When the trading window is open, trading by designated persons shall be subject to pre-clearance by the compliance officer, if the value of the proposed trades is above such thresholds as the board of directors may stipulate. No designated person shall apply for pre-clearance of any proposed trade if such designated person is in possession of unpublished price sensitive information even if the trading window is not closed.  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 13 of 44  Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided.   Section 15HB.   Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees.  24. Investigation has revealed that the trading of Noticee No. 1 in the scrip of MPL has crossed the threshold of Rs. 10 lakhs during the calendar quarters of July-September 2015, October-December 2015 and October-December 2016. As per the Code of Conduct of MPL and Clause 6 of Schedule B read with Regulation 9(1) of the PIT Regulations, the trading of a designated person in the scrip of MPL shall be subject to pre-clearance from the Compliance Officer if the value of the proposed trade, whether in one transaction or in a series of transactions over a calendar quarter aggregate in excess of Rs. 10 lacs. I note that Noticee No. 1 has submitted that he had purchased these shares in 2015 and was not aware of any rules and regulations of MPL. He has also accepted that he has bought/ sold these shares without telling the Company. The Compliance Officer of MPL has also submitted that Noticee No. 1 has not taken pre-clearance from MPL for the trades executed in these quarters. I note that the details of these instances were provided in the SCN to Noticee No. 1 and he has not disputed the same. Hence, in view of the same, I hold that the Noticee No. 1, while being a designated person, failed to take pre-clearance from the Compliance Officer of MPL for his trades in the scrip of MPL, which have exceeded the threshold value of Rs. 10 lakhs on various occasions.  25. Hence, in view of finding mentioned above, I find that Noticee No. 1 is in violation of the Code of Conduct of MPL as well as Clause 6 of Schedule B read with  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.

Moving ahead, I note the following provisions of the SEBI Act and the PIT Regulations:  Disclosures by certain persons. 7 (1)\\\\\\\\u2026 7 (2) Continual Disclosures. (a) Every promoter, employee and director of every company shall disclose to the company the number of such securities acquired or disposed of within two trading days of such transaction if the value of the securities traded, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions over any calendar quarter, aggregates to a traded value in excess of ten lakh rupees or such other value as may be specified;  Section 15A  If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder,\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) \\\\\\\\u2026 (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations or who furnishes or files false, incorrect or incomplete information, return, report, books or other documents, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees;  27. Investigation has revealed that the trading of Noticee No. 1 in the scrip of MPL has crossed the threshold of Rs. 10 lakhs in 20 instances during the investigation period. As per the Code of Conduct of MPL and under Regulation 7(2)(a) of the PIT Regulations, every employee shall disclose to the Company the number of such securities acquired or disposed of within two trading days of such trading if the value of the securities traded, whether in one transaction or in a series of transactions over any calendar quarter, aggregates to a traded value in excess of  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.

Noticee No. 1 has submitted that he has bought/ sold these shares without telling the Company. He has also contended that he has traded in multiple scrips, including scrip of MPL in 2015, and while trading in multiple scrips, he could not pay his dues and shares in his account were squared off. I note that details of these 20 instances were provided in the SCN and Noticee No. 1 has not disputed the same. Apart from a bald statement that these are square off transactions, he has not provided any details of the transactions which were in the nature of square  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 16 of 44  off transactions.  29. In any case, I note that Regulation 7(2)(a) of PIT Regulations requires that whenever the traded value, either through a single transaction or in a series of transactions, exceeds the specified threshold, then the number of securities acquired or disposed of has to be disclosed to the company. As per the language of Regulation 7(2)(a), it is noted that the compliance obligation of an employee to make disclosure to the company triggers when:  29.1. he acquires or disposes of securities; and  29.2. the aggregated value of securities so traded aggregates to a traded value in excess of ten lakh rupees   30. In order to attract the obligation under Regulation 7(2)(a), both the above mentioned conditions should be fulfilled. I note that for the first condition, the mode of acquisition or disposal is not relevant. In other words, instances where the shares are disposed by way of squaring off are specifically exempt from disclosure requirements under this regulation.   31. Further, it is also relevant to note that the words \\\\\\\\u2018trading\\\\\\\\u2019 and \\\\\\\\u2018trade\\\\\\\\u2019 has been defined under Regulation 2(1)(l) of the PIT Regulations as follows: 2.(1)(a)\\\\\\\\u2026..  (l) \"trading\" means and includes subscribing, buying, selling, dealing, or agreeing to subscribe, buy, sell, deal in any securities, and \"trade\" shall be construed accordingly;  32. As seen from the above, the term \\\\\\\\u201ctrading\\\\\\\\u201d is widely defined and is intended to include all dealings in securities without any exclusions. Accordingly, \\\\\\\\u201ctrades\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201ctraded value\\\\\\\\u201d under Regulation 7(2)(a) will have a wider meaning and therefore,  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.   Page 17 of 44  in my view, such square off transactions mentioned by Noticee No. 1 would also be covered within the ambit of this regulation. I also note that by way of his own submissions, Noticee No. 1 is aware of the square off transactions in his account i.e., he would be aware of the quantity of shares squared off and value of the resulting trade. Hence, this contention of Noticee No. 1 cannot be accepted.  33. The Compliance Officer of MPL has also submitted that Noticee No. 1 has not made any disclosures in this regard to MPL. Hence, in view of the above, I hold that Noticee No. 1 has failed to make disclosures to MPL for his trades in the scrip of MPL, which have exceeded the threshold value of Rs. 10 lakhs on 20 occasions.  34. Hence, in view of the above, I find that Noticee No. 1 is in violation of the Code of Conduct of MPL as well as Regulation 7(2)(a) of the PIT Regulations and is liable for penalty under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act.  35. I take note the following provisions of the SEBI Act and the PIT Regulations:  SCHEDULE B [See sub-regulation (1) and sub-regulation (2) of regulation 9] Minimum Standards for Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Insiders 1\\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 10. The code of conduct shall specify the period, which in any event shall not be less than six months, within which a designated person who is permitted to trade shall not execute a contra trade. The compliance officer may be empowered to grant relaxation from strict application of such restriction for reasons to be recorded in writing provided that such relaxation does not violate these regulations. Should a contra trade be executed, inadvertently or otherwise, in violation of such a restriction, the profits from such trade shall be liable to be disgorged for remittance to the Board for credit to the Investor Protection and  Order in the matter of Disclosure Requirements pertaining to trading in the scrip of Marksans Pharma Ltd.

As per the Code of Conduct of MPL, once a pre-cleared trade is executed, the trader shall not execute a contra trade within 6 months from the date of execution of the pre-cleared trade. Investigation has revealed that Noticee No. 1 has entered into 71 contra trades during the investigation period. The details of these instances are as below:    Table 2     (In Rs.)

These firms are verified to be failure to implement the internal control system and in violation of paragraph 2, Article 2 of the Regulations Governing Securities Firms. The FSC therefore imposed administrative sanctions such as warning, correction and fine on the 10 securities firms above according to the seriousness of the deficiencies, requested the sanctioned securities firms to improve their relevant operating procedures in accordance with the opinions of the TWSE and the TPEx, and incorporate the improvement measures into their internal control systems for implementation.

The three securities firms above obviously did not properly implement their internal control system, and are verified to have violated paragraph 2, Article 2 of the Regulations Governing Securities Firms; they are given a warning in accordance with paragraph 1, Article 66 of the of the Securities and Exchange Act, and fined NT$1.44 million in accordance with subparagraph 4, paragraph 1, Article 178-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act.\\\\\\\\n(2)\\\\\\\\xa0 Masterlink Securities has the deficiencies of providing tailor-made system services from its co-location host for specific persons, not establishing a firewall for the connection of the co-location host to the stock exchange, and providing the account with the highest authority level of the host to the outsourcing maintenance vendor; it is obvious that the internal control system is not properly implemented, and the deficiencies are verified to have violated paragraph 2, Article 2 of the Regulations Governing Securities Firms. However, after the spot check, the company has kept the records of investors\\\\\\\\u2019 entrusted transactions processed by the co-location host system in accordance with the regulations, and the violation is less serious than those of three securities firms mentioned above. Therefore, a request for correction is issued in accordance with Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, and a fine of NT$720,000 is imposed in accordance with subparagraph 4, paragraph 1, Article 178-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act.\\\\\\\\n(3)\\\\\\\\xa0 Fubon and JihSun securities firms has the deficiency of not establishing a firewall for the connection of their co-location host to the stock exchange; their internal control system is not properly implemented, and the deficiency is verified to have violated paragraph 2, Article 2 of the Regulations Governing Securities Firms. Therefore, a request for correction is issued in accordance with Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, and a fine of NT$240,000 is imposed in accordance with subparagraph 4, paragraph 1, Article 178-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act.\\\\\\\\n(4)\\\\\\\\xa0 The four securities firms including Hua Nan, Capital, KGI and Yuanta are verified to have the general operation deficiencies of having firewall access records in their co-location host services, and failing to keep transaction backup records for three years according to the regulations. It is obvious that their internal control system is not properly implemented, and the deficiencies are verified to have violated paragraph 2, Article 2 of the Regulations Governing Securities Firms. Therefore, a request for correction is issued in accordance with Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act.\\\\\\\\nThe Securities firms above which receive a warning in accordance with paragraph 1, Article 66 of the Securities and Exchange Act will be restricted in their relevant financial business, including not being able to apply for additional business types or business items, not being able to apply for additional branches, not being able to apply for reinvestment in related businesses, not being able to apply for cash capital increase or raising of corporate bonds, not being able to act as an ETF liquidity provider, and not being able to issue ETNs.\\\\\\\\nAccording to the FSC, the TWSE has been providing co-location host services since December 25, 2017 with the purpose of shortening the speed of receiving market information and transmitting entrusted orders by securities firms, so as to meet the needs of securities firms to improve the efficiency of the trading transmission system to be in line with the international standard. Securities firms are important intermediaries in the securities market and should pay special attention to information security management and compliance with laws and regulations when providing the services above to customers, so as to facilitate the smooth operation of the securities market and safeguard the rights and interests of investors. However, in the recent audit, it is found that some securities firms failed to comply with the regulations regarding the use of co-location host services, and some securities firms even failed to implement the control measures that may affect the security of information communication while serving specific customers. In addition to punishing the securities firms that violate the regulations, so that the securities firms can be vigilant and truly follow the co-location host service management measures and relevant regulations of the TWSE and the TPEx, as well as standardizing the internal control system and implementing the internal audit, the FSC has been supervising the TWSE and the TPEx to continuously strengthen the management measures for securities firms to handle co-location host services.\\\\\\\\nContact unit: Section Chief Hsu, Securities Firms Division, Securities and Futures Bureau\\\\\\\\nTel: 02-2774-7161\\\\\\\\nIf you have any questions, please write to: FSCMAIL", "Date": "2021-03-04", "Regulatory": "FSC TW", "Title": "The FSC Imposed Warnings, Fines and Other Necessary Administrative Sanctions on 10 Securities Firms which Have Deficiencies in the Use of Co-location Host Services", "URL": "https://www.fsc.gov.tw/en/home.jsp?id=95&parentpath=0,2&mcustomize=lawnew_view.jsp&dataserno=202103220001&dtable=NewsLaw", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "Taiwan", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 60437, "unique_record_id": "abf11d1853FSCTW20210304", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6681507178589103064722d0", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 12:32:22", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Non-compliance", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "1,440,000 NT$\n720,000 NT$\n240,000 NT$", "gpt_audience": "1.

The said letter sent to the address as available in the records furnished by the         Page 9 of 62   Show Cause Notice in respect of 28 entities in the matter of preferential allotment of shares by Tirupati Fincorp Ltd.  Company, was returned undelivered with a postal remark: \\\\\\\\u201cAddressee left without instructions\\\\\\\\u201d.  11. Based on the parameters approved by SEBI for surveillance action on companies having made preferential issue in past few years, BSE suspended trading in the securities of Tirupati Fincorp Ltd. (which was one among 102 companies falling in that category and got their trading suspended from time to time).    12. In order to carry out an independent review, the matter was placed by BSE before its Auditors Committee (\\\\\\\\u201cAC\\\\\\\\u201d) for their review and recommendation. The AC at its meeting held on June 22, 2017, after taking into consideration various documents/clarifications filed by the Company from time to time, made inter alia the following observations:  i. The total amount of Rs.4.20 Crore raised out of the preferential issue of 20,00,000 equity shares of Rs.10/- each at a premium of Rs.11 per share to promoter and non-promoter entities, were mainly utilized for: - Rs.1.99 Crore for purchase of goods (fabrics); - Rs.1.48 Crore for granting loans; - Rs.0.40 crores for investments in Tea Exchange Bharat Ltd, and - Rs.0.39 crores as fixed deposit.  ii. Funds collected from few of the preferential allottees have been repaid to them in form of purchase of goods/granting loans as per details below:  Table-4 S/N Name of Allottee Amount paid by Allottee Amount repaid Purpose of payment 1.

Shiv Trading Co. Rs.15.00 Lakh Rs.68.00 Lakh Purchase of goods  iii. The Company has submitted an Auditors\\\\\\\\u2019 Certificate issued by KPND & Co., Chartered Accountants. In view of the aforesaid observations, the certificate confirming that there is no mis-utilization of funds, appears to be equivocal and faulty.  iv.

Hence, the AC of BSE after taking into consideration various submissions made by the Company, concluded that there is mis-utilization of funds raised under preferential issue by the Company.  Subsequently, based on approval from SEBI, the following actions were taken by BSE:- i. Published the list of 19 companies including TFL, on its website where mis-utilization of preferential issue proceeds was observed; ii. Placed the securities of the Company in Stage III of GSM framework with effect from June 18, 2018; iii.

I note that Noticee no. 4 (Neena Sood) has neither availed the opportunity for personal hearing nor has she filed any reply to the SCN.    Submissions of the Noticees:  10. The brief of various submissions made by the Noticees, are as under:  (i) Noticees no. 1, 2 and 3 (Channel Nine Entertainment Ltd, Gaj Raj Singh and Kirti) vide joint letters dated December 11, 2019 and October 24, 2020 have submitted the following: a) Inordinate delay on issuance of SCN and Supplementary SCN: The present SCN is issued after a gap of almost 6 years from the date of preferential allotment by the company. However, no reasons have been mentioned in the SCN for belatedly initiating present proceedings after an unexplained delay of almost 6 years. Importantly, no query was/is raised by SEBI or stock exchange during preferential allotment by the Company. Hence, great prejudice is caused to the company since post issuance of preferential shares, there are large number of material developments which has taken place in the company and on this ground only SCN deserves to be dismissed at the threshold itself.  b) Further, we would like to place reliance on the following judgements passed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019 Supreme Court of India and Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal pertaining to inordinate delay in initiation of proceedings in support of aforesaid contention i. SEBI vs Bhavesh Pabari Order dated 28/02/2019 in Civil Appeal no. 11311 of 2013. Order in the matter of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited   Page 7 of 40  ii. Anilkumar Nandkumar Harchandani & Ors vs. SEBI (Order dated 05.12.2019 in Appeal no. 75 of 2019) iii. Ashok Shivlal Rupani & Anr. Vs. SEBI (Order dated 22.08.2019 in Appeal no. 417 of 20180 iv. Rakesh Kathotia and Ors vs. SEBI (Order dated 27.05.2019 in Appeal no. 07 of 2016) v. H.B. Stock Holding vs. SEBI (Order dated 27.08.2012 in Appeal no. 114 of 2012) vi. SEBI Order dated 13.04.2017 in the matter of Gangotri Textiles Ltd in respect of ISF Securities Ltd.  c) Submission wrt to SEBI Circular dated 31.12.2015: We respectfully state that, while issuing supplementary SCN dated 21.11.2019, Enforcement Department did not consider SEBIs circular dated 31.12.2015 reference bearing no. CIR/CFD/DIL3/18/215 whereby, inter alia procedures are laid down to deal with cases prior to 01.04.2014 involving offer/allotment of securities to more than 49 up to 200 investors in a financial year, considering the higher cap provided in the Companies Act, 2013 so that penal action is avoided. d) It is pertinent to mention that we had not made allotment to more than 49 persons at any point of time. Further, we would also like to submit that we had not made the allotment to more than 200 persons during the financial year 2012-13. Besides, as stated in SEBI Circular dated 31.12.2015 \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI has initiated penal action on receipt of specific complaints against the companies offering such securities without complying with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 and applicable SEBI Guidelines/Regulations governing a public issue\\\\\\\\u201d. In this regard we state that no complaint is filed against the company in respect of the allotment made during the financial year 2012-13. e) The company has passed made following three preferential allotment after complying with provision of Section 81A of the Companies Act, 1956. 9,38,000 shares allotted on 01/11/2012, 4,73,500 shares allotted on 08/11/2012 and 4,98,500 shares allotted on 10/11/2012. Order in the matter of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited   Page 8 of 40  f) BSE also vetted the equity capital issues history of the company and no mention of violation of 67(3) or any other section than those already covered by Exchange when it asked for details pertaining to preferential allotment. A copy of the prospectus was filed with BSE at the time of IPO containing the equity capital history of the company since incorporation and got to approval from the BSE without mention of any violation of Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956 or any other sections of Companies Act, 1956. Copy of approval attached. g) Further a copy of the Prospectus dated February 16, 2013 was filed with Registrar of Companies, NCT of Delhi and Haryana at the time of IPO containing the equity capital history of the company since incorporation and got approval from the Registrar of Companies, NCT of Delhi and Haryana on Feb 18, 2013 without mention of any violation of Section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956 or any other sections of the Companies Act, 1956. h) Further we would also like to submit that a copy of the prospectus was also filed with SEBI at the time of the IPO containing the equity capital history and we had not received any objection from the SEBI at the time of IPO. i) There are many public companies which do not raise capital through public issues because they consider their fund requirement is not huge and secondly the cost of raising funds through public issue is prohibitive. Such companies raise funds through private placements i.e. friends and relatives of the promoters contribute to the capital/securities of the company. The modus operandi adopted by such companies is that these companies pass a special resolution under section 81(IA) of the state that the company is permitted to offer shares to persons other than but including the existing shareholders and the resolution specifies the number of shares, the premium, if any, and also other relevant details. j) Small unlisted public companies never issued any offer or invitation to attract section 67. Since these companies have not made any offer or invitation, there cannot be any deeming fiction as mentioned in section 67(3). Allotment of shares to 50 persons or more is a different issue. The term \\\\\\\\u201coffer\\\\\\\\u201d has not been defined under the Companies act, 1956. The Order in the matter of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited   Page 9 of 40  prospectus is an invitation for an offer to the public for the subscription or purchase of any securities. When the invitation is accepted, the offer is made to the company. When an offer is made through an application, the company allots the shares, which is acceptance of the offer. Once the shares are allotted, contracts are concluded. Since these unlisted companies have not issued any prospectus, there was no invitation to the public to subscribe for the shares of the company. k) Further, we would like to submit that CNEL had allotted equity shares to 100 persons on a continuous basis from November 01, 2012 to November 10, 2012 on 3 instances through preferential allotment during financial year 2012-13. As on date 41 allottees out of 100 are no longer shareholders of the company because they have already got exit from the company by selling their shares on a very good return. l) Further we would like to submit that the allotment of equity shares to a total of 100 persons on 3 instances from November 01, 2012 to November 10. 2012 was made under Companies Act, 1956.  m) Further we state that we have not made the allotment to more than 49 persons at a time and in total we have not made the allotment to more than 200 persons in a financial year, we had made the allotment to less than 49 person at a time and in total to 100 person during the financial year 2012-2013 as mentioned in your notice.  n) Section 67(1) provides that any offer of shares or debentures to any section of the public or clients of the issuer shall be deemed to be an offer to the public. In the same way, section 67(2) provides that any invitation to subscribe for the shares or debentures to any section of the public or clients of the issuer shall be deemed to be an offer to the public. It is immaterial whether the issuer selects such offeree [Section 67(1)] or the invitee [Section 67(2)] as a member or debenture holder of the issuer or not. The provisions of Section 67(1) and 67(2) are subject to the provisions contained in section 67(3). To put it differently, section 67(3) carves out an exception to the principle mentioned in section 67(1) and (2) that an offer or invitation to a section of the public or clients is a public issue. Section 67(3) provides that an offer or invitation to a section of the public Order in the matter of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited   Page 10 of 40  or clients is a public issue. Section 67(3) provides that an offer or invitation is not treated as public offer is any one of the following is satisfied: i. If the offer or invitation can be regarded as not being calculated to result directly or indirectly in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving such offer or invitation; or ii. If the offer or invitation can be regarded otherwise as being domestic concern of the persons making or receiving the offer or invitation. The Companies (Amendment) Act, 2000 with effect from 13.12.2000 inserted first proviso to section 67(3) which reads as under: \\\\\\\\u201cProvided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall apply in a case where the offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or debentures is made to 50 persons or more.\\\\\\\\u201d  o) The Ministry of Corporate Affairs on 4.12.2003 promulgated Unlisted Public Companies (Preferential Allotment) Rules, 2003 attached as Annexure-12 providing for certain disclosures to be made in the explanatory statement issued pursuant to section 173(2) of the Act. These rules were amended on 14.12.2011 providing that in \\\\\\\\u2018preferential allotment\\\\\\\\u2019, offer shall not be made to 50 persons or more is attached as Annexure-13. p) On account of the amendment by the insertion of the first proviso to section 67(3), there is a wrong notion that any allotment of shares by any unlisted public company to 50 or more persons in a financial year between 2000 to 2013 is in violation of section 67(3) and section 73. The main thrust in section 67 for the determination of the question as to whether there a public offer or not, if offer or invitation. When there is an offer or invitation to subscribe for the shares, section 67 is triggered. There are three important ingredients in section 67 to treat a private placement as a public offer. i. There has to be an offer or invitation ii. Such offer/invitation has to be made by the company iii. It has to be made to 50 or more persons. Order in the matter of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited   Page 11 of 40  If any one of these three condition is not satisfied, such \\\\\\\\u2018private placement\\\\\\\\u2019 cannot be regarded as \\\\\\\\u2018public offer\\\\\\\\u2019 by way of deeming fiction under the first proviso to section 67(3). When there is no offer or invitation, section 67 is not at all attracted and much less section 67(3) and 73. q) As per section 2(36) of the Companies Act, 1956, \\\\\\\\u2018Prospectus\\\\\\\\u2019 is defined to mean any document described or issued as a prospectus and includes any notice, circular, advertisement or other document inviting deposits from the public or inviting offers from the public for the subscription or purchase of any shares in, or debentures of, a body corporate. Section 2(a) of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009 \\\\\\\\u201cAdvertisement\\\\\\\\u201d is said to include notices, brochures, pamphlets, show cards, catalogues, hoardings, placards, posters, insertions in newspaper, cover pages of offer documents, pictures and films in any print media or electronic media, radio, television programme. Section 2(p) of ICDR Regulations, 2009 \\\\\\\\u201cInitial Public Offer\\\\\\\\u201d is defined to mean an offer of specified securities by an unlisted issuer to the public for subscription and includes an offer for sale of specified securities to the public by any existing holders of such securities in an unlisted issuer. Section 2(x) of ICDR Regulations, 2009 \\\\\\\\u201cOffer document\\\\\\\\u201d means a red herring prospectus, prospectus or shelf prospectus and information memorandum in terms of section 60A of the Companies Act, 1956 in case of a public issue and letter of offer in case of a rights issue. Section 2(z) of ICDR Regulations \\\\\\\\u201cpreferential issue\\\\\\\\u201d means an issue of specified securities by a listed issuer to any select person or group of persons on a private placement basis and does not include an offer of specified securities made through a public issue, rights issue, bonus issue, employee stock option scheme, employee stock purchase scheme or qualified institutions placement or an issue of sweat equity shares or depository receipts issued in a country outside India or foreign securities. Section 2(zc) of ICDR Regulations \\\\\\\\u201cPublic issue\\\\\\\\u201d means an initial public offer or further public offer. Section 2(n) of ICDR Regulations \\\\\\\\u201cFurther Public Offer\\\\\\\\u201d means an offer of specified securities by a listed issuer to the public for subscription and includes an offer for Order in the matter of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited   Page 12 of 40  sale of specified securities to the public by any existing holders of such securities in a listed issuer. r) All the definitions such as prospectus, advertisement, etc. indicated above refer to a written communication from the company in order to treat the same as an \\\\\\\\u2018offer\\\\\\\\u2019. In other words, if there is no written or visual communication by or on behalf of the company, there cannot be any offer or invitation and the provisions of section 67 have no application under such circumstances. It is true that the offer or invitation by a company has to be in writing because a company being a juristic person cannot communicate verbally and the same has to be only through written communication. In the cases of such unlisted companies where there were no written communications, there was no document or written communication to offer the shares or to invite the public to subscribe the shares of the company. In the absence of any such written document, section 67 has no applicability. s) Further the company has made the preferential allotment from November 01, 2012 to November 10, 2012 after complying with the provisions of Section 81(1A) of the Companies Act, 1956.  t) Reference order passed by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in case of Sahara and its inapplicability in our case: i. Sahara issued securities through friends, associates, group companies, workers/employees and other individuals associated/affiliated or connected in any manner with Sahara group of companies. ii. There was a network of around 2900 branch officer, 10 lac agents and other people involved in fund raising. Sahara circulated information memorandum along with application forms to various persons. Sahara had approximately 3 crores of investors and a collection of Rs. 24,000/- crores. SEBI received private complaint alleging violation of various statutory requirements by Sahara group companies. In light of the above facts, the apex court delivered its judgement, the substance of which is as under: Order in the matter of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited   Page 13 of 40  iii. Section 67(3) is an exception to section 67(1) and 67(2). As a result of proviso to section 67(3), if an offer of shares or debentures is made to 50 or more persons, it would deemed to be a public issue even if the requirements of section 67(3)(a) or section 67(3)(b) are met. iv. Optionally/fully convertible debentures are also securities and covered by section 67. SEBI has the jurisdiction in respect of such issues because these securities fell within the purview of section 55A of the Act.  v. The argument that the Rules were amended only 2011 restricting the number of investors to 49 in the definition of \\\\\\\\u2018preferential allotment\\\\\\\\u2019 and hence, offers made prior to that date were in order, was turned down by the Apex Court stating that the Rules are subordinate legislation and they cannot supersede the express provision i.e. section 67(3). vi. Non-provision of information demanded by SEBI amounted to avoidance and hence, the issue was a public issue. vii. Though Sahara\\\\\\\\u2019s case was considered to be within the jurisdiction of SEBI and offer by Sahara to 50 or more persons was considered to be a public offer, the same ration was arrived at on the basis of facts enumerated in para viiia. It cannot apply invariably to each and every allotment of shares to 50 persons or more in a year by any unlisted public company. viii. The Supreme Court in the said judgment relied on intention of Sahara to determine whether the issue of securities was public issue or not. The Supreme Court observed that the \\\\\\\\u201cacta exterior indicant interior secrata\\\\\\\\u201d (external action reveals inner secret) applies with all force in Sahara\\\\\\\\u2019s case. The court observed that the intention of Sahara was known its action of offering shares to more than 50 persons and hence was liable to get its shares listed. In the case of such unlisted companies where there were no offers, there was no action of offering shares at all to the public and hence, the action of Order in the matter of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited   Page 14 of 40  such companies does not justify an inference of intention being drawn as was done in Sahara case by the apex court. u) It is pertinent to mention that Noticee no. 3 viz. Ms. Kirti had resigned from the directorship of the company w.e.f. 31.05.2014, notice no. 4 viz. Ms. Neena Sood, had resigned from the directorship of the company w.e.f. 25.05.2018 and Noticee no. 5 viz. Mr. Dinesh Kumar Jindal had resigned from the directorship of the company w.e.f. 27.06.2013. In our humble and respectful submissions, any directions issued to the past directors of the company would be travesty of justice since presently they are not associated with the Company hence are not in a position to carry out or enforce any directions, if any, issued against the company. v) It is pertinent to mention that post issuance of shares through preferential issue, we had come out with the initial public offer of shares. On successful completion of our IPO, shares of our company got listed on 12.03.2013 at BSE under SME segment. Pertinently, as on quarter ending 31.03.2020, public holding is around 18.50 crore shares (around 80% of total paid up capital) which is held by 910 public shareholders. Hence any adverse directions issued against us could cause and result into great harm, loss and damage to the present public shareholders of our company. Consequently great prejudice would be caused to the innocent investors of our company. For ready references, shareholding pattern for the quarter ending March 2020 as downloaded from BSE website is enclosed hereto as Annexure-A. w) As stated hereinabove, in due compliance of statutory provisions of law, we had come out with an IPO which got listed at BSE-SME segment on 12.03.2013. At the relevant time, we had appointed Guiness Corporate Advisors Pvt. Ltd. (Formerly known as Guiness Merchant Bankers Pvt. Ltd.) as a \\\\\\\\u201cLead Managers\\\\\\\\u201d to carry out all Manager legal procedure and compliances for purpose of IPO. The Lead Manager of the Company has carried out proper due diligence in respect of the IPO of the company and lead manager also did not mention about any alleged violation of Section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956 or any other sections of the Companies Act, 1956 or any other sections of the Companies Act, 1956. Order in the matter of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited   Page 15 of 40  x) It is pertinent to mention that investigation was conducted by SEBI to ascertain the role of Merchant Banker w.r.t the disclosures made in the prospectus of the IPOs of the four scrips including our scrip and pursuant thereto adjudication proceeding were initiated against the lead merchant banker viz. Guiness (Ref. Para 1 on internal page no. 1, last three line of the adjudication order dated 04.12.2019). The findings with regard to us is summarised under para 11 on internal page no. 18 to 20 of the adjudication order. On perusal of the same, it is submitted that no findings about any non-compliance on issuance of preferential shares in mentioned therein. In out humble submission, if the issuance of preferential shares was in non-compliance of any statutory provision of law, the same ought to have been disclosed in the prospectus by the lead merchant banker viz. Guiness and non-disclosure, if any, would have triggered non-compliances on the part of Lead Manager viz. Guiness. Since there are no adverse findings made against the Lead Manager, necessarily Ld. Investigation Officers and Ld. Adjudicating Officer of SEBI had not found any adversity on issuance of preferential shares by us. In view thereof, the present proceedings as initiated against us be dropped and we may be discharged at the earliest.  y) Besides it is pertinent to mention that SEBI had conducted investigation interalia into the alleged price manipulation in our scrip wherein role of shareholders who were allotted shares on preferential basis were also looked and examined systematically into. Importantly, on completion of the said investigation, no adverse findings were observed against those preferential allottees of our company. The relevant portion from the order dated 06.09.2017 passed by Ld. Whole Time Member, SEBI is reproduced. Pertinently, no adverse findings wrt issuance of preferential shares by us are observed in the said investigation conducted by SEBI and accordingly issuance of preferential shares allotted to the persons are considered as in compliance of statutory provision of law. Therefore in our humble submissions, adverse findings and the directions as proposed to be issued against us are unwarranted and unjustifiable. Order in the matter of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited   Page 16 of 40  z) On perusal of yearly price volume chart as downloaded from BSE website, we state that trading in our shares have been quite liquid and therefore every preferential allottees had adequate and sufficient opportunity to exit, if required, by them.

Vide an e\\\\\\\\u2013mail dated November 28, 2020, the Noticee had once again requested for adjournment of the personal hearing.  In view of the fact that four opportunities for personal hearing had earlier been granted to the Noticee, SEBI vide an e\\\\\\\\u2013mail dated December 2, 2020, informed the Noticee that no further adjournment will be granted in the matter.  The Noticee was also informed that it may submit written submissions, if any, on the matter on or before December__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Sahara India Financial Corporation Limited                          Page 4 of 12  11, 2020.  The Noticee however, failed to appear for the hearing on December 2, 2020.  Further, as on date, no reply on merits to the SCN/ written submissions, have been received from the Noticee.    CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS:  3.1 I have considered the material available on record i.e. Enquiry Report along with the SCN.  I note that the Noticee has not filed any reply/written submissions on merits for consideration during the course of these proceedings.  The Noticee had also failed to appear for the personal hearing before me.  I am therefore of the considered view that the Noticee has been provided with sufficient time to submit a reply to the SCN and also adequate opportunities to present its submissions before SEBI and defend itself against the allegations contained in the SCN, which is sought to be adjudicated in the instant proceedings.  Keeping in mind the aforesaid, I am of the considered view that the instant proceedings against the Noticee be undertaken ex parte on the basis of the material available on record.  3.2 From the material available on record, the following is noted:   A.

SEBI vide an Order dated June 23, 2011, directed Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cSIRECL\\\\\\\\u201d) and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cSHICL\\\\\\\\u201d) to refund the money collected through Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (\\\\\\\\u201cOFCDs\\\\\\\\u201d) from the investors and restrained from associating themselves with any listed public company and any public company which intends to raise money from the public, till such time the aforesaid payments were made to the satisfaction of SEBI, Subrata Roy Sahara, Vandana Bhargava, Ravi Shankar Dubey and Ashok Roy Choudhary, being the promoters/ directors of SIRECL and SHICL.  This Order of SEBI was confirmed by the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (\\\\\\\\u201cSAT\\\\\\\\u201d) vide its order dated October 18, 2011.  Thereafter, the__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Sahara India Financial Corporation Limited                          Page 6 of 12  appeals filed by SIRECL and SHICL before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India also got dismissed vide Order dated August 31, 2012.  Vide the aforementioned Order and an Order dated December 5, 2013, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had inter alia directed SIRECL and SHICL to refund to SEBI the amount collected through Red Herring Prospectus dated March 13, 2008 and October 16, 2009, along with an interest @ 15% per annum from the date of receipt of the subscription amount till the date of repayment within three months from the date of that Order.  Subsequently the Apex Court passed several orders / directions in the matter against Subrata Roy Sahara on account of delay in refunding the aforementioned amount.  ii. SEBI vide an Order dated July 28, 2015 had cancelled the Certificate of registration of Sahara Mutual Fund (\\\\\\\\u201cSahara MF\\\\\\\\u201d) as it did not satisfy the \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 criteria.  The impugned order was issued consequent to the findings by SEBI that Sahara India Financial Corporation Ltd. was not a \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 because its Promoter-Director was not a fit and proper person and hence, Sahara MF and Sahara Asset Management Company Private Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cSahara AMC\\\\\\\\u201d) were no longer fit and proper to carry on the business of mutual fund.  This SEBI Order was upheld by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT vide its Order dated July 28, 2017 (Misc. Application no. 188 of 2017 and Appeal no. 428 of 2015) and thereafter, also by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court vide its Order dated October 23, 2017 in Civil Appeal no. 12854 of 2017.  iii. SEBI vide an Order dated February 27, 2015, held that Sahara AMC does not qualify to be \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 to act as a Portfolio Manager in the Indian securities market and therefore, its request for renewal of Certificate of registration was rejected and the Certificate stood cancelled.  Thereafter, vide an Order dated December 30, 2015, SEBI had rejected the application filed by Sahara AMC for reconsideration of the Order dated February 27, 2015.  Subsequently, Sahara AMC had filed an appeal against the Order dated December 30, 2015, which was dismissed vide the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT\\\\\\\\u2019s Order dated October 31, 2017 (Appeal no. 72 of 2016).__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Sahara India Financial Corporation Limited                          Page 7 of 12  3.4 In this context, I note that vide its letter dated July 1, 2019, the Noticee while seeking adjournment of the personal hearing scheduled on July 11, 2019, had stated:   We would like to mention that on the winding\\\\\\\\u2013up petition of the Reserve Bank of India (\\\\\\\\u201cRBI\\\\\\\\u201d) against the Noticee, a single bench of the Allahabad High Court passed the winding up Order on 15.02.2019 and appointed the Official Liquidator.  On appeal before the (Division) Bench, the aforesaid winding up Order has been upheld by the Allahabad High Court on 13.05.2019.  In an appeal against the Order of the Allahabad High Court, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court vide an Order dated 8.05.2019 directed: \\\\\\\\u201cStatus quo, as on today, be maintained until further orders.\\\\\\\\u201d Accordingly, the winding up proceedings in the Allahabad High Court also got adjourned till the final disposal of the Special Appeals in the Supreme Court.     3.5 As per information obtained from the Supreme Court website i.e. https://main.sci.gov.in/case-status, the status of the aforementioned Special Leave Petition is indicated as pending for admission.  In light of the aforementioned, I am of the view that the penalty, if any, proposed to be imposed under the Intermediaries Regulations may not have a bearing on the proceedings pending before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court.   3.6 From the information obtained from the MCA21 Portal as on February 25, 2021, the following is observed:   A.

Subrata Roy Sahara had resigned from the Board of Directors of the Noticee on March 22, 2017 (see also the observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in its Order dated July 28, 2017, as reproduced at paragraph 3.8 of this Order).__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Sahara India Financial Corporation Limited                          Page 8 of 12  C. The shareholding pattern in the Noticee as on December 30, 2020, is as under:        D. Accordingly, Subrata Roy Sahara continues to be a substantial shareholder in the Noticee.   3.7 I note that the Certificate of registration granted by SEBI to the Noticee is subject to compliance with the conditions specified under Regulation 7(2)(e) read with Schedule II of Intermediaries Regulations, which deal with \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 criteria.  The aforesaid criteria is a continuous requirement to be satisfied throughout the period of validity of the Certificate of registration.  It is the duty of SEBI to constantly monitor the \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 criteria of intermediaries to maintain the integrity of the securities market.  It has to take into account the financial integrity, honesty, good reputation and character of the registered intermediary.  As a watchdog of the securities market and protector of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s interest, SEBI cannot take it lightly in view of the__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Sahara India Financial Corporation Limited                          Page 9 of 12  actions/proceedings carried out against a substantial shareholder/Promoter of the Noticee i.e. Subrata Roy Sahara and the Companies with whom he is associated.  The \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 criteria in the present matter is required to be seen from a wider perspective as interpreted by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Jermyn Capital LLC vs. SEBI (Order dated September 6, 2006), which is reproduced below:    9. \\\\\\\\u201cA reading of the aforesaid provisions of the Regulations makes it abundantly clear that the concept of a fit and proper person has a very wide amplitude as the name \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 itself suggests.  The Board can take into account \\\\\\\\u201cany consideration as it deems fit\\\\\\\\u201d for the purpose of determining whether an applicant or an intermediary seeking registration is a fit and proper person or not.  The framers of the Regulations have consciously given such wide powers because of their concern to keep the market clean and free from undesirable elements.  It can take into account the financial integrity of the applicant and its competence.  Absence of convictions or civil liabilities would be another relevant consideration which could weigh with the Board.  Good reputation and character of the applicant is a very material consideration which must necessarily weigh in the mind of the Board in this regard.  Reputation is what others perceive of you.  In other words, it is the subjective opinion or impression of others about a person and that, according to the Regulations, has to be good.  \\\\\\\\u2026 In the case of a body corporate or a firm, the reputation of its whole time director(s) or managing partner(s) would come into focus.  The Board as a regulator has been assigned a statutory duty to protect the integrity of the securities market and also interest of investors in securities apart from promoting the development of and regulating the market by such measures as it may think fit.  It is in the discharge of this statutory obligation that the Board has framed the Regulations with a view to keep the market place safe for the investors to invest by keeping the undesirable elements out.  The Regulations apply across to all sets of regulations and all intermediaries of the securities market including those who associate themselves with the market and they all have to satisfy the criteria of \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 before they could be registered under any of the relevant regulations and this criteria they must continue to satisfy throughout the period of validity of their registration and throughout the period they associate with the market.  The purpose of the Regulations is to achieve the aforesaid objects and make the securities market a safe place to invest.  One bad element can, not only pollute the market but can play havoc with it which could be detrimental to the interests of the innocent investors.  In this background, the Board may, in a given case, be justified in keeping a doubtful__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Sahara India Financial Corporation Limited                          Page 10 of 12  character or an undesirable element out from the market rather than running the risk of allowing the market to be polluted. \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u201d  3.8 As observed from paragraph 3.6, Subrata Roy Sahara is a Promoter and continues to hold substantial shareholding in the Noticee and therefore, is also capable of exercising control and influence over the management of the Noticee, thereby making it not a \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 in terms of Regulation 7(2)(e) read with Schedule II of the Intermediaries Regulations, to continue to act as a sub\\\\\\\\u2013broker.  In this context, reliance is placed on the Order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT dated July 28, 2017, in the matter of Sahara Asset Management Company P. Limited & Others vs. SEBI, Misc. Application no. 188 of 2017 and Appeal no. 428 of 2015 (which was upheld by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court on October 23, 2017 in Civil Appeal no. 12854 of 2017):  10. \\\\\\\\u201cIt is an admitted fact that Mr. Subrata Roy Sahara holds 79.80% of the equity capital of Sahara India Financial Corporation Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cSahara Sponsor\\\\\\\\u201d) and 53.34% of its preference capital.  Even after the resignation of Mr. Subrata Roy Sahara there is no change in this equity / preference holding.  It is also a fact that the full equity / preference holding in the Sahara AMC is also held by the Sahara Sponsor and other Sahara Group Companies together though two of its group companies SIRECL and SHICL are not holding any equity in the Sahara AMC.  It is also on record that Mr. Sahara was a Director in all the Group Companies which hold the shares of Sahara AMC.  Such high shareholding in the sponsor by one promoter and in the AMC by the same promoter group companies clearly establish the capability of that one Promoter / Director to control the affairs of the Sahara Sponsor and thereby that in the Sahara AMC and Sahara Mutual Fund.  Therefore, even if Mr. Sahara ceases to be a Director in the Sahara Sponsor, given the facts of the present matter, his ability to control the activities of the Sahara Mutual Fund cannot be doubted.  This is made abundantly clear by the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court dated May 6, 2014 \\\\\\\\u2026 Therefore, the findings in the impugned order that Mr. Subrata Roy Sahara exercises full and complete control of the Sahara Sponsor and Sahara AMC cannot be disputed.  In view of this, Mr. Sahara\\\\\\\\u2019s resignation from the Board of Directors of the Sahara Sponsor on March 22, 2017 does not alter the ground reality regarding his control over the Sahara Sponsor in which he continue to hold about 80% of the equity capital. \\\\\\\\u2026 15. The present appeal before us is regarding the fit and proper status of a Promoter / Director of Sahara Sponsor who holds about 80% of its capital and who controls all Sahara Group__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Sahara India Financial Corporation Limited                          Page 11 of 12  Companies and hence, on the fit and proper status of Sahara Sponsor to continue as Sponsor of a mutual fund in the context of SEBI / Supreme Court Orders against Mr. Sahara and two Sahara Group Companies.  The Mutual Fund Regulations state that the Sponsor Company as well as its Key Managerial Persons or Key Person who controls the Company is to be fit and proper.  No cited judgments are issued in the context of the securities market wherein the SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations under this Act were examined.  In the securities market, SEBI Act empowers SEBI to take actions in the interest of protecting the interests of the investors and hence lifting the corporate veil to the extent to identify who controls a regulated entity cannot be faulted.  Without such a power SEBI will be a mute spectator to many of the corporate misdeeds which may jeopardize the interests of investors.  Given the mandate of SEBI to protect the interests of the investors in the securities market SEBI is statutorily empowered to lift the corporate veil and find out the truth whenever interests of the investors are affected or likely to be affected.  In the instant case SEBI itself found that two group companies of Sahara and its Directors were not conducting their business following the rules relating to public issue and were restrained from associating themselves with any listed Company or Company which intends to raise money from the public.  It was also found that one of the Promoters / Directors is prima facie holding absolute control over the group companies.  Given these facts and circumstances, lifting the corporate veil to the extent of identifying the role of the Promoter / Director in the impugned order cannot be faulted.  ... 16. In the result, we find no merit in the appeal. Accordingly, appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs\\\\\\\\u201d    3.9 Incidentally, from the information obtained from the MCA21 portal, it is also noted that Om Prakash Srivastava, present Director in the Noticee, was earlier also a Director in Sahara AMC, whose Certificate of registration to act as a Portfolio Manager was cancelled vide SEBI Order dated February 27, 2015, which was subsequently upheld by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT vide its Order dated October 31, 2017 (see also paragraph 3.3. iii).   3.10 For the reasons mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, I am in agreement with the findings of the DA that the Noticee is not a \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 in terms of Regulation 7(2)(e) read with Schedule II of the Intermediaries Regulations.  Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the instant proceedings, I accept the recommendation of the DA that the Certificate of registration granted to the Noticee as a sub\\\\\\\\u2013broker, be cancelled.  This Order is being passed under Regulation 27(5) of__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Sahara India Financial Corporation Limited                          Page 12 of 12  the Intermediaries Regulations, which substituted Regulation 28 of the aforesaid Regulations, with effect from January 21, 2021.    ORDER \\\\\\\\u2013  4.1 I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 19 read with Section 12(3) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 27(5) of the Intermediaries Regulations, hereby cancel the Certificate of registration of the Noticee, i.e. Sahara India Financial Corporation Limited, (sub\\\\\\\\u2013broker having SEBI Registration Nos.: BSE \\\\\\\\u2013 INS018655139 and NSE \\\\\\\\u2013 INS238266238).    4.2 This Order shall come into force immediately on the expiry of twenty one (21) days from the date of this Order.    4.3 A copy of this Order shall be served on the Noticee immediately.

In view of the same, I note that there is no reply of the Noticees on record. On perusal of the material on record, the following issues arise for determination:  15.1.

Issue No. 1: Whether ITC was holding itself out and/ or acting as an investment adviser and/ or research analyst?  16. I have perused the interim order dated March 17, 2016, for the, prima facie, finding of unregistered IA and RA services provided by ITC. I note the following material has been placed by ITC on its website, www.bookprofit.co.in:    \\\\\\\\u201cHighlights of Services  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Share market tips from our Research team and Experts  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Daily Stock ideas in Equity and Future markets,  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Intraday, short term, long term ideas, pre-market SMS on market for day,  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Ideas delivered during market hours   About Us  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 \\\\\\\\u201cIndira Trading Company offers integrated stock market recommendation and financial guidance pertaining to stock market to its clientele spread across nation.

The packages offered by Indira Trading to its clients, as observed from its website, are \\\\\\\\u201cEquity Intraday\\\\\\\\u201d, \\\\\\\\u201cDelivery Short Term/ BTST\\\\\\\\u201d, \\\\\\\\u201cDerivatives Future\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cOptions Package\\\\\\\\u201d. It was observed that the cost of services varies according to the selected package and the time period of the service.

Cost of the package =Rs. 10,000 for 1 month  18. The fees for the aforesaid services ranged from Rs. 10,000/- to Rs. 15,000/- and are levied by ITC on monthly and quarterly basis.   19. The bank statement for account number 188705000147 belonging to ITC was examined and the following is observed:  19.1. The details of the credits received in this account are as below:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Final Order in the matter of Indira Trading Company Page 9 of 20 A/c no. (Bank) Date of Account Opening Bank Statement Period No. of Credit Transaction (approx.) Date of last Credit Total Credit in Rs (approx.)* Closing Balance in Rs.

It is observed from analysis of the credits in the said bank statement that credits have been received by way of NEFT transfers, cash deposits, etc., from various individuals.  20. An examination of the documents of ITC shows the following:  20.1. The nature of business mentioned in the Partnership Deed is \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advisory\\\\\\\\u201d, etc. 20.2. The nature of business in the AOF/KYC is \\\\\\\\u201cServices\\\\\\\\u201d, while the type of industry is mentioned as \\\\\\\\u201cFinancial Services\\\\\\\\u201d. 20.3. In the letter addressed to ICICI Bank at time of account opening, it is mentioned that ITC shall carry out the business of \\\\\\\\u201cFinancial Advisory\\\\\\\\u201d.  21. In light of the aforesaid discussions, on the basis of the material available on record, I observe that ITC has been putting information in public domain/ advertising by using website, namely www.bookprofit.co.in, about the various services offered by it in the securities market. The partnership deed of ITC mentions that the business intended to be carried out by the firm is \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advisory\\\\\\\\u201d, while the AOF/KYC of the bank states that the business of the firm will be Financial Services/ Advisory. It is also observed that various plans/ packages are being offered by ITC to avail its services. In view of the above facts and circumstances, especially the contents of the website, coupled with the credit transactions in the bank account, details of which were given on the said website, it is inferred that the fees/ funds credited in the said bank account, were for the purpose of availing the services indicated on the website of ITC. Hence,__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Final Order in the matter of Indira Trading Company Page 10 of 20 ITC was carrying out services related to investments in the securities market as mentioned on the website.  22. In this regard, I have perused the following provisions of the IA Regulations:  Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations:  \\\\\\\\u201cinvestment advice\\\\\\\\u201d means advice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning:  Provided that investment advice given through newspaper, magazines, any electronic or broadcasting or telecommunications medium, which is widely available to the public shall not be considered as investment advice for the purpose of these regulations;  Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations:  \\\\\\\\u201cinvestment adviser\\\\\\\\u201d means any person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d.   23. In the light of the aforesaid observations, it is evident that the activities of ITC of giving trading tips, stock specific recommendations, etc. to investors, on payment of fees as per its packages, fall within the definition of Investment Advice, as per the IA Regulations. The act of ITC of providing such services for consideration falls under the definition of Investment Adviser, as defined by Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations. Therefore, I find that ITC was holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser within the meaning of the terms, as given in the IA Regulations.   24. I have also perused the following definitions in the RA Regulations:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Final Order in the matter of Indira Trading Company Page 11 of 20 Regulation 2(u) of the RA Regulations:  \\\\\\\\u201cresearch analyst\\\\\\\\u201d means a person who is primarily responsible for,- i. preparation or publication of the content of the research report; or  ii. providing research report; or  iii. making 'buy/sell/hold' recommendation; or  iv. giving price target; or  v. offering an opinion concerning public offer,  with respect to securities that are listed or to be listed in a stock exchange, whether or not any such person has the job title of 'research analyst' and includes any other entities engaged in issuance of research report or research analysis. Explanation.-The term also includes any associated person who reports directly or indirectly to such a research analyst in connection with activities provided above;  Regulation 2(w) of the RA Regulations:  \\\\\\\\u201cresearch report\\\\\\\\u201d means any written or electronic communication that includes research analysis or research recommendation or an opinion concerning securities or public offer, providing a basis for investment decision\\\\\\\\u2026  25. In view of the definitions given above, I find that ITC was offering research analyst services as defined under the RA Regulations. I am of the view that the said \\\\\\\\u2018buy/sell/hold recommendations\\\\\\\\u2019 and \\\\\\\\u2018price targets\\\\\\\\u2019 can be regarded as research analysis. Similarly, the service offered by ITC called \\\\\\\\u2018Ideas on Demand\\\\\\\\u2019 appears to be a service where any investor, for a payment of Rs. 500/- per stock, will receive detailed information on that stock, \\\\\\\\u2018buy/ sell/ hold\\\\\\\\u2019 recommendation on that stock, etc. I note that by the definition given in Regulation 2(w) of the RA Regulations these services offered by ITC would be included within the meaning of \\\\\\\\u201cresearch report\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that ITC was holding itself out and acting as a research analyst within the meaning of the terms, as given in the RA Regulations.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Final Order in the matter of Indira Trading Company Page 12 of 20 26. In view of the above, on the basis of the material available on record, I note that the first credit in the bank account of ITC maintained with ICICI Bank was on March 24, 2015, while the last credit, on record, has been received on March 22, 2016. In view of the same, on the basis of the material available on record, I find that ITC was holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser and research analyst from March 24, 2015, till March 22, 2016.  Issue No. 2: If answer to Issue No. 1 is in affirmative, whether ITC has violated any provisions of the SEBI Act read with the provisions of the IA Regulations and/ or the RA Regulations?  27. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the provisions of Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, the text of which are reproduced below:   SEBI Act  Registration of stock brokers, sub-brokers, share transfer agents, etc. 12. (1) No stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:   28. In order to ensure that investors who receive investment advice or services of a research analyst are protected, it is imperative that any entity carrying out the activities of an investment adviser or research analyst has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of the relevant SEBI Regulations, which is mandated by Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act and is reproduced above.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Final Order in the matter of Indira Trading Company Page 13 of 20 29. Regulation 3(1) of the IA regulations, states that:   \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.   As per Regulation 3(1) of the RA Regulations:  \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as a research analyst or research entity or hold itself out as a research analyst unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations.\\\\\\\\u201d  30. Thus, as per Section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations and Regulation 3(1) of the RA Regulations, any entity carrying out activities of an investment adviser or research analyst has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI regulations i.e., the registration of the investment advisers and research analysts is mandatory.  31. The activities of ITC, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that ITC was carrying out activities of an investment adviser and research analyst. Neither ITC nor any of its partners, in their individual capacity, hold a certificate of registration as an Investment Adviser or a Research Analyst nor are they registered with SEBI as an intermediary in any capacity.   32. I note here that ITC has been incorporated as a partnership on December 22, 2014. The date of the first credit in the ICICI Bank account bearing number 188705000147 is March 24, 2015. Hence, on the basis of the material available on record, I find that ITC was holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser and research analyst from March 24, 2015.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Final Order in the matter of Indira Trading Company Page 14 of 20 33. The proviso to Regulation 3 of the IA Regulations states that \\\\\\\\u201ca person acting as an investment adviser immediately before the commencement of these regulations may continue to do so for a period of six months from such commencement or, if it has made an application for a certificate \\\\\\\\u2026 within the said period of six months, till the disposal of such application.\\\\\\\\u201d Similarly, the proviso to Regulation 3 of the RA Regulations states that \\\\\\\\u201cany person acting as research analyst or research entity before the commencement of these regulations may continue to do so for a period of six months from such commencement or, if it has made an application for a certificate of registration under sub-regulation (2) within the said period of six months, till the disposal of such application.\\\\\\\\u201d   34. The IA Regulations were notified on January 21, 2013, and came into effect on April 21, 2013. Therefore, any person who had been providing investment advisory services before the IA Regulations came into effect can, by virtue of the proviso under Regulation 3, continue to do so without a certificate of registration till October 20, 2013, beyond which the said person would have to obtain a certificate of registration or may continue to do so till the time his application for registration is disposed of. Similarly, the RA Regulations were notified on September 1, 2014, and came into effect on December 1, 2014. As per the provisions of law, any person who had been providing research analyst services before the RA Regulations came into effect, could do so without a certificate of registration till June 1, 2015, beyond which the said person would have to obtain a certificate of registration or may continue to do so till the time his application for registration is disposed of.  35. I note that ITC has been holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser and research analyst after the IA and RA Regulations came into effect and was required to apply for registration as an investment adviser and research analyst under the respective regulations. However, the material on record shows that ITC has not made any application for registering itself as an investment adviser or research analyst with SEBI. Further, I find that the last credit in the ICICI Bank account is on March 22,__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Final Order in the matter of Indira Trading Company Page 15 of 20 2016, and hence, ITC was providing investment advisory and research analyst services even as late as March 22, 2016.  36. In view of the above, I find that ITC, by virtue of holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser and research analyst, without obtaining registration from SEBI, is in violation of Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3(1) of the IA and RA Regulations, respectively.  Issue No. 3: If answer to Issue No. 2 is in affirmative, who are liable for the violations committed?  37. I note that ITC is a partnership firm and has held itself out and acted as an investment adviser and research analyst. The details of the partners of ITC, as per partnership deed dated December 22, 2014, available on record, are as below:  Sl. No. Name of the Partner Capital and Share of Profit/ Loss 1 Pankaj Seth  1. All partners have contributed equal capital of Rs. 14,286/- each.  2. Profit/ loss shall be equally divided between the partners. 2 Vishal Anaji Girkar 3 Mohd. Zaid Siddique 4 Joheph Chand Malikhshaikh 5 Niwas A Kamble 6 Jagdish Lalmani Gupta 7 Girish Srichand Valecha  38. As per Section 25 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIPA\\\\\\\\u201d), \\\\\\\\u201cevery partner is liable jointly with all the other partners and also severally, for all acts of the firm done while he is a partner\\\\\\\\u201d. Section 25 of the IPA deals with situations where the act of the firm has caused loss/ injury to a third party. In this regard, reference can be also made to Sections 26, 27, 45, 48(b)(i) and 49 of the IPA which deal with the liability of the firm towards third parties. The liability of acting partners and non-acting partners (collectively known as firm) for injury to the third party is an outcome of joint and several liability of such partners under the IPA, irrespective__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Final Order in the matter of Indira Trading Company Page 16 of 20 of whether the conduct (act of the firm) which gave rise to the loss/injury to the third party falls is also a violation of any provision under securities law.  39. However, a partner who indulges in such conduct/ omission, is also liable under securities laws, if his act/ omission results in the violation of any provision under securities law. I note that for the contravention of law committed by the firm, apart from the firm, the partners of the firm who, at the time of contravention, were having knowledge of the said contravention or the partners whose neglect contributes to the contravention of law, are also liable for said contravention of law committed by the firm. The said principle is embodied in Sections 27(1) and 27(2) of SEBI Act.  40. I note from the partnership deed of ITC that all the partners have been referred to as working partners and all partners shall devote full time and attention in the conduct of the affairs of the firm as required. There is no material on record to indicate that any of the partners of ITC have taken any steps to prevent the firm from committing the violations observed against it. This is despite the fact that details of the unregistered services provided by ITC were placed on its website, which provided the partners sufficient opportunity to enquire into whether the compliance of the respective provisions, which ITC has been found to be in violation of, has been done or not. I note that neither did the Noticees provide any reply to the allegations made in the interim order nor did they avail the opportunity of personal hearing. In the absence of any of their submissions and in view of the provisions of Section 27 of the SEBI Act, I am constrained to hold that all the partners mentioned in the table above, are liable with ITC for their activities, for their respective tenures as partners, for contravention of provisions of the SEBI Act, the IA Regulations and the RA Regulations by ITC.  Issue No. 4: If answer to Issue No. 2 is in affirmative, then what directions need to be issued against those responsible for the violations?__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Final Order in the matter of Indira Trading Company Page 17 of 20 41.

Thus, power to take all measures necessary to discharge its duty under the statute which is a reflection of the objective disclosed in the preamble has been conferred in widest amplitude.  42.

APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  2. In the said matter the undersigned was initially appointed as the Adjudicating Officer (\\\\\\\\u2018AO\\\\\\\\u2019) by SEBI vide order dated July 4, 2016 under section 15 I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAdjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge the aforesaid allegations leveled against the Noticee under the provisions of section 15 HA of the SEBI Act. Pursuant to the transfer of the undersigned to another department of SEBI, Dr. Anitha Anoop was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, vide order dated March 18, 2019. Subsequently, due to the transfer of Dr. Anitha Anoop, the undersigned was once again appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, vide communique dated November 3, 2020.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  3.  Show Cause Notice dated December 20, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee  under Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules  to show-cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against the Noticee and penalty not be imposed on it under  Section 15HA of the SEBI Act for the alleged violation of the provisions of Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a) and (e) of PFUTP Regulations by the Noticee. The details in respect of the violation / non-compliance by the Noticee as observed from the SCN are as given below:  In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited                                                             Page 3 of 8   \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is alleged that a scheme was devised by MEL, the operators and the connected entities, including the Noticee by allotting shares on preferential allotment basis to various entities. It is alleged that the connected entities, including the Noticee increased the scrip price of MEL by placing the buy orders in the scrip at a price higher than the last traded price and also by absorbing the sell orders that were available in the market which were placed at a higher price than the Last Traded Price (LTP) in MEL. Once the scrip price of MEL reached the desired level, the preferential allottees exited and the preferential allottees have allegedly made a profit of Rs. 39 crore. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is observed that MEL made a preferential allotment of 92,30,000 shares to 48 entities on June 7, 2013 to raise an amount of Rs. 56.06 crore and the shares were under lock-in for one year upto June 06, 2014. It is observed that the shares were allotted on preferential basis initially at Rs. 25 per share and subsequently, the same was  revised to Rs. 60.74 (based on 26 week average price).  Post lock-in period, it was observed that 14 allottees who were allotted shares in the preferential allotment have either fully or partly sold their holdings in MEL i.e. 86,71,828 shares were sold in patches (i.e these shares were sold after the stock split period and approximately 9.30% of the shares allotted through the preferential allotment were sold by the preferential allottees for a value of Rs. 39 crore). Once the preferential allottees have started to exit, the scrip price of MEL started to decline substantially. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 During the investigation period, it is observed that a total of 1629 entities had traded in the scrip of MEL, out of which 60 entities were observed to be connected to the operators and also to the promoter/director of MEL. These connections were established during the course of the investigations on the basis of common address, email id, companies/directors related to the operators and through off market transfers. (hereinafter referred to as \"Connected entities\").  In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited                                                             Page 4 of 8   \\\\\\\\uf0b7 From the LTP (Last traded price) analysis and Trade/order log placed at Annexure-H carried out during the period when the scrip price of MEL had witnessed sharp rise i.e the patch 1 of the investigation period, it is observed that the entities related to the company/ operators were the major contributors to the LTP in the Price Rise Patch and contributed substantially to the price rise of the scrip by entering into transactions at prices higher than the last traded price. By carrying out such trades repeatedly, the connected entities established price higher than the last traded price to increase the price of the scrip during the price rise patch. \\\\\\\\uf0b7      It is alleged that the connected entities have contributed to the price rise of Rs. 1550.1 (net LTP) compared to the market Net LTP of Rs. 489.45. Further, it is observed that only 35 connected entities (of 60 entities) have contributed to positive LTP of Rs. 2777.80 which is 47% to market Positive LTP (Rs. 5875.95) in 2642 trades for a total volume of 11,44,294 shares. Further, the connected entities, bought 11.55 lac  shares which is 40.79% of the market volume (price rise-Patch I) and contributed to 47% of market positive LTP. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is observed that the Noticee is one of the top 10 connected entities who contributed to the Positive LTP. The details regarding the trades  of the Noticee is as under: Client Name Operator Net LTP Positive LTP Negative LTP Zero LTP % of +ve LTP to total market +ve LTP Net LTP (in Rs.) Traded qnty No. of trades +ve LTP (in Rs.) Traded qnty No. of trades Negative LTP (in Rs.) Traded qnty No. of trades Zero LTP traded quantity No. of trades Amanat Suppliers Pvt. Ltd. Devesh Upadhyay 48.3 17500 18 63.2 13575 11 -14.9 950 5 2975 17 1.08  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is alleged that the connected entities, including the Noticee repeatedly traded and significantly contributed to the price rise in the scrip of MEL during the period March, 2013 to August, 2014 by placing buy orders at a higher price than the last traded price. Further, it is alleged that  the top 10 connected entities carried out 346 trades during  In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited                                                             Page 5 of 8   the price rise patch of which in 283 trades, the sell order were placed first. The connected entities, including the Noticee placed the buy orders and absorbed the sell orders and increased the scrip price during the pre-split period i.e patch 1 of the investigation period. It is observed that in 135 trading days during the price rise period, (out of total 326 trading days) daily average volume of 750 shares and trades of 5 trades were carried out in  the scrip of MEL. Thus, with insignificant trades and average volume, artificial demand in the scrip of MEL was created by placing the buy orders at a price higher than the last traded price in the scrip. It is alleged that the scrip price of MEL was inflated and manipulated. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Thus, it is alleged that during the period when the scrip price of MEL witnessed increase, the connected entities, including the Noticee had contributed to the artificial price rise in the scrip of MEL by absorbing the sell orders that were available in the market which was at a higher price than the LTP which is evident from the net LTP of connected entities that is much higher than net LTP of market. These entities, including the Noticee created misleading appearance of price movement and attracted other investors which resulted in further price rise. The connected entities created artificial price rise and interest, thereby inducing other investors to trade in the scrip. Thereafter, once the price reached the desired level, the preferential allottees exited at a higher price and thereby booked profits. 4. I find that the Show Cause Notice dated December 20, 2016 which was issued to the Noticee had returned undelivered. In the interest of natural justice, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on July 3, 2019, vide hearing notice dated April 30, 2019. The notice could not be affixed at the last known address of the Noticee as the current residents refused affixture. Therefore, the email address of the Noticee was obtained  In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited                                                             Page 6 of 8   from the website of MCA and another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on August 18, 2020, vide email dated August 4, 2020 by the erstwhile Adjudicating Officer. However, the representatives on behalf of the Noticee failed to appear on the scheduled date of hearing. Thereafter, upon my appointment as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on January 21, 2021. However, the notice could neither be affixed nor could be served on the email address of the Noticee which was available as per records. 5. Thereafter, during the course of the proceedings, the status of the Noticee was ascertained from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) website. It was observed that the name of the Noticee has been struck off from the list of companies by the Registrar of Companies, Kolkata (RoC)  as on June 29, 2018. As per the Public Notice (Form No. STK-5), which was downloaded from the MCA website, a list of 10,650 companies were attached as per the Notification issued by ROC, Kolkata in terms of sub-section (1) of section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013. I find that the name of the Noticee was mentioned in the said list (at sl.no. 4063 under CIN No U51909WB2010PTC143430). The Notification downloaded from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India, (www.mca.gov.in) website inter alia, mentioned the following: \\\\\\\\u201cNotice is hereby given that the Registrar of Companies has a reasonable cause to believe that \\\\\\\\u2013  The following companies mentioned in Annexure A (:ist of 10, 650 nos. of companies enclosed) have not been carrying on any business or operation for a period of two immediately preceding financial years and have not made any application within such period for obtaining the status of dormant company under section 455 of the Companies Act, 2013. And, therefore, proposes to remove/ strike off the names of the above mentioned companies from the register of companies and dissolve them unless a cause is shown  In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited                                                             Page 7 of 8   to the contrary, within thirty days from the date of this notice. Any person objecting to the proposed removal/ striking off of name of companies from the register of companies may send his/ her objection to the office address mentioned here above within thirty days from the date of publication of this notice. 6. It is an established fact that when a company\\\\\\\\u2019s name is struck-off from the RoC list and the company is also dissolved, then it is a non-existing company and the adjudication proceedings against the non-existing company is thus nullity. In this context, I would like to draw reference to a judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) vs Vived Marketing Services (P) Ltd., ITA NO. 273/2009 dated September 17, 2009 in which it was held that - \\\\\\\\u201cWhen the Assessing Officer passed the order of assessment against the respondent company, it had already been dissolved and struck off the register of the Registrar of companies under Section 560 of the Companies Act. In these circumstances, the Tribunal rightly held that there could not have been any assessment order passed against the company which was not in existence as on that date in the eyes of law it had already been dissolved. We are of the opinion that the view taken by the Tribunal is perfectly valid and in accordance with law.\\\\\\\\u201d  7. Further, Black\\\\\\\\u2019s Law Dictionary explains \\\\\\\\u2018dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 as termination or winding up. It further clarifies that the dissolution of a corporation is the termination of its legal existence. Strike off essentially means removing the name of the company from the Register maintained by the Registrar of Companies. It is like closure of the company and the company will not be in existence after being struck- off and cannot perform any operations. 8. It is pertinent to note that, in the context of the alleged manipulation in the scrip of MEL, in exercise the powers conferred under sections 11(1), 11(4) & 11 B of the SEBI Act, an order dated June 26, 2020 has already been passed by SEBI against certain persons/entities, including the Noticee wherein SEBI had restrained the Noticee from accessing the securities market. Vide the said order, the Noticee was also prohibited from accessing  In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited                                                             Page 8 of 8   the securities market, directly or indirectly, and also restrained from buying, selling or dealing in securities, including units of mutual funds, either directly or indirectly, or in any other manner whatsoever, for a period of one year. 9. Therefore, in view of the facts and circumstances noted in the preceding paragraphs and also the fact that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been struck-off from the RoC list and also \\\\\\\\u2018dissolved\\\\\\\\u2019 as on June 29, 2018 as per the RoC notification, I conclude that the present adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee vide SCN dated December 20, 2016 cannot be proceeded with.  ORDER  10. In view of the above observations/findings and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against the Noticee viz. Amanat Suppliers Private Limited vide SCN dated December 20, 2016. 11.

An alert was generated at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) that certain entities were suspected to be indulging in front running the trades of 10 companies which belong to the same group (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018the Sterling Group\\\\\\\\u2019). In view of the same, Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) initiated an investigation into the matter for the period March 1, 2009 to March 31, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u2018Investigation period\\\\\\\\u2019), which focused on the front running of the trades of Sterling Group by several entities. As the same set of entities were also observed to be trading in considerable volumes on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), trades of these entities on BSE were also examined by SEBI. The investigation conducted by SEBI revealed that several entities were involved in the front running of trades of Sterling Group. The entities relevant to the case have been broadly segregated into three sub-groups:  a) 9 entities including Pinky Auto Finance Ltd (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Pinky Auto\\\\\\\\u2019 / \\\\\\\\u2018 Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019) which were, prima facie, observed to be front Front\\\\\\\\u2013Running by Manish Chaturvedi & Others                                                                 Page 2 of 8  running the trades of the Sterling Group/ its clients during the period under investigation,  b) 8 entities that aided/ abetted in the front running activities of the Entities mentioned at ( a) above c) 10 companies of the Sterling Group. 2. In view of the findings of the investigation report, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings against various persons/entities, including the Noticee under the provisions of section 15 HA of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2019SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2019) for their alleged violation of the provisions of Sections 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act read with Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4 (1) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities market) Regulations, 2003 (hereafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018PFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019).

Pursuant to the transfer of the undersigned to another department of SEBI, Dr. Anitha Anoop was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter vide order dated March 18, 2019. Subsequently, due to the transfer of Dr. Anitha Anoop, the undersigned was once again appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter vide communique dated November 3, 2020.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  4.  Show Cause Notice ref. SEBI/EAD-1/AA/ASR/478/2019 dated December 23, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee under Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules to show-cause as to why an inquiry should Front\\\\\\\\u2013Running by Manish Chaturvedi & Others                                                                 Page 3 of 8  not be initiated against the Noticee and penalty not be imposed upon it under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act for the alleged violation of the provisions of Sections 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act read with Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4 (1) of the PFUTP Regulations by the Noticee.  5. The details in respect of the violation / non-compliance by the Noticee as observed from the SCN are as given below:  a) Mr. Manish Manoharlal Chaturvedi / Noticee 1: Noticee 1 submitted to SEBI that he was involved in research and suggesting scrips for investment/ trading to Sterling Group's management. Noticee 1 was generally observed to be placing orders with the brokers on behalf of the Sterling Group after seeking approval from his seniors. As per the submissions of the Sterling Group, Noticee 1 was employed with the group from November 03, 2008 to November 08, 2011.  b) Mr. Praveen Kumar Jain / Noticee 13: Noticee 13 had financial transactions with all 7 frontrunners (i.e., other than Anandilal Chanda, his HUF and Sharekhan) and has facilitated banking transactions for the frontrunners through several entities which claimed to be involved in the business of diamond trading, investment etc. He stays in the same building as Manish Chaturvedi did during the investigation period.  c) Mr. Manoharlal Bhaiyalal Chaturvedi: Manoharlal Bhaiyalal Chaturvedi, father of Manish Chaturvedi was authorized to deal in the trading account of his wife Laxmi Chaturvedi.  d) Mrs. Laxmi Manoharlal Chaturvedi  Laxmi is Manish\\\\\\\\u2019s mother and front-running was observed in her account apart from receiving money from Praveen.   e) Mr. Bhavesh Gadhavi: Front-running was observed in his account besides multiple banking transactions with Praveen\\\\\\\\u2019s companies/ other companies in diamond trade.

He is also a cousin of Praveen.   i) Pinky Auto, E Ally, Jaisal Electronics, Viraj Mercantile, Josh Trading.  j) Front running was observed in these accounts apart from multiple banking transactions with companies related to Praveen.   k) Mrs. Madhu Chanda: Mrs. Madhu Chanda was a dealer of Sharekhan Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Sharekhan\\\\\\\\u2019) and submitted that she was heading the branch at second floor at the Lower Parel and was also handling all the accounts of 7 of the front-runners (mentioned at Sr. 1 to 7 at Para 3(i) above / Noticees 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12) at Sharekhan.   l) Mr. Anandilal Chanda :Mr. Anandilal Chanda (Madhu Chanda's husband) was observed to be front running in his own account, his HUF\\\\\\\\u2019s account and also in the proprietary account of Sharekhan.   m) Vishal Vijay Shah: A proprietary firm (registered member of BSE), provided false ledger statements/ documents/ bills for transactions on BSE in the account of Laxmi and Viraj Mercantile without registering them as clients and without execution of actual trades on BSE  n) It is alleged that three of the Noticees indulged in front running  consecutively i.e., in Noticee 12 / Bhavesh Gadhavi indulged in front running during the period July 16, 2009 to April 30, 2010, followed by Noticee 7 / Pinky Auto during the period May 07, 2010 to July 30, 2010 (except on one day i.e. May 17, 2010) and then by E Ally from August 03, 2010 to February 17, 2011.  o) It is alleged that the Noticees mentioned at Sr. 1 to 7 at Para 3(i) above / Noticees 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 had, prima facie,  front-run Sterling Group and Noticees at  Sr. 8 and 9 at Para 3(i) above / Noticees 15 and 16, had front-run clients of Sharekhan during the period March 2009 - March 2011. Further, these entities traded heavily on those scrip days which were common with the Sterling Group vis-\\\\\\\\xe0-vis trading in small volumes on other scrip days. Summary of client wise total trading activity of each of the frontrunner during the investigation period is provided at Page 1 of Annexure 7 and a consolidated summary of the same is tabulated below: Front\\\\\\\\u2013Running by Manish Chaturvedi & Others                                                                 Page 5 of 8  S.No Particulars Value 1 Total number of scrip days traded by the frontrunners 4,001 2 Number of scrip days of 1 above - common with Sterling group 833  3 Total profit on scrip days common with Sterling group \\\\\\\\u20b9 8,72,00,568 4 Total profits on other scrip days  (i.e., not common with Sterling group) \\\\\\\\u20b9 38,82,609 5 % of Number of Shares day traded on common scrip days to number of shares day traded during the investigation period 84.68% 6 % of Matching with the Sterling group compared to total number of share day traded by the frontrunners on common scrip days 85.95% 7 % of no. of trades matching with Sterling Group with same order price to total no. of trades matched  (including +/- \\\\\\\\u20b9 0.05 in case of Anandilal Chanda/ his HUF) 85.24% 8 % of average number of shares per trade with Sterling group to average number of shares per trade with others 2,424.14% 9 % of average value per trade with Sterling group to average value trade with others 2,941.26% 10 % of average turnover on scrip days common with Sterling Group to average turnover on other scrip days 3,465.75% 11 % of average Profit on scrip days common with Sterling Group to average profits on other scrip days 8,541.53%  p) Therefore, based on the above observations including the voice recording, pattern observed, phone calls between Manish and Madhu, matching of trades with the Sterling Group and the significant difference between the average value/ quantity of trades of the frontrunners that matched with the Sterling Group vis-\\\\\\\\xe0-vis the others and the amount of unfair gains earned by them, it is alleged that the trades of the Sterling Group were front-run in seven different accounts viz. Noticees 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12.  q) It is further alleged that these trades of the front-runners were executed based on the trades of the Sterling Group and only with an intention to square-off by matching with the Sterling Group. Considering the activity of the nine frontrunners (Laxmi Chaturvedi / Noticee 2, Viraj Mercantile Pvt. Ltd. / Noticee 4, Josh Trading Pvt. Ltd. / Noticee 6, Pinky Auto Finance Ltd. / Noticee 7, E Ally Consulting India Pvt. Ltd.  / Noticee 8, Shree Jaisal Electronics & Industries Ltd. / Noticee 10, Bhavesh Gadhavi / Noticee 12, Anandilal Chanda / Noticee 15 and Anandilal Chanda HUF/ Noticee 16) on the common scrip days, about 86% of number of shares day traded by the front-runners matched with the Sterling group, which appears to be on the basis of the prior information of trades of the Sterling Group available with Manish. Due to the trading by front runners, based on prior information of trades of Sterling Group, the investing public/investors have, prima facie, either incurred loss or have been deprived of the profits.  r) The aforesaid alleged violations, if established, make the Noticees, liable for monetary penalty under Sections 15 A(a), 15HA and 15HB of the SEBI Front\\\\\\\\u2013Running by Manish Chaturvedi & Others                                                                 Page 6 of 8  Act, wherever applicable  6. I find that the SCN dated December 23, 2019 which was issued to the  Noticee had returned undelivered from the address of the Noticee available with SEBI. Thereafter, the scanned copy of the SCN was sent to the email addresses of the Noticee. However, it is seen that despite the delivery of the SCN at the email  addresses of the Noticee,  no reply to the SCN was received from it. Subsequently, during the course of the proceedings, the status of the Noticee was ascertained from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)  website. It is observed that the name of the Noticee was changed from Pinky Auto Finance Limited to Golden Future  Capital  Limited. The name change of the Noticee to Golden Future Capital Limited was also verified from the website of the Income Tax Department, wherein the PAN of the Noticee viz.  AABCP1168J is  mapped with  the  new  name  of the Noticee viz. Golden Future Capital Limited. 7. It is also observed that vide notice no: ROCJP/STK/2256/, the name of the Noticee has been struck off from the list of companies by the Registrar of Companies, Jaipur (RoC) as on March 31, 2017. As per the  Notice  of Striking Off and Dissolution list (Form No. STK-5), which was downloaded from the MCA website, a list of 6044 companies were attached as per the Notification issued by ROC, Jaipur in terms of sub-sections (1) and (4) of section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013 and rule 7 of the Companies (Removal of Names of Companies from the Register of Companies) Rules, 2016. I find that the name of the Noticee was mentioned in the said list (at sl.no. 3280 under CIN No U65923RJ1997PLC013870). The Notification downloaded from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India, (www.mca.gov.in) website inter alia, mentioned the following:  \\\\\\\\u201cNotice is hereby given that the Registrar of Companies has a reasonable cause to  believe that \\\\\\\\u2013  (i) The following companies in Table \\\\\\\\u201cA\\\\\\\\u201d have not commenced business within one year of their incorporation.  (ii) The following companies in Table \\\\\\\\u201cA\\\\\\\\u201d have not been carrying on any business or operation for a period of two immediately preceding financial years and have not Front\\\\\\\\u2013Running by Manish Chaturvedi & Others                                                                 Page 7 of 8  made any application within such period for obtaining the status of dormant company under section 455. And, therefore, proposes to remove/strike off the names of the above mentioned companies from the register of companies and dissolve them unless a cause is shown to the contrary, within thirty days from the date of this notice.\\\\\\\\u201d 8. It is an established fact that when a company\\\\\\\\u2019s name is struck-off from the RoC list and the company is also dissolved, then it is a non-existing company and the adjudication proceedings against the non-existing company is thus nullity. In the instant matter, it is noted that the name of the Noticee was struck off from the records of RoC even before the appointment of Adjudicating Officer and issuance of SCN in the matter. In this context, I would like to draw reference to a judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) vs Vived Marketing Services (P) Ltd., ITA NO. 273/2009 dated September 17, 2009 in which it was held that - \\\\\\\\u201cWhen the Assessing Officer passed the order of assessment against the respondent company, it had already been dissolved and struck off the register of the Registrar of companies under Section 560 of the Companies Act. In these circumstances, the Tribunal rightly held that there could not have been any assessment order passed against the company which was not in existence as on that date in the eyes of law it had already been dissolved. We are of the opinion that the view taken by the Tribunal is perfectly valid and in accordance with law.\\\\\\\\u201d  9. Further, Black\\\\\\\\u2019s Law Dictionary explains \\\\\\\\u2018dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 as termination or winding up. It further clarifies that the dissolution of a corporation is the termination of its legal existence. Strike off essentially means removing the name of the company from the Register maintained by the Registrar of Companies. It is like closure of the company and the company will not be in existence after being struck- off and cannot perform any operations.  10. It is pertinent to note that, in the context of the alleged manipulation in the scrip of the company for the above referred investigation period, I note that in exercise of the powers conferred under sections 11(1), 11(4) & 11 B of the SEBI Act, an Order dated December 18, 2020 against various persons/entities, including the Noticee has already been passed by SEBI restraining the Noticee from accessing the securities market. Vide the said Front\\\\\\\\u2013Running by Manish Chaturvedi & Others                                                                 Page 8 of 8  order, the Noticee was prohibited from buying, selling or dealing in securities in any manner whatsoever, for a period of five years.   11.  Therefore, in view of the facts and circumstances noted in the preceding paragraphs and also the fact that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been struck-off from the RoC list and also \\\\\\\\u2018dissolved\\\\\\\\u2019 as on March 31, 2017 as per the RoC notification i.e. even before the appointment of AO and initiation of Adjudication proceedings, I conclude that the present adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee vide SCN dated December 23, 2019 cannot be proceeded with.  ORDER  12. In view of the above observations/findings and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings against the Noticee viz. Pinky Auto Finance Ltd (now known as Golden Future Capital Limited) initiated vide SCN dated December 23, 2019.  13.

WTM/PS/79/ERO/OCTOBER/2015 dated October 21, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \"Final Order\") against Falkon Industries India Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cFalkon\\\\\\\\u201d/ \\\\\\\\u201cCompany\\\\\\\\u201d) and its Directors, viz. Shri Manirul Islam, Shri Indraj Singh Jat, Shri Afzal Miah, Shri Biswajit Bhattacharya, Shri Dilwar Hossain, Shri Taslim Ansary, Shri Laxmanbhai Sitarambhai Bhoya, Shri Manglubhai Chilyabhai Dhum and Shri Budhan Chandra Kund.  2. The aforesaid Final Order inter alia made the following findings: 2.1. Falkon was incorporated on October 13, 2009, with the RoC, Kolkata, West Bengal having CIN No. as U19200WB2009PLC138866. Its registered office is at \\\\\\\\u201cF/27, Ground Floor, Katju Nagar, (130/198, Prince Golam Hossain Shah Road), Kolkata\\\\\\\\u2013 700032, West Bengal\\\\\\\\u201d.  Order in the matter of Falkon Industries India Limited                                                                           Page 2 of 20 2.2. Falkon had made an offer of Redeemable Preference Shares during the financial year 2009-10 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cOffer of RPS\\\\\\\\u201d) and raised at least an amount of Rs. 48.58 lakh from at least 714 allottees. The number of allottees and funds mobilized has been collated from documents obtained from MCA 21 portal i.e. FORM 2 (Return of allotment).  2.3. The above said Offer of RPS was found to be a deemed public issue of securities under the first proviso to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956. Accordingly, it was held that the resultant requirement under Section 60, Section 56(1) and 56(3), Sections 73(1), (2) and (3) of the Companies Act, 1956 were not complied with by Falkon and its Directors viz. Shri Manirul Islam, Shri Indraj Singh Jat, Shri Afzal Miah, Shri Biswajit Bhattacharya, Shri Dilwar Hossain, Shri Taslim Ansary, Shri Laxmanbhai Sitarambhai Bhoya, Shri Manglubhai Chilyabhai Dhum and Shri Budhan Chandra Kundu. 2.4. In view of the violations committed by Falkon and its aforementioned Directors, to safeguard the interest of the investors who had subscribed to such preference shares issued by Falkon and to further ensure orderly development of securities market, appropriate directions were issued against Falkon and its aforementioned Directors at paragraph 10.1 of the Final Order including a direction to refund the money collected by Falkon through the issuance of RPS, including the money collected from investors, till date, pending allotment of securities, if any, with an interest of 15% per annum compounded at half yearly intervals, from the date when the repayments became due to the investors till the date of actual payment. 3. Subsequently, it was noticed that Shri Akmal Sekh (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) who was also a Director of Falkon during the relevant period when Offer of RPS was made by Falkon, had not been made a party to the Final order dated October 21, 2015. Therefore, SEBI passed an interim order WTM/SR/SEBI \\\\\\\\u2013 ERO/IMD/180/11/2015 dated November 20, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cinterim order\\\\\\\\u201d) against the Noticee.  Order in the matter of Falkon Industries India Limited                                                                           Page 3 of 20 4. Prima facie findings/allegations: In the said interim order, the following prima facie findings were recorded:  4.1. SEBI vide an Order bearing no. WTM/PS/79/ERO/OCTOBER/2015 dated October 21, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \"Final Order\"), passed certain directions as mentioned at paragraph 10.1 thereof, against Falkon and its Directors for violating the provisions of Section 56, Section 60 read with Section 2(36), Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956 read with Section 27(2) of the SEBI Act, by engaging in fund mobilising activity from the public, through the issue of RPS. 4.2. As per the findings contained in the Final Order, the offer and allotment of RPS made by Falkon to 714 investors during the financial year 2009\\\\\\\\u201310, has been held to be a public issue of securities in accordance with the first proviso to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956.  4.3. It has come to SEBI's notice that the Noticee was earlier a Director of Falkon during the Offer of RPS. His directorship in the Falkon was from October 13, 2009 to September 24, 2012. 4.4. It is observed that the Noticee was also engaged in fund mobilising activity from the public, in his capacity as a Director of Falkon, through the Offer of RPS and as a result of the aforesaid activity, has violated Section 56, Section 60 read with Section 2(36), Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956 read with Section 27(2) of the SEBI Act.   5. In view of the prima facie findings on the violations, the following directions were issued in the said interim order dated November 20, 2015 against the Noticee with immediate effect.  i. The past Director of Falkon, viz. Shri Akmal Sekh (PAN: BZMPS1847R; DIN: 02502409) is prohibited from issuing prospectus or any offer document or issue advertisement for soliciting money from the public for the issue of securities, in any manner whatsoever, either directly or indirectly, till further orders; ii. The abovementioned past Director of Falkon is restrained from accessing the securities market and further prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise dealing  Order in the matter of Falkon Industries India Limited                                                                           Page 4 of 20 in the securities market, either directly or indirectly, till further directions; iii. The abovementioned past Director of Falkon shall provide a full inventory of all his assets and properties. 6. The interim order also show caused the abovementioned past Director of Falkon as to why suitable directions / prohibitions under Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11A and 11B of the SEBI Act, Section 73(2) of the Companies Act read with Section 27(2) of the SEBI Act including the following, should not be taken/imposed against him:  i. Directing him jointly and severally to refund money collected through the Offer of Preference Shares alongwith interest, if any, promised to investors therein; ii. Directing him not to issue prospectus or any offer document or issue advertisement for soliciting money from the public for the issue of securities, in any manner whatsoever, either directly or indirectly, for an appropriate period;  iii. Directing him to refrain from accessing the securities market and prohibiting him from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities for an appropriate period. 7. Vide the said interim order, the abovementioned Director was given the opportunity to file his reply, within 21 days from the date of receipt of the said interim order. The order further stated that he may also indicate whether he desired to avail an opportunity of personal hearing on a date and time to be fixed on a specific request made in that regard.  8. Service of Interim Order: The copy of the said interim order was sent to the Noticee vide letter dated November 23, 2015. However, proof of service of the interim order is not available on record.  9. Thereafter, vide notification dated January 12, 2021 published in newspaper Times of India, Kolkata edition; notification dated January 12, 2021 published in newspaper Sanmarg and notification dated January 12, 2021 published in newspaper Sangbad Pratidin, Noticee was notified by SEBI (the aforesaid notifications got published in the respective newspapers on January 18, 2021), that interim order dated November 20, 2015 was issued against him and was advised to download from the website of SEBI (www.sebi.gov.in) or collect the copy of said interim order from SEBI, Eastern Regional Office, Kolkata within ten days from the notification. Further, the Noticee  Order in the matter of Falkon Industries India Limited                                                                           Page 5 of 20 was also notified by SEBI that he will be given the opportunity of being heard on February 2, 2021 through Webex. 10. It is noted that the Noticee has neither submitted a reply in the matter nor attended the scheduled hearing in the matter.  Consideration of Issues and Findings 11. I have considered the allegations and materials available on record. On perusal of the same, the following issues arise for consideration. Each question is dealt with separately under different headings. 11.1. Issue No. 1 - Whether the company came out with the Offer of RPS? 11.2. Issue No. 2 - If so, whether the said offer was in violation of Section 56, Section 60 and Section 73 of Companies Act 1956? 11.3. Issue No. 3 - If the findings on the aforesaid issue no. 2 are found in the affirmative, whether the Noticee is liable for the violations committed? Issue No. 1- Whether the company came out with the Offer of RPS? 12. I have perused the interim order dated November 23, 2015 and I note that the Noticee has not filed any reply disputing the same.   13. I have also perused the documents/ information obtained from the 'MCA 21 Portal' other documents available on records. It is noted, from the records from MCA, that Falkon has issued and allotted RPS to 714 investors during the financial year 2009-10 and raised an amount of Rs. 48.58 lakh. I also note that the number of allottees and funds mobilized has been collated from the documents collected from the documents / information obtained from the MCA 21 Portal.   14. I therefore conclude that Falkon came out with an offer of RPS as outlined above. The same has also been decided vide Final Order dated October 21, 2015. Issue No. 2- If so, whether the said offer was in violation of Section 56, Section 60 and Section 73 of Companies Act 1956. 15. The provisions alleged to have been violated and mentioned in Issue No. 2 are applicable to the Offer of RPS made to the public. Therefore, the primary question  Order in the matter of Falkon Industries India Limited                                                                           Page 6 of 20 that arises for consideration is whether the issue of RPS is a \\\\\\\\u2018public issue\\\\\\\\u2019.  At this juncture, reference may be made to Sections 67(1) and 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956:   \"67. (1) Any reference in this Act or in the articles of a company to offering shares or debentures to the public shall, subject to any provision to the contrary contained in this Act and subject also to the provisions of sub-sections (3) and (4), be construed as including a reference to offering them to any section of the public, whether selected as members or debenture holders of the company concerned or as clients of the person issuing the prospectus or in any other manner.   (2) any reference in this Act or in the articles of a company to invitations to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures shall, subject as aforesaid, be construed as including a reference to invitations to subscribe for them extended to any section of the public, whether selected as members or debenture holders of the company concerned or as clients of the person issuing the prospectus or in any other manner.  (3) No offer or invitation shall be treated as made to the public by virtue of sub- section (1) or sub- section (2), as the case may be, if the offer or invitation can properly be regarded, in all the circumstances-  (a) as not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation; or (b) otherwise as being a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer or invitation \\\\\\\\u2026  Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall apply in a case where the offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or debentures is made to fifty persons or more:  Provided further that nothing contained in the first proviso shall apply to nonbanking financial companies or public financial institutions specified in section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956).\\\\\\\\u201d   16. The following observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited & Ors. vs. SEBI (Civil Appeal no. 9813 and 9833 of 2011) (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cSahara Case\\\\\\\\u201d), while examining the scope of Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956, are worth consideration: -  Order in the matter of Falkon Industries India Limited                                                                           Page 7 of 20 \\\\\\\\u201cSection 67(1) deals with the offer of shares and debentures to the public and Section 67(2) deals with invitation to the public to subscribe for shares and debentures and how those expressions are to be understood, when reference is made to the Act or in the articles of a company. The emphasis in Section 67(1) and (2) is on the \\\\\\\\u201csection of the public\\\\\\\\u201d. Section 67(3) states that no offer or invitation shall be treated as made to the public, by virtue of subsections (1) and (2), that is to any section of the public, if the offer or invitation is not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation or otherwise as being a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer or invitations. Section 67(3) is, therefore, an exception to Sections 67(1) and (2). If the circumstances mentioned in clauses (1) and (b) of Section 67(3) are satisfied, then the offer/invitation would not be treated as being made to the public.   The first proviso to Section 67(3) was inserted by the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2000 w.e.f. 13.12.2000, which clearly indicates, nothing contained in Sub-section (3) of Section 67 shall apply in a case where the offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or debentures is made to fifty persons or more. \\\\\\\\u2026 Resultantly, after 13.12.2000, any offer of securities by a public company to fifty persons or more will be treated as a public issue under the Companies Act, even if it is of domestic concern or it is proved that the shares or debentures are not available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation.\\\\\\\\u201d  17. Section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956 provides for situations when an offer is not considered as offer to public. As per the said sub section, if the offer is one which is not calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation, or, if the offer is the domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer, the same are not considered as public offer. Under such circumstances, they are considered as private placement of shares and debentures. It is noted that as per the first proviso to Section 67(3) Companies Act, 1956, the public offer and listing requirements contained in that Act would become automatically applicable to a company making the offer to fifty or more persons.  Order in the matter of Falkon Industries India Limited                                                                           Page 8 of 20 However, the second proviso to Section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956 exempts NBFCs and Public Financial Institutions from the applicability of the first proviso.    18. In the instant matter, I find that RPS were issued by Falkon to 714 investors in the financial year 2009-10. I find that Falkon has mobilized an amount of Rs. 48.58 lakh over the financial year 2009-10. The above findings lead to a reasonable conclusion that the Offer of RPS by Falkon was a \\\\\\\\u201cpublic issue\\\\\\\\u201d within the meaning of the first proviso to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956.  19. I find that Falkon has not claimed to be a non\\\\\\\\u2013banking financial company or public financial institution within the meaning of Section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956. In view of the aforesaid, I, therefore, find that there is no case that Falkon is covered under the second proviso to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956.  20. The Noticee has not contended that the Offer of RPS does not fall within the ambit of first proviso of Section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956.   21. Even in cases where the allotments are considered separately, reference may be made to Sahara Case, wherein it was held that under Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956, the \"Burden of proof is entirely on Saharas to show that the investors are/were their employees/workers or associated with them in any other capacity which they have not discharged.\" In respect of those issuances, the Directors have not placed any material that the allotment was in satisfaction of Section 67(3)(a) or 67(3)(b) of Companies Act, 1956 i.e., it was made to the known associated persons or domestic concern. Therefore, I find that the said issuance cannot be considered as private placement. Moreover, reference may be made to the order dated April 28, 2017 of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSAT\\\\\\\\u201d) in Neesa Technologies Limited vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 311 of 2016) which lays down that \\\\\\\\u201cIn terms of Section 67(3) of the Companies Act any issue to \\\\\\\\u201850 persons or more\\\\\\\\u2019 is a public issue and all public issues have to comply with the provisions of Section 56 of Companies Act and ILDS Regulations. Accordingly, in the instant matter the appellant have violated these provisions and their argument that they have issued the NCDs in multiple tranches and no tranche has exceeded 49 people has no meaning\\\\\\\\u201d.   22. Therefore, in view of the material available on record, I find that the Offer of RPS by  Order in the matter of Falkon Industries India Limited                                                                           Page 9 of 20 Falkon falls within the first proviso of Section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956. Hence, the Offer of RPS are deemed to be public issues and Falkon was mandated to comply with the 'public issue' norms as prescribed under the Companies Act, 1956. The same has also been decided vide Final Order dated October 21, 2015.  23. Further, since the offer of RPS is a public issue of securities, such securities shall also have to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, as mandated under Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956. As per Sections 73(1) and (2) of the Companies Act, 1956, a company is required to make an application to one or more recognized stock exchanges for permission for the shares or debentures to be offered to be dealt with in the stock exchange and if permission has not been applied for or not granted, the company is required to forthwith repay with interest all moneys received from the applicants.  24. The allegations of non-compliance of the above provisions were not denied by the Noticee. I also find that no records have been submitted to indicate that the company has made an application seeking listing permission from stock exchange or refunded the amounts on account of such failure. Therefore, I find that Falkon has contravened the said provisions. The Noticee has not provided any records to show that the amount collected by Falkon is kept in a separate bank account. Therefore, I find that Falkon has also not complied with the provisions of Section 73(3) of the Companies Act, 1956 which mandates that the amounts received from investors shall be kept in a separate bank account. Therefore, I find, that Section 73(2) of the Companies Act, 1956 has not been complied with. The same has also been decided vide Final Order dated October 21, 2015.  25. Section 2(36) of the Companies Act, 1956 read with Section 60 thereof, mandates a company to register its 'prospectus' with the RoC, before making a public offer/ issuing the 'prospectus'. As per the aforesaid Section 2(36) of the Companies Act, 1956, \\\\\\\\u201cprospectus\\\\\\\\u201d means any document described or issued as a prospectus and includes any notice, circular, advertisement or other document inviting deposits from the public or inviting offers from the public for the subscription or purchase of any shares in, or debentures of, a body corporate. As the offer of RPS was a deemed  Order in the matter of Falkon Industries India Limited                                                                           Page 10 of 20 public issue of securities, Falkon was required to register a prospectus with the RoC under Section 60 of the Companies Act, 1956. I find that the Noticee has not submitted any record to indicate that Falkon has registered a prospectus with the RoC, in respect of the offer of RPS. I, therefore, find that Falkon has not complied with the provisions of Section 60 of the Companies Act, 1956. The same has also been decided vide Final Order dated October 21, 2015. 26. In terms of Section 56(1) of the Companies Act, 1956, every prospectus issued by or on behalf of a company, shall state the matters specified in Part I and set out the reports specified in Part II of Schedule II of that Act. Further, as per Section 56(3) of the Companies Act, 1956, no one shall issue any form of application for shares in a company, unless the form is accompanied by abridged prospectus, containing disclosures as specified. The Noticee has not produced any record to show that Falkon has issued prospectus containing the disclosures mentioned in Section 56(1) of the Companies Act, 1956, or issued application forms accompanying the abridged prospectus. Therefore, I find that, Falkon has not complied with Sections 56(1) and 56(3) of the Companies Act, 1956. The same has also been decided vide Final Order dated October 21, 2015.  27. Further, I note that the jurisdiction of SEBI over various provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 including the above mentioned, in the case of public companies, whether listed or unlisted, when they issue and transfer securities, flows from the provisions of Section 55A of the Companies Act, 1956. While examining the scope of Section 55A of the Companies Act, 1956, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Sahara Case, had observed that:  \"We, therefore, hold that, so far as the provisions enumerated in the opening portion of Section 55A of the Companies Act, so far as they relate to issue and transfer of securities and non-payment of dividend is concerned, SEBI has the power to administer in the case of listed public companies and in the case of those public companies which intend to get their securities listed on a recognized stock exchange in India.\"  \"SEBI can exercise its jurisdiction under Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11A(1)(b) and 11B of SEBI Act and Regulation 107 of ICDR 2009 over public companies who have issued  Order in the matter of Falkon Industries India Limited                                                                           Page 11 of 20 shares or debentures to fifty or more, but not complied with the provisions of Section 73(1) by not listing its securities on a recognized stock exchange\"  28. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that by virtue of Section 55A of the Companies Act, 1956, SEBI has to administer Section 67 of that Act, so far as it relates to issue and transfer of securities, in the case of companies who intend to get their securities listed. While interpreting the phrase \\\\\\\\u201cintend to get listed\\\\\\\\u201d in the context of deemed public issue the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in Sahara Case observed-   \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026But then, there is also one simple fundamental of law, i.e. that no-one can be presumed or deemed to be intending something, which is contrary to law. Obviously therefore, \\\\\\\\u201cintent\\\\\\\\u201d has its limitations also, confining it within the confines of lawfulness\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026Listing of securities depends not upon one\\\\\\\\u2019s volition, but on statutory mandate\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026The appellant-companies must be deemed to have \\\\\\\\u201cintended\\\\\\\\u201d to get their securities listed on a recognized stock exchange, because they could only then be considered to have proceeded legally. That being the mandate of law, it cannot be presumed that the appellant companies could have \\\\\\\\u201cintended\\\\\\\\u201d, what was contrary to the mandatory requirement of law\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  29. In view of the above findings, I am of the view that Falkon was engaged in fund mobilizing activity from the public, through the offer of RPS and has contravened the provisions of Sections 56(1), 56(3), 2(36) read with 60, 73(1), 73(2), 73(3) of the Companies Act, 1956. The same has also been decided vide Final Order dated October 21, 2015. Issue No. 3- If the findings on Issue No. 2 are found in the affirmative, whether Noticee is liable for the violations committed? 30. I note that the Noticee did not make any submissions with respect to his appointment, resignation and tenure of directorship in Falkon.  31. From the MCA records, the details his appointment and resignation is as follows:  Sl. No. Name of the Director  Designation Date of Appointment  Date of Cessation 1 Akmal Sekh Director October 13, 2009 September 24, 2012  Order in the matter of Falkon Industries India Limited                                                                           Page 12 of 20 32. Sections 56(1) and 56(3) read with Section 56(4) of the Companies Act, 1956 imposes the liability on the company, every Director, and other persons responsible for the prospectus for the compliance of the said provisions. The liability for non-compliance of Section 60 of the Companies Act, 1956 is on the company, and every person who is a party to the non-compliance of issuing the prospectus as per the said provision. Therefore, the Noticee being the Director of Falkon during the financial year 2009-10 when the Offer of RPS was made by Falkon, is liable for the violation of Sections 56(1), 56(3) and 60 of the Companies Act, 1956. 33. As far as the liability for non-compliance of Section 73 of Companies Act, 1956 is concerned, as stipulated in Section 73(2) of the said Act, the company and every Director of the company who is an officer in default shall, from the eighth day when the company becomes liable to repay, be jointly and severally liable to repay that money with interest at such rate, not less than four per cent and not more than fifteen per cent if the money is not repaid forthwith. With regard to liability to pay interest, I note that as per Section 73 (2) of the Companies Act, 1956, the company and every Director of the company who is an officer in default is jointly and severally liable, to repay all the money with interest at prescribed rate. In this regard, I note that in terms of Rule 4D of the Companies (Central Governments) General Rules and Forms, 1956, the rate of interest prescribed in this regard is 15%.  34. As per Section 5 of Companies Act, 1956, \\\\\\\\u201cofficer who is in default\\\\\\\\u201d means (a) the Managing Director/s; (b) the Whole-Time Director/s; (c) the manager; (d) the secretary; (e) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the Board of Directors of the company is accustomed to act; (f) any person charged by the Board with the responsibility of complying with that provision; (g) where any company does not have any of the officers specified in clauses (a) to (c), any Director or Directors who may be specified by the Board in this behalf or where no Director is so specified, all the Directors. 35. In this regard, I note that Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT vide order dated February 14, 2019 in the matter of Pritha Bag vs. SEBI stated that \\\\\\\\u201c...Unless and until a finding is given that the appellant is an officer in default, the mandate provided under Section 73(2) cannot be  Order in the matter of Falkon Industries India Limited                                                                           Page 13 of 20 invoked against the appellant. In the instant case, the appellant has annexed documents to indicate that the company had a managing director, namely, Mr. Indranath Daw and, therefore, as per the provisions of Section 5 the managing director would be an officer in default. We also find that there is no finding given by the WTM that the appellant was the managing director or whole time director or was a person charged by the Board with the responsibility of compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act and, consequently, could not be made responsible for refunding the amount under Section 73(2). Reliance on the judgment of this Court by the respondent in the case of Manoj Agarwal vs. SEBI in Appeal No. 66 of 2016 decided on July 14, 2017 is not applicable and is distinguishable. The Tribunal in the case of Manoj Agarwal found that there was no material to show that any of the officers set out in clauses (a) to (c) of Section 5 or any specified director of the said company was entrusted to discharge the application contained in Section 73 of the Companies Act. In the instant case, there is sufficient material on record to show that there was a managing director and in the absence of any finding that the appellant was entrusted to discharge the application contained in Section 73 of the Companies Act, the direction to refund the amount alongwith interest from the appellant is wholly illegal...\\\\\\\\u201d 36.  Further, it is pertinent to note the observation of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT vide Order dated July 14, 2017 in the matter of Manoj Agarwal vs. SEBI, that: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 In view of the fact that out of the amount of Rs.99.06 lakh, amount of Rs.59.06 lakh was collected by BREDL after the appellant ceased to be a Director of BREDL, counsel for SEBI fairly stated on instruction that the obligation of the appellant to refund the amount with interest jointly and severally with BREDL and other Directors set out in the impugned order may be limited to Rs.40 lakh only, because, that was the amount collected by BREDL during the period when the appellant was a Director of BREDL\\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026Section 5 of the Companies Act, 1956 defines the expression \\\\\\\\u2018officer who is in default\\\\\\\\u2019 to mean the officers named therein. Section 5(g) provides that where any company does not have any of the officers specified in clauses (a) to (c) of Section 5, then any director who may be specified by the Board in that behalf or where no director is so specified  Order in the matter of Falkon Industries India Limited                                                                           Page 14 of 20 then all the directors would be \\\\\\\\u201cofficer who is in default\\\\\\\\u201d. In the present case, no material is brought on record to show that any of the officers set out in clauses (a) to (c) of Section 5 or any specified director of BREDL was entrusted to discharge the obligation contained in Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956. In such a case, as per Section 5(g) of the Companies Act, 1956 BREDL and all the directors of BREDL are liable... Fact that appellant had merely lent his name to be a director of BREDL at the instance of Mr. Soumen Majumder and for becoming a director of BREDL the appellant had neither paid any subscription money to BREDL and the fact that the appellant was not involved in the day to day affairs of BREDL would not absolve the appellant from his obligation to refund the amount to the investors in view of the specific provisions contained in Section 73(2) read with Section 5 of the Companies Act, 1956. Admittedly, the appellant was a director of BREDL when amounts were collected by BREDL in contravention of the public issue norms and there is nothing on record to suggest that any particular officer/director was authorised to comply with the public issue norms. In such a case, all directors of BREDL including the appellant would be \\\\\\\\u201cofficer in default\\\\\\\\u201d under Section 73(2) read with Section 5 of the Companies Act, 1", "Date": "2021-02-26", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Final Order against Mr. Akmal Sekh in the matter of Falkon Industries India Ltd.", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/feb-2021/final-order-against-mr-akmal-sekh-in-the-matter-of-falkon-industries-india-ltd-_49318.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 60162, "unique_record_id": "7ea5f8909aSEBI20210226", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "66813cc07858910306472182", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 11:08:18", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Non-compliance", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "Rs. 48.58 lakh", "gpt_audience": "1.

Pursuant to the transfer of Shri B. J. Dilip to another department of the SEBI, the undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter by SEBI vide Communique dated December 31, 2020.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 3. Show Cause Notice dated October 16, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticees under the provisions of Rule 4(1) of the AO Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against the Noticees and why penalty, if any, should not be imposed on the Noticees under the provisions of Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act for the alleged violations of the provisions of Section 11C(2) read with Section 11C(3) of the SEBI Act, by the Noticees. The following charges were levelled against the Noticees in the SCN:  a) During the course of investigation, Investigating Authority of SEBI issued summons to the Noticees 1 & 2 under Section 11C(2) and 11C(3) of SEBI Act, on various dates i.e. June 8, 2016, June 28, 2016 and July 4, 2018, seeking information about their relation with Mr. Neeleshkumar Lahoti, Future Fintrade, Mr. Mohsin, Gautam Sanjay Khandelwal, Vinit Enterprises, STML, etc. and details of their directors were also sought. Further, they were also asked to explain in detail the reason for fund transfer to Gautam Sanjay Khandelwal.  b) Vide their reply dated nil, received on July 18, 2018, it was submitted that the Noticees 1 & 2 are sister concern with the same directors. Further, it was also submitted that they have done the business of providing accommodation entries, and __________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 3 of 13  they have given cheques and received cash against the same. They have earned commission of 0.15% on providing entries. However, they did not provide the complete information sought in the summons. c) Further, summons under section 11C(2) and 11C(3) of SEBI Act, were issued to the Noticees 1 & 2 dated July 19, 2018 and August 8, 2018, seeking information about their relation with Gautam Sanjay Khandelwal, Vinit Enterprises etc. and they were also asked to provide complete details of the entity/ entities who provided them cash against cheques as mentioned in their aforesaid reply. However, the Noticees 1 & 2 failed to provide the requisite information. The details of summons sent to the Noticees 1 & 2 are as follows:  Table \\\\\\\\u2013 1: Name of entity Date of issuance of summons u/s 11C(2) and 11C(3) to furnish information July 19, 2018,  August 8, 2018 Jesse Trading Private Limited and  Nikita Enterprise Private Limited Delivered Acknowledgement -August 2, 2018 Delivered Acknowledgement - August  13, 2018  d) Vide letter dated January 8, 2019, Mr. Dharmendra Harilal Bhojak who is one of the directors in the Noticees 1 & 2, submitted that he worked for Mr. Satish R. Mandora who made him sign on some documents. He further submitted that he does not know anything and do not have any relation with the Noticees 1 & 2.    e) It is observed that the Noticees 1 & 2 did not provide complete information sought vide summons issued to them and thereby did not co-operate in the investigation (Non-furnishing of information by them hampered the investigation since in the absence of the same, the exact nature of their funding to Gautam Sanjay Khandelwal and the identity of entities from whom they received the cash could not be established and investigation had to be concluded based on the available information/ documents. In view of this, it is alleged that the Noticees 1 & 2 had violated the provisions of Section 11C(2) and 11C (3) of SEBI Act, 1992.   4. The SCN was sent via Speed Post Acknowledgement Due (\\\\\\\\u2018SPAD\\\\\\\\u2019) to the last known addresses of the Noticees as well as through digitally signed email dated October 19, 2020. SCN was duly served upon the Noticees through email. The Noticees were granted time of fifteen (15) days to file their replies to the SCN. __________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 4 of 13  However, no reply to the SCN was received. Thereafter, in the interest of natural justice, vide digitally signed email dated November 24, 2020, the Noticees were granted an opportunity of personal hearing in the matter before the erstwhile AO on December 15, 2020. Vide aforesaid email, the Noticees were also advised to file their replies/ submissions in respect of the SCN latest by December 11, 2020. However, the Noticees neither filed any reply to the SCN nor attended the scheduled hearing. Thereafter, the matter was transferred to the undersigned. In view of the change in the adjudicating authority and in the interest of the natural justice, vide hearing notice dated January 20, 2021, the Noticees were granted another opportunity of personal hearing before the undersigned on February 04, 2021. The aforesaid hearing notices were sent through email dated January 20, 2021 and were duly served upon the Noticees. Vide aforesaid hearing notices, the Noticees were also advised to file their replies/ submissions in respect of the SCNs on or before date of hearing. However, the Noticees failed to submit their replies to the SCNs and did not attend the second hearing on February 04, 2021. Thereafter, vide notice dated February 15, 2021, the Noticees were granted final opportunities of personal hearing before the undersigned on February 18, 2021. The aforesaid notices were sent to the Noticees through digitally signed emails and were duly delivered. However, the Noticees did not attend the scheduled hearing.  5. In view of the above, I am compelled to proceed ex parte in the matter against the Noticees. I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been complied with since sufficient opportunities have been provided to the Noticees to submit their replies and to appear for personal hearing. I, therefore, am of the view that the Noticees have nothing to submit and in terms of rule 4(7) of the Adjudication Rules, the matter can be proceeded ex-parte on the basis of material available on record. Therefore, the present proceedings against the Noticees are undertaken ex-parte on the basis of available documents and information. __________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 5 of 13   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS  6. I have carefully perused the documents/ evidence available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are:  (a) Whether the Noticees have violated the provisions of Section 11C(2) read with Section 11C(3) of the SEBI Act? (b) Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act?  (c) If yes, what should be the quantum of penalty?   7. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of the SEBI Act:  Investigation. 11C (1) \\\\\\\\u2026. 11C. (2) Without prejudice to the provisions of sections 235 to 241 of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), it shall be the duty of every manager, managing director, officer and other employee of the company and every intermediary referred to in section 12 or every person associated with the securities market to preserve and to produce to the Investigating Authority or any person authorised by it in this behalf, all the books, registers, other documents and record of, or relating to, the company or, as the case may be, of or relating to, the intermediary or such person, which are in their custody or power.

I note that the first issue for consideration is whether the Noticees have violated the provisions of Section 11C(2) read with Section 11C(3) of the SEBI Act. I note from the relevant records that during the course of investigation, the IA issued summonses dated June 08, 2018, to the Noticees, inter alia, seeking the following information: a) Details of all directors of the Noticees from January 01, 2016 to date of summonses.

Mr. Neeleshkumar Lahoti, Future Fintrade, Mr. Mohsin, Gautam Sanjay Khandelwal, Vinit Enterprises, STML, Preyesh Mehta, Jesse Trading Private Limited, Nikita Enterprises Private Limited and STML etc. and details of their directors; d) The reason for fund transfers to the entity, Mr. Gautam Sanjay Khandelwal.  The Noticees were required to submit information sought for in the aforesaid summonses latest by June 22, 2018.  9. Thereafter, vide the second summons dated June 28, 2018, the Noticees were again advised by the IA to furnish information sought for in the summons dated June 08, 2018, by July 06, 2018. I note that both the summonses, dated June 08, 2018 and June 28, 2018, were duly delivered to the Noticees. The Noticees, vide their letters (received by SEBI on June 29, 2018) requested for more time to file replies to the summonses.   10. Vide summons dated July 04, 2018, the Noticees were advised to provide the information sought for vide the earlier summonses dated June 08, 2018 and __________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 7 of 13  June 28, 2018, by July 11, 2018. In response, vide letters of the Noticees, (received by SEBI on July 18, 2018), the Noticees, inter alia, submitted as under-  i. The Noticees are sister concern with same directors. ii. They have done the business of providing accommodation entries and they have given checks and receive cash against the same. iii. They have earned commission of 0.15% on providing entries.  The Noticees also submitted copies of PAN and Aadhar cards of two (2) of their directors. Further, vide letters of the Noticees (received by SEBI on July 19, 2018), the Noticees submitted their directorship details, and copies Bank Account Statements of following two (2) bank accounts-  Bank Description Jesse Trading Private Limited Nikita Enterprises Private Limited Axis Bank  Account No. 913020009444491 913020007240554 Period (April 02, 2016 to October 15, 2016) (April 02, 2016 to October 15, 2016) Saraswat Co-operative Bank Ltd. Account No. 005100101000205 005100101000193 Period (April 01, 2016 to March 31, 2017) (April 01, 2016 to March 31, 2017)  11. Thereafter, the IA issued summons dated July 19, 2018, to the Noticees, seeking the following information:  i. Details of all directors of the Noticees from January 01, 2016 to date of summons; ii. Details of all bank accounts held by the Noticees along with Bank Account statements; iii. The Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 relations with other entities, viz. Mr. Neeleshkumar Lahoti, Future Fintrade, Mr. Mohsin, Gautam Sanjay Khandelwal, Vinit Enterprises, STML, Preyesh Mehta and STML etc. iv. Reason for fund transfers to the entity Mr. Gautam Sanjay Khandelwal. v. Complete details of entities who provided cash to the Noticees against cheques as per their earlier replies.  vi.

The Notices were advised to file their replies by July 26, 2018. Thereafter, the IA issued another summons dated August 08, 2018 to the Noticees and advised them to furnish information sought for in the summons dated July 19, 2018, by August 14, 2018. I note that the summonses dated July 19 and August 08, 2018 were duly delivered to the Noticees. However, the Noticees did not file their replies to the aforesaid summonses.  13. I note from the records that the Noticees submitted the directorship details and statements of two (2) bank accounts of each of the Noticees as mentioned in Paragraph 10 above of this order. On perusal of the directorship details of the Noticees, it is observed that both the Noticees had three directors viz. (i). Mr. Satish Mandowara (ii) Mr. Dharmendra Bhojak and (iii) Mr. Anil Lahoti. The Noticees also submitted copies of PAN and Aadhar Cards (consisting addresses of the Noticees) of two of the aforesaid directors, i.e., Mr. Satish Mandowara and Mr. Dharmendra Bhojak. However, I note that the Noticees failed to submit PAN and Address of the third director, viz. Mr. Anil Lahoti. The Noticees also failed to confirm whether they were any other directors during the period January 01, 2016 to date of issuance of summonses, and who had resigned, as sought for in the summonses. I also note that the Noticees furnished information in respect of two (2) bank accounts held by each of them, along with Bank Account statements. However, they failed to inform IA about number of total bank accounts, along with the details, held by each of them. Thus, I find that the Noticees did not submit complete reply to the first and second questions of the summonses issued by the IA.  14. Apart from this, I find that the Noticees have also failed to submit the following information which was sought for in the summonses- A. The Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 relations with other entities, viz. Mr. Neeleshkumar Lahoti, Future Fintrade, Mr. Mohsin, Gautam Sanjay Khandelwal, Vinit Enterprises, STML, Preyesh Mehta and STML etc. __________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 9 of 13  B. Reason for fund transfers to the entity Mr. Gautam Sanjay Khandelwal. C. Complete details of entities who provided cash to the Noticees against cheques as per their earlier replies.  Thus, I find that the Noticees failed to furnish the complete information sought for in the aforesaid summonses issued by the IA.  15. I note from the records that vide a letter addressed to the IA, which was received by SEBI on January 8, 2019, the director of the Noticees, Mr. Dharmendra Harilal Bhojak, inter alia submitted that he didn\\\\\\\\u2019t know any of the entities mentioned in the aforesaid summonses. Further, Mr. Bhojak, in his aforesaid letter, did not submit any information as sought for in the aforesaid summonses. However, the aforesaid reply was submitted by Mr Bhojak in his personal capacity and not on behalf of the Noticees. Therefore, I find that the reply of Mr. Dharmendra Harilal Bhojak is not relevant in the instant proceedings.  16. In view of the above, I conclude that the allegation that the Noticees failed to submit complete information sought for in the summonses and thus have violated the provisions of Section 11C(2) read with Section 11C(3) of the SEBI Act, stands established.   17. Any non-compliance of the summons of the Investigating Authority hampers the process of investigation. The Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (herein after referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SAT\\\\\\\\u2019) has also recognized the importance of compliance of summons and in the matter of DKG Buildcon Pvt. Ltd. v.  SEBI (Appeal No. 106 of 2006, Date of Decision: January 07, 2009), it has held that: \"...It is of utmost importance that every person from whom information is sought should fully co-operate with the investigating officer and promptly produce all documents, records, information as may be necessary for the investigations. If persons are allowed to flout the summons issued to them during the course of the investigations, the Board as the watchdog of the securities market will not be __________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 10 of 13  able to perform its duties in protecting the interests of the investors and safeguarding the integrity of the securities market.\"   18. Thus, it is well established that timely submission of information is very important for the purpose of effective investigation proceedings and non-cooperation by an entity can be detrimental to the interest of investors and the securities market on account of delay or hindrance in the investigation. The Hon'ble SAT in the Mayfair Paper & Board Pvt. Ltd. v. SEBI (Appeal No. 95 of 2004, Date of Decision: August 09, 2004) has held that failure to furnish information to the Investigating Authority of SEBI shall attract the penalty prescribed under Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act.  19. As stated above, I note that sufficient opportunities were granted to the Noticees to submit reply to the SCN and to appear for personal hearing. However, despite service of the SCN and hearing notice, none of the given opportunities were availed of by the Noticees. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Classic Credit Ltd. v. SEBI [2007] 76 SCL 51 (SAT - MUM) inter alia held that \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201cthe appellants did not file any reply to the second show-cause notice. This being so, it has to be presumed that the charges alleged against them in the show-cause notice were admitted by them\\\\\\\\u201d. The Hon'ble SAT also made such proposition in case of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Ors. v. SEBI (in appeal No. 68/2013) decided on February 11, 2014 viz. \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted charges levelled against them in the show cause notices\\\\\\\\u201d.  20. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI v. Shriram Mutual Fund [2006] 68 SCL 216(SC) has observed that \"In our considered opinion, penalty is attracted as soon as the contravention of the statutory obligation as contemplated by the Act and the Regulations is established and hence the __________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 11 of 13  intention of the parties committing such violation becomes wholly irrelevant....\". In view of the same, I find that the aforesaid violations of Section 11C(2) read with Section 11C(3) of the SEBI Act by the Noticees attract penalties under section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act.  21. The next issue for consideration is as to what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed under section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act on the Noticees for the violation of Section 11C(2) read with Section 11C(3) of the SEBI Act. The relevant text of the provisions of Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act is reproduced as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cPenalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. 15A.If   any   person, who   is   required   under   this   Act   or   any   rules   or   regulations   made thereunder, - (a) to furnish any document, return or report to the Board, fails to furnish the same, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees.\\\\\\\\u201d  22. While determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act, it is important to consider the factors as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under:  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer.  Section 15J - While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely: - (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; __________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 12 of 13  (c) the repetitive nature of the default. Explanation. \\\\\\\\u2014For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E, clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.  23. In the instant matter, it is not possible to quantify the gains made by the Noticees or the loss caused to investors as a result of the failure on the part of the Noticees to honour the summonses. I note that three (3) summonses were issued to the Noticees. Thereafter, the Noticees replied to the summonses and submitted only part information. Subsequent to that, IA served two (2) more summonses on both the Noticees seeking complete information. However, the Noticees failed to respond. Thus, I find that default of the Noticees is repetitive in nature. I also note from the Investigation Report that non-submission of information by the Noticees, hampered the investigation process and in absence of documents/ information sought from the Noticees, the exact nature of their funding to Gautam Sanjay Khandelwal and the identity of entities from whom they received the cash, could not be established and the investigation had to be concluded based on the available information/ documents. I am of the view that the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 failure to furnish required information to the Investigating Authority reflects their disregard for the investigation process of SEBI. I also observe that on account of non-co-operation by the Noticees, the investigation was hampered and therefore, this needs to be viewed seriously.    ORDER 24. Having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, the material available on record, the submissions made by the Noticees and also the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act, as enumerated above, I, in exercise __________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 13 of 13  of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, hereby impose penalties of \\\\\\\\u20b9 5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakh only) on each of the Noticees under the provisions of Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act. I am of the view that the said penalty is commensurate with the lapse/ omission on the part of the Noticees.  25. I am of the view that the said penalties are commensurate with the lapse/ omission on the part of the Noticees. The Noticees shall remit/ pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order, either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR by using the web link https://siportal.sebi.gov.in/intermediary/AOPaymentGateway.html  26. The Noticees shall forward said Demand Draft to the Enforcement Department \\\\\\\\u2013 Division of Regulatory Action\\\\\\\\u2013 IV of SEBI. The Noticees shall provide the following details while forwarding the Demand Draft:  i. Name and PAN of the entity (Noticees) ii. Name of the case / matter iii. Purpose of Payment \\\\\\\\u2013 Payment of penalty under AO proceedings iv. Bank Name and Account Number  v. Transaction Number 27.

BACKGROUND  1) Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) received several complaints against Kassa Finvest Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cKassa Finvest\\\\\\\\u201d/ \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee No. 1\\\\\\\\u201d) from its clients during the year 2014. The said complaints inter alia alleged non- receipt/delay in payment of funds and securities of clients from Kassa Finvest and also that Kassa Finvest had raised funds by way of illegally selling the securities of its clients/investors and such funds were purportedly used for meeting the operational expansion of Kassa Finvest and for the economic benefit of its group persons/ entities. Considering the serious prima facie violation of various provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2019), Securities Contracts (Regulation Act), 1956 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCRA\\\\\\\\u2019), Rules and Regulation made and various circulars issued thereunder, an investigation was ordered under Section 11C of the SEBI Act, 1992 vide order dated February 23, 2015.    2) Based on the findings of investigation, inter alia, SEBI initiated Adjudication proceedings to inquire and adjudge for alleged violations of various provisions of the SCRA\\\\\\\\u2019, SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2019, SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003, (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u2018PFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019) ,SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018PM Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019), SEBI Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Broker Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019) and circulars made thereunder against Kassa Finvest, Mr. Ashok Kumar, Director, Mr. Umashankar Sharan Srivastava, Director and  Ms. Anjana Kumar (Promoter with 51.56% shareholding),  Mr. Siddharth Shankar(son of  Mr. Ashok Kumar), Ms. Neetika Shankar (daughter-in-law of Mr. Ashok Kumar), Mr. Anil Kumar Dhawan (employee of the Broker) and Mr. Manoj Kumar Agarwal (Compliance officer of the Broker) (hereinafter individually referred   to   by   their Adjudication order in the matter of Kassa Finvest Private Limited  Page 3 of 56 respective names /notice number and collectively referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d) in the matter of  Kassa Finvest Private Limited.

Mr. Siddharth Shankar v. Ms. Neetika Shankar  The description of the above pictorial representation of the modus operandi is summarised as below:  5.1. The Noticee issued letters to clients promising fixed/ assured returns to its clients in lieu of shares and/or funds (money).   5.2. In case of shares, the rate of interest promised by the Noticee varied from 9%-13% whereas in case of funds the rate of interest promised was in the range of 18-27%.   5.3. The Noticee inter-alia mentioned in the said letters that only the Noticee will execute trades on behalf of clients and the margin money can be used for trading in any segment/ exchange.

Non segregation of own and clients' funds and securities and Mis- utilisation of clients funds/securities a) From the bank account statement analysis (refer paras 5.1, 5.2 Tables 2&3 above) it is clearly established that funds have moved from client bank Adjudication order in the matter of Kassa Finvest Private Limited  Page 16 of 56 account(s) to business bank account(s), from client bank account(s) to related entities/ persons and from business bank account(s) to related entities/persons. b) From para above, it is established that the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities had been mis-appropriated by the Noticee by pledging them and then mis-utilising the funds thereof. c) From the above para(s), it is clearly established that the Noticee has not only failed to segregate between own and clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds/ securities but has also mis-utilised the same.  5.17. Indulging in activities other that stock broking business such as providing assured returns to clients/ investors a) The admittance of running assured/ fixed return scheme was done by Mr. Anil Kumar Dhawn, Mr. Manoj Kumar Agrawal and Mr. Vivek Agrawal during their statement recording. b) In the Sample letter(s), it is mentioned that: \\\\\\\\u201cin case the profits in your account are insufficient to the tune of 27% per annum (2.25% per month), then Kassa Finvest Pvt. Ltd. will pay as loyalty bonus to the tune of minimum 2.25% per month of the capital lying with Kassa Finvest Pvt. Ltd.\\\\\\\\u201d c) \\\\\\\\u201cKassa office will execute trades on your behalf and you won\\\\\\\\u2019t execute any trade yourself (Using Odin Diet) \\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d  d) From the analysis of bank account statements (refer Para 5.4) it is clearly evident that fixed amount was being paid to certain clients.  e) Based on the above, it is clearly established that assured/fixed return scheme was being run by the Noticee. Running of such scheme(s) is fraudulent in nature by virtue of their existence and such activities are not supposed to be carried out by a stock broker/noticee no. 01. f) Moreover, the execution of trades only by the Noticee on behalf of clients is akin to running Portfolio Management Scheme (PMS). Since the Noticee did not have mandatory registration for operating PMS it was carrying out such activity in an illegitimate manner. Further, Regulation 14(3)(a) of the SEBI (Portfolio Managers Regulations, 1993) prohibits from guaranteeing or assuring any return.   5.18. Dealing in Cash: From the analysis of bank account statements cash deposits are observed in the client/ business bank accounts of Kassa.  5.19. Non-redressal of investor grievance and failure to follow the directions of the Orders of IGRP of NSE Adjudication order in the matter of Kassa Finvest Private Limited  Page 17 of 56  a) As on April 15, 2015, 421 complaints were pending against the Noticee as against 255 pending complaints against Kassa (as per SCORES) as on March 11, 2015. b) From the above fact it is evident that the Noticee failed to redress investor complaints despite repeated reminders and directions within the stipulated time frame, thus violating the conditions of registration.  5.20. Non-compliance of the requirement of periodical settlement of client accounts and failure to return securities on clients\\\\\\\\u2019 request  a) The Noticee is required to ensure periodical settlement of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds/ securities on a monthly/ quarterly basis. b) From the sample complaints perused, it has been observed that the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities/funds have not been settled by the Noticee.  5.21. Failure to furnish information:  a) Mr. Ashok Kumar failed to furnish complete information/ details pertaining to financial ledgers, demat accounts/statements, details of bank accounts/ statements, etc. as sought from him vide summons dated March 3, 5 and 16, 2015. Further, Mr. Ashok Kumar also failed to furnish details pertaining to assets/ investments/ property held in his/ the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name since it was found during the course of investigation that securities/ mutual fund units other than those declared by Mr. Ashok Kumar were held by the Noticee.  b) Ms. Anjana Kumar failed to furnish PAN details an", "Date": "2021-02-24", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Adjudication Order in respect of 8 entities in the matter of Kassa Finvest Pvt.

In respect of Investeria Financial Services Pvt Ltd PAN: AAFCP8423Q          In the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited ___________________________________________________________________ FACTS OF THE CASE 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) conducted an investigation into the affairs of Supreme Tex Mart Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018STML/Company\\\\\\\\u2019) for the period, June 01, 2016 to October 31, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Investigation Period/ IP\\\\\\\\u2019).

During the investigation, SEBI observed that Santosh was not traceable. Thereafter, SEBI requested the Noticee to provide basic order placement details of Santosh. However, it was alleged that the Noticee failed to keep basic order placement details of Santosh. Thus, it was alleged that the Noticee failed to exercise due skill and care and thereby violated the provisions of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2019) and Clause A(2) of the Code of conduct for Stock Brokers as stipulated in schedule II read with Regulation 9 of the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub brokers) _________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 2 of 8  Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBroker Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). In view of the same, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act against the Noticee.  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 2. Shri B. J. Dilip was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018AO\\\\\\\\u2019) vide order dated March 28, 2019, under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act and Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018AO Rules\\\\\\\\u2019), to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions of Section 15HB of the SEBI Act, the alleged violations of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with Clause A(2) of Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified in Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of Brokers Regulations by the Noticee, in the scrip of STML. Pursuant to the transfer of Shri B. J. Dilip to another department of the SEBI, the undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter by SEBI vide Communique dated December 31, 2020.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 3. Show Cause Notice dated October 16, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee under the provisions of Rule 4(1) of the AO Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against the Noticee and why penalty, if any, should not be imposed on the Noticee under the provisions of Section 15HB of the SEBI Act for the alleged violations of the Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with Clause A(2) of Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified in Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of Brokers Regulations, committed by him.   4. The following allegations were levelled against the Noticee in the SCN:  a) The Noticee, which w the stock broker of one Mr. Santosh Gajendra Singh (herein after referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Santosh\\\\\\\\u2019), vide its email dated August 14, 2018, provided the KYC _________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 3 of 8  document including account opening form of Santosh. From the KYC documents, it was observed that Santosh was introduced to the Noticee by Ms. Madhu Lahoti, wife of Mr. Neeleshkumar Lahoti. It was also observed that the mobile number (9867996996) provided as the contact number of Ms. Madhu Lahoti belongs to Mr. Neeleshkumar Lahoti.  b) The mobile number provided as contact number of Santosh is 9920053814. On dialling this number, it was observed that the number is constantly on engaged tone. Further, on searching the mobile number on internet, it was observed that this number is the contact number of Nityanand Bar and Restaurant in Borivali East, Mumbai.  c) Summons under section 11C(2) and 11C(5) of SEBI Act, 1992, were issued to Mr. Santosh Gajander Singh on August 21, 2018 and August 28, 2018 for personal appearance before Investigating Authority, however, both the summons returned undelivered. Further, it was also gathered on visiting the address of Santosh as available in his KYC that no person by the name of Mr. Santosh Gajander Singh resides there and presently coaching classes were operating at that address. Therefore, Mr. Santosh Gajander Singh is not traceable. Further, vide email dated September 26, 2018, the Noticee was asked to provide the phone number through which Santosh used to place the order for trading and provide the transcript of the call records. Vide email dated September 27, 2018, the Noticee replied that Santosh used to call on the mobile number of the dealer and they do not have any transcripts of the call records.  d) Trading being the general business for any broking entity, basic order placement details, viz., name of the person placing the order, telephone number used for order placement from which the order placed, etc. should be readily available with the broking entity. Unavailability of basic details relevant to order placement without providing any appropriate reasons shows that the Noticee has failed in exercising due skill, care and diligence in the conduct of its business. Therefore, it is alleged that the Noticee had violated the provisions of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Clause A (2) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified under Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of Brokers Regulations. e) The  aforesaid  alleged  violations,  if  established,  make  the  Noticee  liable  for monetary penalty under Section 15HB of SEBI Act. _________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 4 of 8   5.

Registration of Authorised person had been cancelled in year 2017 in both the Exchanges. Further we would like to mention that Mrs. Madhu Neeleshkumar Lahoti joined the organisation as employee on 01st March 2017 and later she appointed as Director of Investeria Financial Services Private Limited w.e.f. 17 December 2018. c) Further we would like to state that, Mr. Santosh Gajendra Singh had opened his account on 10 December, 2011, with us.

In the interest of natural justice, vide digitally signed email dated November 24, 2020, the Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing in the matter before the erstwhile AO on December 15, 2020. The Authorised Representative (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018AR\\\\\\\\u2019) of the Noticee attended the hearing as per schedule. Thereafter, the matter was transferred to the undersigned.

The aforesaid hearing notice was sent through email dated January 20, 2021 and was duly served upon the Noticee. Vide email dated January 22, 2021, the AR of the Noticee requested the undersigned to pass the order on the basis of their submissions on record.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS  7. I have carefully perused the written submissions of the Noticee and documents/ evidence available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are:  Issue I:  Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Clause A(2) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified under Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of Brokers Regulations? Issue II:  Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act?  Issue III:  If yes, what should be the quantum of penalty?   Issue I: Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Clause A(2) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified under Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of Brokers Regulations?  8. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions, which are reproduced hereunder:  SEBI Act Section 12 (1) of SEBI Act  No stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities _________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 6 of 8  market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the [regulations] made under this Act:   Provided that a person buying or selling securities or otherwise dealing with the securities market as a stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market immediately before the establishment of the Board for which no registration certificate was necessary prior to such establishment, may continue to do so for a period of three months from such establishment or, if he has made an application for such registration within the said period of three months, till the disposal of such application:   Clause A(2) of Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers specified in Schedule II and Regulation 9 of the Brokers Regulations  Clause A(2) - A stock-broker shall act with due skill, care and diligence in the conduct of all his business.  Regulation 9 \\\\\\\\u2013 Any registration granted by the Board under Regulation 6, he shall at all times abide by the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II.   9. The first issue for consideration is whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Clause A(2) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified under Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of Brokers Regulations. The principal allegation in the SCN against the Noticee is that it has not kept basic details like name of the person placing the order, contact number of client through which he used to place the order for trading as well as transcript of the call records of trading by the client, during the investigation period. In this regard, I note from email of the Noticee dated September 27, 2018, wherein the Noticee submitted that Santosh used to place order with the dealers. Further, I find that the mobile number of Santosh, provided by the Noticee to the Investigating Authority of SEBI (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018IA\\\\\\\\u2019) vide email dated August 14, 2018, was 9920053814. However, it was observed by the IA that impugned contact number was inactive. I note from the available records that the contact number of Santosh, as mentioned in the account opening form is 9920053814, which is the same contact number that the Noticee had provided to the IA during investigation. In _________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 7 of 8  this regard, the Noticee has submitted that Santosh had opened his account on December 10, 2011 and during the tenure of being its client, Santosh had never requested to change his contact number. Further, there is nothing available on record to show that the impugned contact number was not active during the Investigation Period (June 01, 2016 to October 31, 2016), and also nothing has been placed on record to suggest that Santosh used any other contact number to place orders with the dealers of the Noticee. In view of the same, it is difficult to conclude that the contact number of Santosh (9920053814), was not used by Santosh for placing orders through the Noticee, even though the IA found the said contact number to be inactive at the time of investigation. 10. It is also alleged in the SCN that the Noticee has failed to keep transcript of the call records of trading by Santosh during the investigation period. In this regard I note that SEBI, vide circular dated September 26, 2017, has made it mandatory for all the brokers to execute trades of clients only after keeping evidence of the client placing such order in the forms mentioned in the aforesaid circular including Telephone Recording. I observe that the aforesaid circular has come into effect from January 01, 2018. Thus, I find that during the investigation period it was not mandatory for the Noticee to keep the transcript of the call records of trading by Santosh.  11. Further, it is also mentioned in the SCN that the IA issued two (2) summonses dated August 21 & 28, 2018, to Santosh for personal appearance before him. However, both the summonses returned undelivered. On visiting the address of Santosh as available in his KYC, it was found that no person by the name of Mr. Santosh Gajander Singh resided there. In this regard, I find from the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s submissions that at the time of account opening, it had obtained all the necessary details of Mr. Santosh Gajendra Singh. On perusal of documents available on record, I note from the account opening form dated December 07, 2011, of Santosh, filed with the Noticee that Santosh had furnished a copy of his Driving Licence. From the account opening form of Santosh as part of his Know Your Client documentation, I note that the address mentioned therein is 71/703, _________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Supreme Tex Mart Limited                                        Page 8 of 8  Surya Darshan CHS Ltd., Opp. Profit Centre, Kandivli (W), Mumbai \\\\\\\\u2013 400067 which is same as that mentioned on the copy of Driving Licence that Santosh had submitted along with the account opening form. I also observe that the account opening form of Santosh is signed and dated December 07, 2011, which is 7 years prior to the date of summonses. The Noticee has also submitted that Santosh never requested or applied for change in his address when he was the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s client. Thus, I find that the Noticee has obtained supporting documents along with account opening form from Santosh and the same has been duly provided to the IA.  12. In view of the foregoing, I find that allegation against the Noticee, that it has failed to keep the basic order placement details of the orders placed by the Santosh and thereby violated the provisions of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Clause A(2) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified under Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of Brokers Regulations, do not stand established. ORDER 13. In view of my findings noted in the preceding paragraphs and in exercise of powers conferred upon me under Section 15I of SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee viz. Investeria Financial Services Privet Limited vide SCN dated October 16, 2020, without imposition of any monetary penalty. 14. Copies of this Adjudication Order are being sent to the Noticee and also to SEBI in terms of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules.
