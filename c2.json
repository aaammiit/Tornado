Ltd.  1 WTM/GM/EFD/DRA3/12523/2021-22  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA  ORDER  In respect of SEBI Order dated June 16, 2015, and Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal Order dated November 07, 2017, in the matter of Capacious Farming Pvt. Ltd. In respect of: SL NO.  NOTICEE PAN 1.  Capacious Farming Pvt. Ltd. AAECC3138N 2.  Gaurav Yadav ACQPY5145E 3.  Gurbaksh Singh BCLPS1117G 4.  Narmin Kaur Yadav ---  BACKGROUND 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had passed an order dated June 16, 2015, against Capacious Farming Pvt. Ltd. (Capacious/Company) and its directors - Gaurav Yadav,  Gurbaksh Singh and Narmin Kaur Yadav (collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019), holding that the Company had a launched a \\\\\\\\u2018Collective Investment Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019 without obtaining a certificate of registration from SEBI, and had thereby contravened the provisions of Section 12(1B) of the SEBI Act read with Regulation 3 of the SEBI (Collective Investment Scheme) Regulations, 1999 (CIS Regulations). The Noticees were restrained from collecting money from the investors and also directed to wind up the existing Schemes and refund the money collected. 2. The Noticees preferred an appeal (Appeal No. 405 of 2015) against the said order before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). The Noticees primarily contended before the Tribunal that SEBI had passed the Order without granting an opportunity to the Noticees to furnish relevant documents. SAT vide order dated November 07, 2017, set_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Capacious Farming Pvt. Ltd.  2 aside the order passed by SEBI; directed the Noticees to file their submissions before SEBI within four weeks from the date of the SAT order; and directed SEBI to pass a fresh order taking into consideration the fresh submissions made by the Noticees. The Noticees in compliance with the SAT order filed their submissions before SEBI vide letter dated November 11, 2017.  3. In view of the above, I note that the scope of the present proceedings would be limited to examining the findings made by SEBI in the order dated June 16, 2015, in light of the submissions made by the Noticee vide letter dated November 11, 2017. Therefore, before moving forward, I think it would be appropriate to reproduce the main findings in the SEBI Order dated June 16, 2015, against the Noticees: \\\\\\\\u201cLet me now, proceed to test the characteristics of the impugned schemes/ plans floated and carried on by the Company against the four conditions under Section 11AA(2) of the SEBI Act. i. The first condition is that the contributions, or payments made by the investors, by whatever name called, are pooled and utilized for the purposes of the scheme or arrangement. Capacious accepts funds from the public for its schemes towards the sale/ upbringing of goats/ pigs. The customers/ investors of Capacious willing to subscribe to the schemes get the option of payment i.e. part payment or one time. The 'sale agreement' states that \"the SELLER has already purchased/ made arrangements for purchasing/ procuring the .... goat(s) for its PURCHASER\", 'the arrangement for purchasing' points towards the pooling of resources. Further, the 'scheme brochure' states that \"...can purchase live stock (Goats/Pigs) from Capacious Farming Pvt. Ltd. at part payment option instead of one time advance payment plan and you can do an agreement for rearing of your already purchased animal and can get following benefits ...\". The same hints that the objective for a customer would be to subscribe to one of the plans offered by the Company for the purchase of goat/ pig. Further, the_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Capacious Farming Pvt. Ltd.  3 'sale agreement' as provided by Capacious, does not specify the details of the breed of the goat/ pig sold to the customer in order to identify the animal. The Company despite its assertion that all sales were made on outright basis, failed to give any evidence of sale. It even failed to give names of its customers. In the light of the above and also the provisions in the sale agreement, it can be concluded that the 'contributions, or payments made by the investors, are pooled and utilised by Capacious  for the purposes of the scheme or arrangement', the scheme being sale of goat/ pig. Thus, satisfying the first condition as stipulated in Section 11AA(2)(i) of the SEBI Act. ii. The second condition is that the contributions or payments are made to such scheme or arrangement by the investors with a view to receive profits, income, produce or property, whether movable or immovable from such scheme or arrangement. As discussed above, in Table A and B the 'scheme brochure' provides for the estimated cost of the developed animal after 48 months and 72 months in the case of part payment option and cost of the animal after 4 years in one time payment option. From the same, it can be said that the same assures the customers/ investors of 'the expected cost' which means nothing but profits. Further, the scheme brochure also stated that \"On quarterly advance instalment you will get 2% extra benefit on end of agreement. On half yearly advance instalment you will get 5% extra benefit on end of agreement. On yearly advance instalment you will get 10% extra benefit on end of agreement\" indicating another element of return. This makes it clear that the customers/ purchaser had made the contribution/ payment with a view to receive the profits/ income/property/ return on their initial investments that may accrue to them as applicable, thus attracting the second condition as stipulated in Section 11AA(2)(ii) of the SEBI Act. iii. The third condition is that the property, contribution or investment forming part of scheme or arrangement, whether identifiable or not, is managed on behalf of the investors. The fourth condition is that the investors do not have day to day control over the management and operation of the scheme_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Capacious Farming Pvt. Ltd.  4 or arrangement. In this regard, I note the relevant clauses from the 'scheme brochure' i.e. \"...you can do an agreement for rearing of your already purchased animal'. The same points that Capacious was engaged in the rearing of the animals, which had been sold to the customers. In view of the same, it can be said that the customer/ investor does not take part in the acquisition or rearing of the animal. Further, it can also be concluded that the goats/ pigs pertaining to the plan/ scheme were managed by the Company and the customers do not have day to day control over the scheme.  As all the four conditions specified under section 11AA(2) of the SEBI Act are satisfied in this case, the schemes/ plans promoted, launched, carried on and operated by the Company are in the nature of CIS in terms of section 11AA(1).\\\\\\\\u201d 4. It can be noted from the above, that SEBI vide the said order had held that the Noticees were running a \\\\\\\\u201ccollective investment scheme\\\\\\\\u201d (CIS) related to the rearing of pigs and goats wherein investors could make part or one-time payments and make returns on their investments in the range of 2% quarterly to 10% per annum. The modus operandi of the Company in a nutshell, as per the SEBI order, involved running a scheme wherein investors could make payments \\\\\\\\u2013 onetime or in instalments \\\\\\\\u2013 towards the purchase of pigs or goats. The Company would rear the animals and the investors would get returns based on the purported increase in value of the reared livestock.  5. The Noticees in their reply, on the other hand, claimed that the company was running a dairy farm and was in the business of selling livestock and related products. It was claimed that customers took possession of the livestock at the time of the sale itself and the Company was not in any way involved in the rearing of the livestock post the sale. It was submitted that initially the company was executing agreements for every sale but the practice was discontinued as the clientele of the company was predominantly rural and the customers were reluctant to enter into such agreements for the purchase of livestock. It_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Capacious Farming Pvt. Ltd.  5 was also submitted that even though the company had initially contemplated the sale of livestock on payments made in instalments, the scheme was never launched as there were no takers for the same. The Company also reiterated its submission that there was no question of returning funds to any clients/investors as the Company had never solicited any investments and had only engaged in outright sale of livestock and related products. Further, the instalment scheme which was initially envisaged was also not operationalised and therefore the question of refunds did not arise in this respect also. In support of the contentions made in the reply, the Capacious submitted the following documents: a. Copy of seven sale agreements entered with clients. b. Copy of the sales ledger account of the company for the financial years 2011-12, 2012-13, 2013-14. It was submitted by the Company that it did not maintain any separate account of sales return and the sales return and discounts offered are reflected in the sales ledger account.  6. Pursuant to the reply submitted by the Noticees, the matter was placed before me for consideration on October 22, 2020, upon which the Noticees were granted an opportunity of personal hearing initially on February 14, 2021, which was later postponed to April 22, 2021, due to certain official exigencies. Vide email dated April 22, 2021, Noticee No. 2, however, sought an adjournment of the hearing on grounds that his legal representative had contracted COVID. The said request was accepted and date of hearing was postponed to May 18, 2021. On the said date, Mr. Summet Singh Dhir, Chartered Accountant, appeared on behalf of Noticee No. 1, Noticee No. 2 and Noticee No. 4. No appearance was entered on behalf of Noticee No. 3. 7. Pursuant to the personal hearing, the authorised representative made written submissions vide email dated June 09, 2021. Submissions made during the oral hearing and in writing_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Capacious Farming Pvt. Ltd.  6 were on the same lines as the earlier submissions made by the Noticees, which have been captured in paragraph 5 of this order.  8. I have considered the SEBI Order dated June 16, 2015, the written and oral submissions made on behalf of the Noticees and other material available on record. I note that the only issue that arises for consideration is whether the Noticees have submitted sufficient documents and records to rebut the finding in the SEBI order that the Company was running a CIS, and to support the claim of the Noticees that the Company was engaged in outright sale of livestock and related products.  9. I would, therefore, proceed to examine the documents submitted by the Noticees. As stated in earlier paragraphs, it is the contention of the Company that it was engaged in outright sale of livestock and related products. In support of this claim, the Company has submitted a copy of seven lease agreements entered into with clients. I further note that as per the submission of the Company, agreements were entered into with only a few initial clients and this practice was discontinued later. It is also noted that the copy of these agreements was available on record at the time of passing the earlier SEBI order and the arguments made by the Company taking support of the sale agreements have already been addressed in the said order. In view of the same, I do not find any merit in revisiting the findings in the earlier SEBI order on the basis of the agreements submitted by the Noticee.  10. Now I move on to examine the other set of documents submitted by the Noticees - Copy of the sales ledger account of the company for the financial years 2011-12, 2012-13, 2013-14. Before I proceed with the examination, I consider it appropriate to reproduce a portion of the sales ledger account to put in context the nature of the information contained therein._______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Capacious Farming Pvt. Ltd.  7 Capacious Farming 01.04.2011 to 31.03.2012 #9144, Bikker Singh Ahluwalia Complex Mini Secretariat Road Bathinda  Live Stock Sales  Ledger Account  01-Apr-2011 to 31-Mar-2012 Date Particulars Vch Type Vch No. Debit Credit 04-04-2011 Dr Cash Sales 1  6000.00 04-04-2011 Dr Cash Sales 2  6100.00 06-04-2011 Dr Cash Sales 3  6200.00 06-04-2011 Dr Cash Sales 4  6200.00 06-04-2011 Dr Cash Sales 5  6100.00    11. As can be noted from the table above, the ledger statement contains certain figures under the head \\\\\\\\u2018Credit\\\\\\\\u2019 corresponding to a particular voucher number. The only other information that is available is the date and that the transaction was in cash. Even basic information like the name and address of the customer is not available. Further, the amounts recorded in the ledger statement does not correspond to the amounts mentioned in the complaint on the basis of which the proceedings against the Noticee was initiated. I note from the records that other than submitting that the compliant is motivated and filed on behalf of business rivals, the Noticee has not addressed any of the allegations contained therein. I note that the Complainant had annexed copies of the receipts given by the Company and the cheques through which payments were made. However, the Company has failed to provide any explanation or rebut the allegations raised therein in any meaningful manner.  12. I further note from the records that subsequent to the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal remanding the matter back to SEBI, another complaint was received against the Company vide email dated June 17, 2021. The Complainant had enclosed copies_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Capacious Farming Pvt. Ltd.  8 of receipts given by the company and the cheques through which payments were made. The complainant had alleged that he had invested an amount of Rs. 13,25,000 in the Company in 2013.  13. After considering the documents submitted by the company, I am of the view that if the company was only engaged in outright sale of livestock and related products, as claimed, then there would have been no occasion for entering into detailed agreements for the same with customers. The very existence of these agreements leads to a presumption that the entity was not engaged in sale of livestock and related products. It is further noted that SEBI had received investor complaints alleging that the Company had not paid back money they had invested. It is noted that the complainants had enclosed copies of the receipts given by the Company acknowledging the payments received from them. The complainants had also submitted copies of the cheques through which payments were made. Further, the amounts mentioned in the complaints and the receipts issued by the Company do not match with the sales ledger or other documents submitted by the Company.   14. In view of the above, I am of the opinion that the details furnished in the form of the sales ledger account and copies of agreements entered into with customers are not sufficient to come to a conclusion that the Company was engaged in the outright sale of livestock and related products as opposed to running a CIS scheme as held in the SEBI Order. I am therefore inclined to ratify the findings in the SEBI order dated June 16, 2015. Order 15. In view of the above, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 19 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 read with Sections 11(1), 11(4) and_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Capacious Farming Pvt.

Limited are wound up and all the monies mobilized through such schemes are refunded to its investors with returns which are due to them.  b.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) received a complaint, alleging violations of Securities Laws, in the scrip of Halonix Limited (Now known as \\\\\\\\u2018Phoenix Lamps Limited\\\\\\\\u2019) (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Halonix/ Company\\\\\\\\u2019) and conducted investigation in the matter for the period February 26, 2010 to September 24, 2010 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Investigation Period/IP\\\\\\\\u2019). The focus of investigation was to examine whether there were any violations in the provisions of, inter alia, SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018PFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019) during the investigation period.   2. The shares of Halonix are listed on BSE Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018BSE\\\\\\\\u2019) and National Stock Exchange (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018NSE\\\\\\\\u2019).

During the investigation, SEBI observed that the average traded volume in the scrip was comparatively high during the investigation period. It was further observed that certain entities including Nikon Finlease Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNikon/client\\\\\\\\u201d) entered into self-trades on multiple days, during the investigation period. It was further observed that Vineet Securities Private Limited (hereinafter to as \\\\\\\\u2018Vineet/ Noticee/ by Name\\\\\\\\u2019) was the broker on buy side as well as on the sell side on all the occasions of self-trades executed by Nikon. It was, therefore, alleged that by acting as broker and counterparty broker for self-trades of Nikon, Noticee failed to exercise due skill and care and thereby violated Clause A (2) of the Code of conduct for Stock Brokers as stipulated in schedule II read with Regulation 7 of the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub brokers) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBroker Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d)._____________________________________________________________________________________ In the matter of Halonix Limited                                                                                                            Page 3 of 8   APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER   4. SEBI, vide order dated January 19, 2021 appointed the undersigned as Adjudicating Officer under Section 15I of the SEBI Act, read with Rule 3 of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) to inquire into and adjudge under Section 15HB of SEBI Act, the alleged violation of the provisions of Clause A(2) of the Code of conduct for Stock Brokers as stipulated in schedule II read with Regulation 7 of the Broker Regulations, 1992 by Noticee.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING   5. A show-cause notice no. SEBI/EAD/SM/MKG/2395/1/2021 dated January 29, 2021 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to Noticee under Rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules to show-cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against Noticee and penalty, if any, not be imposed upon them under the provisions of Section 15HB of SEBI Act for the aforesaid violations alleged to have been committed by them.  6. It was alleged in the SCN that there were some entities who had entered into a major number of self-trades on BSE. It was also observed that both the buy and the sell side brokers, including Noticee, were same for these entities. The details of self-trade entered into by the client of Noticee viz. Nikon are as under \\\\\\\\u2013  Table - 2: Self-Trades:  Broker On Both Buy & Sell Side Entity Name Total Self Trade Volume Total Self Trade Count No of days on which self-trades done Vineet Securities Private Limited Nikon Finlease Private Limited 2321 136 6_____________________________________________________________________________________ In the matter of Halonix Limited                                                                                                            Page 4 of 8   7. It is observed from the table that Noticee was broker of Nikon on both the buy and the sell side. In view of the same it is alleged that the entity, Nikon, by entering into self-trades, had traded in a fraudulent manner without having the intention to transfer beneficial ownership of shares. Therefore, it is also alleged that Noticee, as a broker of Nikon, had failed to exercise due skill and care, while restricting the Self-trades entered into by its client on multiple instances.  8. In light of the above, it is alleged that Noticee has violated the provisions of Clause A (2) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified in Schedule II read with Regulation 7 of the Broker Regulations.   9. The SCN was sent to Noticee via Speed Post Acknowledgement Due (\\\\\\\\u2018SPAD\\\\\\\\u2019) as well as through email.  However, I note that SCN issued to Noticee through email was duly served to Noticee.  Noticee was given fifteen days (15) time to make its submission or file its reply in respect of the allegations made in the SCN.  Noticee failed to file any reply to SCN. Subsequently, in the interest of natural justice, through digitally signed email dated June 30, 2021, Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing on July 07, 2021 and was duly served on Noticee.  Vide the said email, Noticee was advised to submit their reply on or before the date of hearing. However, Noticee did not appear for the hearing and did not seek any further date of hearing.  Noticee also failed to submit the reply to SCN.    10. I note that despite service  of  the  SCN  and  hearing  notices,  none  of  the  given  opportunities  were availed of by Noticee. In this regard, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Ors.  v. SEBI (in appeal No.  68/2013)  decided  on  February  11, 2014, held that \\\\\\\\u201c...appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them  nor  availed  opportunity  of  personal  hearing  offered  to  them  in  the adjudication  proceedings  and,  therefore,  appellants  are  presumed  to have admitted charges levelled against them in the show cause notices\\\\\\\\u201d._____________________________________________________________________________________ In the matter of Halonix Limited                                                                                                            Page 5 of 8   11. In view of the above, I am compelled to proceed ex parte in the matter against Noticee. I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been complied with since sufficient opportunities have been provided to Noticee to submit their replies and to appear for personal hearing. I, therefore, am of the view that Noticee have nothing to submit and in terms of rule 4(7) of the Adjudication Rules, the matter can be proceeded ex-parte on the basis of material available on record. Therefore, the present proceedings against Noticee are undertaken ex-parte on the basis of available documents and information.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES   12. I have carefully perused the charges levelled against Noticee and other documents/ evidence available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are:  (a) Whether Noticee has violated the Clause A(2) of the Code of conduct for Stock Brokers as stipulated in schedule II read with Regulation 7 of the Broker Regulations, 1992 ?  (b) If yes, then do the violations, if any, on the part of Noticee attract any monetary penalty under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act.?  (c) If yes, then what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon Noticee, taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act.?  13. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of the Clause A (2) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified in Schedule II read with Regulation 7 of Broker Regulations which read as under:-_____________________________________________________________________________________ In the matter of Halonix Limited                                                                                                            Page 6 of 8   Provisions of the Clause A (2) of the Code of Conduct:  Exercise of due skill and care: A stock-broker shall act with due skill, care and diligence in the conduct of all his business.  Regulation 7 of Broker Regulations:  The stock broker holding a certificate shall at all times abide by the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II.  14. The first issue to be decided is whether Noticee has violated Clause A (2) of the Code of conduct for Stock Brokers as stipulated in Schedule II read with Regulation 7 of the Broker Regulations, 1992?  15. Upon perusal of the documents available on record, I find that 136 self-trades for a total quantity of 2321 shares were executed by Nikon in the scrip of Halonix at BSE on six(6) days during the investigation period. I note that the only charge against Noticee is that it acted as a broker and counterparty broker for the self-trades of Nikon.     16. I find that on BSE, the total traded volume of Halonix shares during the investigation period was 46,21,498 shares and self-trades executed by Nikon in the scrip of Halonix was for a total quantity of 2321 shares through 136 trades. I also note that the percentage of self-trade volume executed by Nikon to the total traded market volume on BSE was only 0.05022%. Similarly, I also find that on NSE the total traded volume of Halonix shares during the investigation period was 70,15,459 shares and Nikon has not allegedly executed any self-trades on behalf of its client in the scrip of Halonix on NSE during the investigation period. Therefore, I note that total volume of self-trades executed by the Nikon was only 0.0199% of total market volume, i.e. on both the BSE and NSE, during the investigation period._____________________________________________________________________________________ In the matter of Halonix Limited                                                                                                            Page 7 of 8   17. I note that the trading transactions of Nikon which gave rise to the present proceedings against Noticee have elaborately been dealt with vide order dated May 31, 2021 in a separate proceedings before me against Nikon wherein I noted, inter alia, as under:   \\\\\\\\u201cI also note that on all trading days when the Noticee has executed self-trades, the percentage of volume of self-trades to total market volume traded on NSE and BSE, is miniscule as it is less than 0.1% of total market volume on five (5)days out of six days. In view of the same, I find that the percentage contribution in the volume, as mentioned above, does not suggest the possibility of any manipulative intent on the part of the Noticee to the extent of contributing to market volume through artificial volume creation in the scrip of Halonix during the investigation period\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.  Therefore,  I  find  that only few instances of self-trades,  as  presented  in  the  instant  matter cannot be considered to be fraudulent in nature, unless supporting facts and circumstances leading  to  a  manipulative  intent behind  these  trades  are  also presented.  I note that Investigation report is silent on these facts and circumstances, which would be necessary to establish that these Self-trades executed by the Noticee were manipulative trades, intended to defraud the market.   On  account  of  aforesaid observations, I find  it  difficult  to  conclude that the  aforesaid self-trades by the Noticee in the scrip of Halonix were in violation of provisions of Sections 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act read with Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (g) of PFUTP Regulations. Since, the alleged violations are not established against the Noticee, issues No. (b) and (c)require no consideration\\\\\\\\u201d  18. In view of the above observation, since it is not established that Nikon had entered into self-trades to create artificial volume in the scrip, there is no case to draw any adverse inference on Noticee as the broker and counterparty broker of Nikon, as_____________________________________________________________________________________ In the matter of Halonix Limited                                                                                                            Page 8 of 8   regards the allegation of violation of Clause A(2) of the Code of Conduct as stipulated under Schedule II read with Regulation 7 of Broker Regulations, 1992.   19. As the alleged violations are not established against Noticee, Issue No. (b) and (c) as mentioned in paragraph no. 12 require no consideration.   ORDER  20. Accordingly, taking into account the aforesaid findings, the Adjudication proceedings against Noticee i.e. Vineet Securities Private Limited, initiated vide Show Cause Notice dated January 29, 2021, stands disposed of without imposition of any penalty.   21. In terms of rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, copies of this order are sent to Noticee and also to SEBI.

B. Industries Limited    Page 3 of 55     3. SCN-II and SCN-III, call upon Noticee no. 8 and 9, respectively, to show cause as to why suitable directions, as deemed fit under Section 11, 11B and 11D of SEBI Act, 1992, should not be issued against them for violation of Regulation 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 4(1), 4(2)(a), 4(2)(e), 4(2)(f) and 4(2)(r) of PFUTP Regulation, 2003, as auditors of Noticee no. 1.   4. The brief facts of the case and the allegations levelled against the Noticees, as mentioned in the SCN are as follows:   4.1. SEBI passed an interim order on November 09, 2017, inter-alia, permitting the promoters and the directors (Noticee no. 2 to 6) of VBIL to only buy the securities of VBIL and restraining them from selling any of securities held by them. Further, vide the said interim order, the stock exchange were directed to appoint an independent forensic auditor to, inter-alia, further verify:  4.1.1. Misrepresentation including of financials and/or business of VBIL if any;  4.1.2. Misuse of the funds/books of accounts of VBIL, if any.    4.2. The forensic audit report was submitted to SEBI by the stock exchange and the findings of the forensic audit report from the period April 01, 2015 till March 31, 2018 were examined.   4.3. The investigation, inter-alia, revealed the following:   I. Misrepresentation including of financials and misuse of funds/ books of accounts: 4.3.1. Misreporting in Cash Flow Statements:  4.3.1.1. The Company is engaged in the business of providing financing activities, trading /investment in shares and securities and providingFinal Order in the matter of V. B. Industries Limited    Page 4 of 55   financial assistance to individuals and corporates. Therefore, interest income from such activities should be shown under the head \\\\\\\\u201cCash flow from operating activities\\\\\\\\u201d rather than \\\\\\\\u201cCash flow from financing activities\\\\\\\\u201d. However, it is noted that for three consecutive financial years beginning since 2015-16, VBIL has incorrectly shown interest received by it on loans and advances granted by it under the head \\\\\\\\u201cCash flow from financing activities\\\\\\\\u201d instead of \\\\\\\\u201cCash flow from operating activities\\\\\\\\u201d as under:   FY 2015-16: Rs 111.68 lakhs FY 2016-17: Rs 43.56 lakhs FY 2017-18: Rs 44.67 lakhs  4.3.1.2. The Company has shown incorrect figures of net increase in total current liabilities, in the cash flow statement, by including provision for taxation and provision for expenses in total current liabilities, despite these items being non cash in nature. The amount for the same is as under:                                           FY 2015-16: Rs 3,439.54 lakhs                               FY 2016-17: Rs 2,906.69 lakhs                               FY 2017-18: Rs 283.37 lakhs  4.3.1.3. VBIL has shown current year tax paid as an outflow under operating activities in cash flow statement and same amount as a provision for taxation in balance sheet under the head short term provisions in current liabilities. These amounts are as under:  FY 2015-16: Rs 13.68 lakhs                                       FY 2016-17: Rs 2.68 lakhs                                       FY 2017-18: Rs 4.02 lakhs  Thus, the SCN alleges that the Company has not prepared its cash flow statement in accordance with AS-3.  The aforesaid incorrect accounting treatment allegedly carried out by VBIL has led to misrepresentation of books of accounts/misuse of funds.Final Order in the matter of V. B. Industries Limited    Page 5 of 55    4.3.2. There is minimal movement in opening & closing balances of debtors/ receivables and creditors/ payables in the financial statements of VBIL, thereby indicating that the Company is unable to realise cash from its receivables, which adversely affects the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s working capital cycle.  4.3.3. Advancement of huge amount of unsecured loans by VBIL at minimal rate of interest (0.59%-1.46%) and that too without any provisioning is not a prudent business practice as transactions entered into by the Company gives an impression that the Company has not judiciously utilised the shareholder\\\\\\\\u2019s funds, thereby leading to misuse of the funds of the Company.   4.3.4. VBIL has invested in the shares of companies which seem to have no legitimate business activity, are either loss making or have been delisted from the stock exchange or are having nil inventory. These transactions indicate that VBIL has not taken due care in selecting companies for making investments, thereby leading to misrepresentation of its books/ misuse of shareholder\\\\\\\\u2019s funds.  4.3.5. VBIL has transferred funds to different parties, either on the same date of receipt of funds or within a gap of one day, which raises concern about the genuineness of business transactions undertaken by the Company. Further, failure on part of the Company to furnish information or any evidence, to justify such receipt and transfer of funds, to the forensic auditor, indicates that VBIL is making accommodation entries. Therefore, VBIL has led to misrepresentation of books of accounts/misuse of funds as apparently no underlying business transactions have taken place.   4.3.6. The revenue of the Company has substantially reduced from Rs 14,501 lakhs to Rs 573.17 lakhs from FY 2015-16 to FY 2017-18. However, other expensesFinal Order in the matter of V. B. Industries Limited    Page 6 of 55   of the Company have increased from Rs 15.79 lakhs to Rs 16.05 lakhs from FY 2015-16 to FY 2017-18.  Also, employee benefit expenses of the Company have also increased from Rs 13.51 lakhs to Rs 14.61 lakhs from FY 2015-16 to FY 2017-18. In a scenario, where revenue of the Company has declined in three consecutive financial years; the employee benefit expense of the Company should have also reduced but instead the said expense has increased, without justifying the fall in revenues.  4.3.7. The observations of the forensic auditor that the Company was operating from a small room having only two computer systems raises doubts over the operations of the Company.    II. Non-furnishing of information to the forensic auditor:  4.3.8. The SCN alleges that the Company has not furnished the information sought by the forensic auditor in various instances viz. Company has not furnished any information/explanation with respect to the queries raised by SEBI in the interim order and confirmatory order, Company has not provided any data/information like debtors\\\\\\\\u2019/creditors\\\\\\\\u2019 ageing, list of debtors & creditors along with their balances and other supporting documents with respect to sales & purchases, bank books of the Company in excel format and bank account statements for all the bank accounts of the Company in soft copy format (excel or text format).  III. Violation of LODR Regulations:  4.3.9. VBIL failed to submit quarterly result to stock exchange, within the stipulated period of 45 days from the end of each quarter, in three instances, which is in violation of Regulation 33(3)(a) of LODR Regulations.Final Order in the matter of V. B. Industries Limited    Page 7 of 55   4.3.10. The statutory auditor of VBIL i.e. B. S. Kedia & Co. does not have a valid peer review certificate, as issued by Peer Review Board of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), which is in violation of Regulation 33(1)(d) of LODR Regulations.  4.3.11. The management of VBIL failed to upload a policy with respect to materiality of events/information on its website, which is in violation of Regulation 30(4)(ii) of LODR Regulations.  4.3.12. The management of VBIL failed to upload details of familiarization programmes imparted to independent director (during the year and on cumulative basis till date) on its website, which is in violation of Regulation 46(2)(i) of LODR Regulations.  4.3.13. The Company has not prepared its cash flow statements in accordance with Accounting Standard 3-\\\\\\\\u201cCash flow statements\\\\\\\\u201d as prescribed by the Central Government under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, which is in violation of Regulation 34(2)(c) of LODR Regulations.  5. The SCN-II and SCN-III alleged that Noticee no. 8 having firm registration no. 328750E was the statutory auditor of Noticee no. 1 for the financial year 2015-16 and Noticee no. 9 having firm registration no. 317159E was the statutory auditor of Noticee no. 1 for the financial years 2016-17 and 2017-18, respectively. In view of the violation of provisions of SEBI Act, 1992, SCRA, 1956, LODR Regulations and PFUTP Regulations, 2003, by Noticee no. 1, SCN-II and SCN-III alleged that Noticee no. 8 and 9 being the statutory auditor of Noticee no. 1 had been negligent in performance of their duties as they had not carried out proper due diligence and had not reported these findings in their audit reports. Further, SCN \\\\\\\\u2013II and SCN-III alleged that the fact that Noticee no. 1 had not complied with AS-3 and such non-compliance including observations such as adverse features with respect to loans and advances made by the company, high value bank transactions carried out by the company, had not beenFinal Order in the matter of V. B. Industries Limited    Page 8 of 55   pointed out in the audit reports of Noticee no. 1. SCN-II and III also alleged that the books of accounts and financial statements of Noticee no. 1 were incorrect, irregular and misleading. It was further alleged that an unqualified audit opinion stating that financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, had been given by Noticee no. 8 and 9 in their respective audit reports. It was alleged that such certification of annual reports by Noticee no. 8 and 9 had resulted in not only the shareholders but also the public being misled about the financial health of Noticee no.1.  6. I note that Noticee no.1 has filed reply dated March 13, 2021 to the SCN.  In its reply, the said Noticees have produced the copy of the death certificate of Noticee no. 4 (date of demise: November 11, 2019) and Noticee no. 3 (date of demise: October 30, 2019). In view of the same, I note that, the present proceedings against Noticee no. 3 and 4 stand abated. I note that Noticee no. 2, 5 and 6, vide their letter dated March 1, 2020 and Noticee no. 7 vide his letter dated March 12, 2021, have authorized Noticee no. 1 to file all replies to the SCN, on their behalf. Accordingly, reply dated March 13, 2021, as filed by Noticee no. 1, is also being considered as the reply of Noticee no. 2, 5, 6 and 7. Noticee no. 8 has filed his reply dated September 24, 2020 and Noticee no. 9 has filed his reply dated April 23, 2021. The Noticees were granted an opportunity of personal hearing on May 5, 2021, on which date the Noticees were heard.   Consideration of submissions and findings:  7. I have considered the allegations in the SCN, SCN-II and SCN-III, replies received, and submissions made by the Noticees during the personal hearing granted to them. The SCN alleges the violation of the following provisions of law by the Noticee no. 1 to 7:  Relevant extract of the provisions of SEBI Act, 1992:Final Order in the matter of V. B.

Pursuant to receipt of certain complaints, Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) had conducted a preliminary examination in the matter of Five Core Electronics Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cthe company\\\\\\\\u201d), a company which had listed its shares on National Stock Exchange SME Platform on May 21, 2018 by issuing 33,33,000 equity shares of face value of Rs.10 each, at price of Rs.140 per equity share, raising about Rs.46 Crores. The said examination prima facie revealed that the company, its promoters / promoter group entities and /or independent directors (Noticee nos. 1 to 7 named in the Table above) had mis-utilized the funds raised through the IPO and there appeared to be a pre-meditated plan to lure investors with the intention to defraud them. Based on the findings of the examination, the Noticees were alleged to have prima facie violated the provisions of Regulation 3(d) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices__________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Five Core Electronics Limited Page 2 of 5 Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 read with Section 12A(c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 and also various provisions of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (\\\\\\\\u201cLODR Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). In view of the same, SEBI had passed an ex-parte ad-interim order dated July 23, 2020 (\\\\\\\\u201cInterim Order\\\\\\\\u201d), vide which SEBI had inter alia issued the following directions:  (a) The Noticee nos. 1 to 7 are restrained from accessing the securities market and are further prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities in any manner whatsoever, either directly or indirectly, till further orders.  (b) The Noticee nos. 1 to 7 are restrained from being associated with any intermediary registered with SEBI or any listed entity or its material unlisted subsidiary, till further orders.  (c) The Noticee nos. 1 to 7, are restrained from disposing, selling or alienating, in any other manner, their assets or divert funds, till further orders.  (d) NSE shall appoint an independent Auditor/ Audit Firm for conducting a detailed forensic audit of the books of accounts of the company to confirm mis-utilization of IPO proceeds by the company. Such appointment of forensic auditor shall be done within 30 days of this order.  (e) The Noticee nos. 1 to 7 shall extend necessary co\\\\\\\\u2013operation to the independent Auditor/Audit Firms appointed as per this Order and shall furnish all information/documents sought from them from time to time.  (f) The independent Auditor/ Audit Firm so appointed as per this Order shall submit a Report to SEBI through NSE within 3 months of date of its appointment.   2. Prior to the issuance of the Interim Order, NSE had conducted visit to the company at its registered office, its manufacturing site and its R&D Centre on May 06, 2019. NSE observed that all these offices were shut and the same was not informed to the exchange.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Five Core Electronics Limited Page 3 of 5 Further, letters issued by SEBI during the preliminary examination to the company and its Executive Directors and Promoters at their respective addresses seeking their comments on the complaints had returned undelivered. The said letters were later affixed at the registered office of the company at Delhi. However, no replies/comments to the letters were received by SEBI from the company or its directors / promoters. Given that the letters sent to the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 addresses during the preliminary examination had returned undelivered and there was no response from the company even after affixture of letters at its registered address, the Interim Order was served on the Noticees through email by sending to email IDs \\\\\\\\u2013 investcare@5core.in, cs@5core.in, cfo@5core.in and amarjitkalra@yahoo.co.uk. The Interim Order was also uploaded on the SEBI Website. Vide the Interim order, the Noticees were advised to file their replies to the Interim Order within 21 days and also indicate in their replies whether they wanted an opportunity of personal hearing. However, till date, no response whatsoever has been received from the Noticees.   3. As per the directions issued in the Interim Order, NSE had appointed BDO India LLP as a forensic auditor for conducting a detailed forensic audit of the books of accounts of the company to confirm mis-utilization of IPO proceeds by the company. Due to the closure of the company and the absence of its employees/management, the forensic auditor did not get access to books of accounts and the transactional documentation. However, the forensic auditor obtained limited data from different sources, which included bank statements, Limited Review Financial Statements, Prospectus & List of shareholders received from NSE; Bill discounting / packing credit details, sanction letters, customer outstanding details, credit reports etc. received from Andhra Bank; Partial records for__________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Five Core Electronics Limited Page 4 of 5 domestic purchase invoices, bank statements, GST Records received from IBC Resolution Professional; GST Returns (partial records) received from statutory auditor and purchase & sale documentation (partial records) received from Department of Revenue Intelligence. NSE, vide email dated January 25, 2021 submitted the final report of the forensic auditor the findings of which require detailed investigation by SEBI.  4. Considering the fact that the Noticees have failed to respond to the prima facie observations recorded against them in the Interim Order and also the fact that findings of the forensic audit report require detailed investigation, I find that there are no justifiable reasons for dis-continuing or modifying the directions issued vide the Interim Order. However, it has now been brought to my notice that there is a proceeding under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) against the company before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLT, New Delhi Bench (Court II), wherein an order dated January 23, 2020 [IB-1671(ND)2019] has been passed declaring a moratorium in terms of Section 14 of the IBC. The said moratorium has inter alia prohibited the following:  (a) the institution of suits or continuation of pending suits or proceedings against the corporate debtor including execution of any judgement, decree or order in any court of law, tribunal, arbitration panel or other authority;  (b) transferring, encumbering, alienating or disposing of by the corporate debtor any of its assets or any legal right or beneficial interest therein.  ORDER \\\\\\\\u2013  5. In view of the foregoing, in order to protect the interest of investors and the integrity of the securities market, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 19 read__________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Five Core Electronics Limited Page 5 of 5 with Sections 11, 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992, hereby confirm the directions issued against the Noticees, as contained in the Interim Order (reproduced under para 1 of this order), until further orders.

SEBI received the following complaints against Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAllied/ AFSPL/ Noticee No. 1\\\\\\\\u201d), a Depository Participant of NSDL, alleging fraudulent/ unauthorized transfer of mutual fund units (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cMF Units\\\\\\\\u201d): Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 2 of 84   1.1. Complaint dated February 08, 2019, from Finsec Law Advisor on behalf of clients Dalmia Cement East Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cDCEL\\\\\\\\u201d) and OCL India Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cOCL\\\\\\\\u201d) alleging fraudulent transfer of MF Units worth Rs. 344.07 crores by AFSPL (these complainants are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cDalmia Group\\\\\\\\u201d) and   1.2. Complaint dated December 31, 2018, January 18 and 21, 2019 from Novjoy Emporium Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNEPL\\\\\\\\u201d) alleging unauthorized transfer of MF Units worth Rs. 21 crores by AFSPL.  2. SEBI conducted an investigation into the matter for the period February 20, 2017, till February 08, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation period/ IP\\\\\\\\u201d) to determine violations, if any, of provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d), Depositories Act, 1996 (\\\\\\\\u201cDP Act\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (\\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996 (\\\\\\\\u201cDP Regulations 1996\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 2018 (\\\\\\\\u201cDP Regulations 2018\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI (Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSB Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) and relevant circulars issued by SEBI. As part of the investigation, SEBI appointed a forensic auditor, Sarath & Associates, CA, to look into the functioning of AFSPL with regard to the alleged fraudulent transfer of securities from accounts of clients.   SHOW CAUSE NOTICE 3. Pursuant to conclusion of the investigation, a Show Cause Notices (SCN) dated December 09, 2019, was issued to AFSPL, Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra, Mr. Himanshu Arora and Mr. Jitendra Kumar Tiwari (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d). It has been alleged, inter alia, that:  3.1. During the investigation period, there have been fraudulent transfers in the demat accounts of clients, namely, DCEL, OCL and NEPL and MF units have been Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 3 of 84   transferred from their accounts by using Delivery Instruction Slips (DIS). DCEL, OCL and NEPL have claimed that neither have they signed any DIS nor have they authorized these transfers. NEPL has claimed that it was told by AFSPL that high value securities are moved to Digi Locker automatically by NSDL.   3.2. Economic Offences Wing (EOW), on the basis of a police complaint filed by the Dalmia Group, in its charge sheet filed in the matter, has observed that signature on all the DIS used for transferring MF units from the account of DCEL and OCL were forged. Mr. Subhas Sastri, authorized signatory of NEPL, during his statement on oath submitted that signature on the copy of the DIS used for transferred the MF units from the account of NEPL were not his and have been forged. In view of the same, it is alleged that the MF units from the account of NEPL, transferred during the investigation period, were also transferred by AFSPL using forged DIS. 3.3. These MF units were given by AFSPL to IL&FS Securities Services Ltd. (ISSL), the Clearing Member of AFSPL, as margins/ collateral for getting trading exposure on the exchange. This was done despite there being no clear/ specific instructions from Dalmia Group permitting AFSPL to use the MF units as collateral. On the contrary, there were specific instructions from Dalmia Group instructing AFSPL that securities of DCEL/ OCL were meant only for holding purpose. 3.4. Hence, the conduct of AFSPL in carrying out fraudulent transfers of MF units from the demat account of DCEL, OCL and NEPL by using forged DIS is alleged to be a fraud perpetrated on these entities by AFSPL and by the other Noticees, who were its Directors during the IP. Therefore, it has been alleged that the Noticees have violated Regulations 3(a), 4(1) and 4(2)(p) of the PFUTP Regulations.  4. Further, investigation also revealed certain acts/ omissions of the Noticees, which when seen together cohesively, appeared to have led to perpetration of the above mentioned fraud on DCEL, OCL and NEPL. These allegations, which have led to Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 4 of 84   violations of the provisions of the DP Regulations 1996, DP Regulations 2018, SB Regulations and relevant SEBI Circulars, are as below:   With respect to demat accounts of DCEL and OCL:  4.1. Two sets of Account Opening Forms (AOFs) for demat accounts of DCEL and OCL were made available during investigation, one received from AFSPL (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSet 1\\\\\\\\u201d) and the other received from the Dalmia Group (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSet 2\\\\\\\\u201d). It is observed that details, such as, client email ID, address, contact number, etc., in these two AOFs were different. The details entered in the DPM system of NSDL for these accounts were based on Set 1. For e.g., the address of DCEL as per Set 1 is \\\\\\\\u2018H No. 130, Sector-530, Gautam Budh Nagar, Noida, Uttar Pradesh-201301\\\\\\\\u2019, while the same is different as per Set 2. The said address is non-existent as Sector 530 does not exist in Noida and the same was confirmed by Noticee No. 2 during statement recording. Therefore, it is alleged that AFSPL did not carry out proper due diligence at the time of account opening, which is violation of Clause 4 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 20AA of the DP Regulations 1996. 4.2. The fields provided for entering the date of incorporation and date of commencement of business on part I of the KYC application form was pre-printed as DDMMYYYY in Set 2 (given by Dalmia Group), whereas such pre-printed DDMMYYYY was not found on Set 1 (given by AFSPL). However, other than these, the fields provided for entering the dates were pre-printed as DDMMYYYY in both sets. It was also observed that DDMMYYYY was pre-printed in the AOF of other clients of AFSPL. The same shows that there were some anomalies in Set 1 AOF and it is alleged that this AOF appears to be fabricated by AFSPL, which is in violation of Clauses 3, 19 and 22 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 20AA of the DP Regulations 1996. Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 5 of 84   4.3. The authorized signatories have to sign across on the photographs pasted on the KYC documents and also obtain seal of the corporate entity on this page. It is observed that, while the photographs of Mr. Bhabagrahi Pradhan and Mr. Rajesh Ghai, the authorized signatories of OCL, were affixed on the form, there was no signature across the photographs and there was no seal of OCL on the said page. Irrespective of the genuineness of the AOF, the same is not in compliance with the procedure to be followed by a DP while opening a demat account in terms of provisions of SEBI circular CIR/MIRSD/16/2011 dated 22/08/2011, Regulation 29 of the SB Regulations and Clause 4 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 20AA of the DP Regulations 1996. 4.4. The Client Master List (CML) for accounts of DCEL and OCL was generated by AFSPL and sent to DCEL and OCL via emails. It is observed that the CMLs have different details vis-\\\\\\\\xe0-vis the details in the DPM system with respect to communication address, contact details, email, etc., however, the details in the CML matches with the details in Set 2 (given by Dalmia Group). Hence, it is alleged that the CML of DCEL and OCL, as sent by AFSPL to DCEL and OCL, is false and wrong and could not have been generated from the NSDL system, as the data entered in the NSDL system was different (as per Set 1). Therefore, AFSPL allegedly shared fabricated CMLs with the Dalmia Group and has violated Clauses 3, 16 and 19 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 20AA of the DP Regulations 1996. 4.5. For DCEL, AFSPL captured uditagri@gmail.com as the email ID in the DPM system, instead of uditagri01@gmail.com, which was mentioned in the Set 1 AOF. Also, EOW in its charge sheet filed in the matter has observed that signatures on the Set 1 AOF having credentials viz., email address were forged by AFSPL. It is observed that incorrect details were entered by AFSPL in the DPM system of NSDL, which is in violation of Clauses 2(b) and 4 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 20 AA of the DP Regulations 1996. 4.6. As per the format of holding statement sent by AFSPL to DCEL/ OCL, it has to affix its seal and sign on the holding statement; however, it was observed that there was no such authorization on any of the holding statements, except on the Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 6 of 84   holding statement as on 30/09/2018, sent by AFSPL to Dalmia Group. It is alleged that the same is in violation of Clause 2(b) of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 20 AA of the DP Regulations 1996. 4.7. At the request of Dalmia Group, on 08/10/2018, AFSPL provided the Dalmia Group with a holding statement, printed on the letter head of NSDL, and purportedly stamped and signed by NSDL. NSDL has submitted that the rubber stamp and the signature on the said statement were not of NSDL. Therefore, it is observed that the said statement was allegedly forged and was not provided by NSDL and/ or its officials. It appears that AFSPL shared a fabricated holding statement with the Dalmia Group, which is allegedly in violation of Clauses 2(c) and 3 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 36 of the DP Regulations 2018. 4.8. MF Units held by DCEL and OCL were regularly debited and credited from and to their account during FY 2017-18. It was observed that AFSPL had ensured that the securities were transferred back to DCEL and OCL demat accounts as and when positions close and further ensured that these units reflect in the accounts of DCEL and OCL as on March 31, 2018, i.e., on financial year closing day. The Dalmia Group, vide email dated November 08, 2018 (in reply to an email received from AFSPL regarding status of collateral of MF Units of DCEL and OCL), informed AFSPL that the units in their account were not be used as collateral. In reply to which, AFSPL responded that their holding is intact and to read the word collateral as holding. It is observed that although there was clear instruction to AFSPL from Dalmia Group to not to use their MF Units as collateral, the said MF units were debited from the account of DCEL and OCL and were being used as collateral by AFSPL for receiving exposure from ISSL. Further, as per the Consolidated Account Statement (CAS) provided by NSDL on November 09, 2018, DCEL and OCL were not holding any securities in their demat account with AFSPL. Therefore, the email sent by AFSPL indicated that it has misguided its clients with respect to their holdings in the demat accounts with manipulative intent, which is allegedly in violation of Clauses 2(b) and 3 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 20AA of the DP Regulations 1996. Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 7 of 84   4.9. Dalmia Group claimed that they have not signed any DIS for transfer of MF units and also did not receive the DIS booklets from AFSPL. Further, on examination of the documentary evidences, explanations and records provided by AFSPL, Dalmia Group and NSDL, it was observed that the transactions carried out by AFSPL were unauthorized. No documentation was provided by AFSPL, which were in nature of instructions received by AFSPL from Dalmia Group, to carry out the said transactions. It was observed that these MF units were being used as collateral for taking exposure from ISSL. Further, some affiliate entities of Dalmia Group had trading accounts with AFSPL and payments were also made by AFSPL to these affiliate entities. However, AFSPL could not provide documentary evidence to show that the MF Units of DCEL and OCL were being used as collateral for taking exposure from ISSL for supporting the trading activities of Dalmia affiliated entities. In fact, Dalmia Group, vide email dated November 08, 2018, had given specific instructions to AFSPL that their MF Units were not to be collateralized for any purpose; however, MF Units were being used as collateral by AFSPL for taking exposure from ISSL. DIS number 152721, which consisted of incorrect ISIN no., has been used in executing transfer of MF Units from the account of OCL by AFSPL. It is observed that EOW, in its charge sheet filed in the matter, has observed that signature on all the DIS used for transferring MF Units from the account of DCEL and OCL were forged. Hence, it is alleged that AFSPL has violated Clauses 1, 2(b), 3, 4 and 22 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 20AA of the DP Regulations 1996. 4.10. AFSPL had sent an email to Dalmia Group in October 2018 that they will not be able to maintain their demat accounts and will transfer the MF Units to their other demat accounts. However, the same was not done despite Dalmia Group providing AFSPL with details of their other demat account. Hence, it is alleged that AFSPL has violated Clauses 2(b), 2(c), 2(d) and 5 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 36 of the DP Regulations 2018. 4.11. On the change request form dated October 04, 2018, signed by Mr. Bijay Agarwal, the email ID for the account of OCL was mentioned as aggrawal.bijay@dalmiabharat.com, with a spelling mistake, and the same was Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 8 of 84   captured in the DPM system of AFSPL. However, Mr. Bijay Agrawal is not an authorized signatory for the account of OCL. Irrespective of the question of the genuineness of the said document, the same indicated fraudulent intent of AFSPL as email ID was changed by them in the DPM system based on the purported request by a person who was not the authorized signatory of OCL as per the resolution of the company. AFSPL had captured agarwal.bijay@dalmiabharat.com as the email ID and \\\\\\\\u201c9999329975\\\\\\\\u201d as mobile number in the DPM system on October 4, 2018, for the demat account of DCEL. However, AFSPL could not provide any change request in support of the same and it is alleged that changes were made by AFSPL without any authorization. It is alleged that AFSPL violated Clauses 2(b), 3, 16 and 22 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 36 of the DP Regulations 2018. 4.12. AFSPL could not provide acknowledgment receipt for the first DIS booklet, with series number 151661-680, purportedly issued to DCEL on February 21, 2017. On the acknowledgment of third DIS booklet, with series number 154481 to 154500, purportedly issued by AFSPL to OCL on July 09, 2018, the DIS series was mentioned wrongly. It is alleged that AFSPL violated Clause 2(b) of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 20AA of the DP Regulations 1996.  With respect to demat account of NEPL:  4.13. DIS booklet with series number 148211 to 148220 was issued to NEPL by AFSPL at the time of account opening and the same was never used by NEPL. Further, DIS booklet with series number 148241 to 148250 was used to transfer MF Units from the NEPL account and AFSPL could not produce the request and acknowledgement receipt for the issuance of this DIS booklet. NEPL has claimed that they never applied/ requested to AFSPL to issue a new DIS booklet. Further, DIS booklet (148211 to 148220) was not entered into the DPM system at the time of account opening and it was done after the MF units had already been transferred using DIS booklet (148241 to 148250). Despite the first DIS booklet being completely unused, the second DIS booklet was entered in Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 9 of 84   the DPM system and used even before the first DIS booklet was entered in the system by AFSPL. Also, there was delay by AFSPL in updating the first DIS booklet issued to NEPL in the NSDL system and AFSPL has violated Para 6 of SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/01/2014 dated January 07, 2014. It is alleged that AFSPL violated Clause 2(b) of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 36 of the DP Regulations 2018. 4.14. AFSPL vide email dated 05/12/2018 forwarded account statement of NEPL to the email ID of the consultant of NEPL instead of forwarding it to the registered email ID of NEPL. In the said email, MF Units of NEPL were being shown as held in the account of Mutual Fund Digi Locker (MFDL) (client ID: 10063773). However, as per the NSDL system, the said demat account was actually held in the name of Mr. Pankaj Garg and Mr. Jitendra Malhotra, who are partners of MFDL and employees of AFSPL, and not in the name of MFDL. The same is as per the guidelines for account opening for a partnership firm. Since, the statement forwarded by AFSPL showed the units to be held by MFDL instead of Mr. Pankaj Garg and Mr. Jitendra Malhotra, it is observed that a fabricated statement was forwarded by AFSPL to NEPL. Also the said email was forwarded to an email ID which was not registered for that account. It is alleged that AFSPL violated Clauses 2(b), 3, 9 and 22 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 36 of the DP Regulations 2018. 4.15. MF units were transferred from the account of NEPL by AFSPL. Economic Offences Wing (EOW), in its charge sheet filed in the matter, has observed that signature on the DIS used for transferring MF Units from the account of DCEL and OCL were forged. Mr. Subhas Sastri, authorized signatory of NEPL, during his statement on oath submitted that signature on the copy of the DIS used for transferring the MF Units from the account of NEPL were not his and have been forged. Mr. Sastri also submitted that the rubber stamp used on the said DIS was not of NEPL. In view of the same, it is likely that signatures on the DIS used for transferring MF units from the account of NEPL were also forged by AFSPL. In view of the same, AFSPL has violated Clauses 1, 2(b), 3, 4 and 22 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 20AA of the DP Regulations 1996. Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 10 of 84   5. Apart from the above, investigation also revealed other facts constituting various other violations, which are as below:  5.1. AFSPL failed to provide DIS issue register for verification during the investigation along with other information sought from AFSPL, which included email backup, details of second DIS issued to NEPL, etc. Thereby, AFSPL failed to comply with the direction given to it vide SEBI letter dated June 10, 2019. This is in violation of Regulations 86(1) read with 86(3) and Clauses 10, 13 and 17 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 36 of the DP Regulations 2018.  5.2. AFSPL did not have any compliance officer, which is mandated as per DP Regulations and no such information/ records were submitted by AFSPL in respect of the same during the course of investigation. This is in violation of Regulation 81(1) of the DP Regulations 2018. 5.3. In December 2018, NSDL had issued a letter imposing penalty on AFSPL for non-compliance pertaining to inspection conducted by NSDL as per the uniform penalty structure. However, AFSPL failed to inform the same to SEBI as required by the DP Regulations. This is in violation of Clause 14 of the Code of Conduct of the DP Regulations 2018.  6. In view of the above allegations, Noticee Nos 1 to 4 were called upon to show cause as to why appropriate directions:  6.1. Under Sections 11B(1) and 11(4) read with Section 11(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992, and Section 19(1) of the Depositories Act, 1996, including return of MF Units to the respective clients which were fraudulently transferred from the accounts of DCEL, OCL and NEPL, should not be issued against them for the alleged violations of the aforementioned provisions of SEBI Act, Depositories Act, PFUTP Regulations, DP Regulations, SEBI (Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992, and SEBI Circulars. 6.2. For imposing penalty under Sections 11B(2) and 11(4A) read with Sections 15HA and 15HB of the SEBI Act and Sections 19(2) and 19G of the Depositories Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 11 of 84   Act, should not be issued against them for the alleged violations of the aforementioned provisions of SEBI Act, Depositories Act, PFUTP Regulations, DP Regulations, SEBI (Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992, and SEBI Circulars.

The Noticees have also alleged that employees and/ or office bearers of the Dalmia Group were fully aware of and had authorized the transfer of MF units from accounts of DCEL and OCL, which were actually given as loan to AFSPL to be used as collateral for margin trading to generate income in the accounts of their related entities. Various documents, emails, WhatsApp chats, etc., have been submitted in support of these allegations. Submissions in this regard are given below:  13.1. Mr. Puneet Dalmia, MD of Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as DCBL) met Noticee No. 2 somewhere in middle of 2016 and discussed a proposal regarding trading in derivative segment of NSE. He explained the concept of advance income wherein he wanted to utilize the dead assets/ promoter shares of Dalmia Group companies as collateral to get a high margin in order to do trading in derivatives market. He proposed that AFSPL would sell Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 13 of 84   long dated option contracts, collect the premium, take the premium as advance income and transfer the same to promoter related companies of Dalmia Group. 13.2. Several phone calls have been exchanged between Mr. Puneet Dalmia, relatives of Mr. Dalmia and Mr. Bijay Agrawal, GM (Finance) and Treasury Head of Dalmia Bharat, with Noticee No. 2 regarding opening of accounts of Dalmia Group companies with AFSPL. 13.3. On November 22, 2016, Mr. Agrawal sent email to Noticee No. 2 asking for documents to open account of Dalmia Group promoter companies. He was informed that AFSPL was a very small broker and had networth issues to handle such big accounts. On January 2, 2017, employee of Dalmia group sent another email asking for more information on account opening. Noticee has attached these emails. 13.4. Mr. Puneet Dalmia opened accounts of a companies, namely, Shri Vallabh Orthopedic Instruments Pvt. Ltd. (VOIP) and Cointribe Technologies Pvt. Ltd., on December 21, 2016, and December 28, 2016, respectively. Mr. Dalmia had 50% share capital in Cointribe. Thereafter, nine accounts of entities related to Dalmia group were opened in next 5 months. The objective was that upon instructions of Mr. Dalmia, dead assets/ promoter shares of OCL, would be transferred to demat account of VOIP so that a big margin could be created in order to trade in derivatives and the income generated would be deposited in the account of Cointribe. This was planned such that the returns/ income received in the aforesaid transactions would neither show up in the balance sheet of OCL nor come to the notice of RoC, SEBI and NSE. These demat accounts were opened with AFSPL even when these entities had demat and trading account with other intermediaries. 13.5. Shares of OCL worth Rs. 92-100 crores were transferred to the demat account of VOIP on December 30 and 31, 2016. The authorized signatories of OCL were the same who got the shares transferred from another DP of Dalmia Group, namely J M Financial Services Ltd. into the account of AFSPL, without any complaint of forgery of signatures. Noticee has attached CML and demat statement of VOIP. Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 14 of 84   13.6. These shares were offered as collateral to Axis Securities Ltd., the then clearing member of AFSPL, who refused to provide margin due to liquidity constraints. This was communicated to Mr. Agrawal and Mr. Jayesh Doshi through emails, which have been attached. Subsequently, the account of VOIP was closed and securities were repatriated back to OCL. The DIS to transfer these shares back was also signed by the same authorized signatories of OCL who signed DIS to transfer MF units to associate entities of AFSPL. Such transfer of large quantities of shares of OCL and subsequent repatriation in the short span of time clearly shows the intention of Mr. Dalmia to clandestinely transfer promoter shares into a third company have demat account with AFSPL and then use them for his proposal to generate income. Noticee has attached email dated January 24, 2017, exchanged with employees of Money Mishra Financial Services (promoter of AFSPL) and DCBL regarding use of shares of OCL as collateral for margin trading. 13.7. Mr. Dalmia then suggested use of MF units of Dalmia Group companies as collateral and suggested the name of ISSL as a clearing member. It was inquired with ISSL if they would accept MF units as collateral to give margin for derivatives trading and ISSL agreed to the same. 13.8. Mr. Bijay Agrawal, GM (Finance) and Head of Treasury, Dalmia Group, vide two emails shared list of schemes and requested AFSPL to check whether these units were eligible under NSE list for use as collateral. Affirmative reply was sent by AFSPL. Noticee has attached these emails. 13.9. As the MF units were in physical form, Mr. Puneet Dalmia got permission from the Board of Directors of DCBL and OCL for holding the MF investments upto Rs. 350 crores in demat form. Father-in-law of Mr. Dalmia, Mr. Vinod Poddar, was instrumental in getting the MF units of Dalmia Group dematerialized through the RTA of Dalmia Group. This shows that the Board of aforesaid companies were aware of the dematerialization of MF investments of Dalmia Group and their use as collateral. 13.10. Demat accounts of DCEL and OCL were opened and as Mr. Dalmia did not want to give MF units directly to clearing member as collateral as it would Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 15 of 84   appear in the balance sheet of these companies, he did not open their trading accounts. Noticee has attached an email from employee of Dalmia Group asking for income certificate. 13.11. In January 2017, Mr. Dalmia told Noticee No. 2 that he wanted more income in the account of Cointribe on immediate basis and transferred Rs. 4 crores to the account and told AFSPL to generate return in derivative market. Noticee has attached financial ledger showing payment of Rs. 4 crores. Subsequently, the Rs. 4 crores was taken back from AFSPL. Despite nil investment with AFSPL, Mr. Dalmia wanted to show income of around Rs. 15 crores in Cointribe in FY 2016-17, to fudge financial parameters of Cointribe, to make it attractive to private equity investors and to sell his stake. Mr. Dalmia then asked AFSPL to use the funds and securities of its retail investors for making payments to Cointribe as gains on income from derivatives and assured that he would make good these diverted funds and liquidated securities. On his assurance, AFSPL diverted cash and liquidated securities either directly into account of Cointribe or by routing through MMFS. Cointribe fraudulently showed an income of Rs. 15 crores in FY 2016-17. 13.12. In FY 2017-18, Mr. Dalmia wanted much more managed income in Cointribe, without investing much in Cointribe. He apprised AFSPL that he needed advance earnings in his promoter group companies, especially in Cointribe, which would be offset against use of securities of Dalmia Group. He assured AFSPL that these securities would remain with AFSPL for next 5 years. 13.13. Bogus investments were made in AFSPL where funds were first transferred and then subsequently taken back. In order to make good for monies diverted from the retail investor accounts into accounts of Dalmia Group entities, Mr. Dalmia directed AFSPL to use the MF units of Dalmia Group as collateral for margin trading. 13.14. Upon instructions of Mr. Dalmia, Mr. Bijay Agrawal provided signed DIS to transfer MF units held by OCL and DCEL into demat accounts of MMFS, MMOPL and Noticee No. 2. This loan of MF units was given for a consideration which varied from 0.2% to 0.6% p.m. of the value of the units, depending on Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd.                           Page 16 of 84   market sentiment and availability of margin. Noticee has attached emails showing a return matrix on basis of units of DSP Blackrock Banking and PSU Debt fund offered by Dalmia Group.

Ltd.   BACKGROUND  1. SEBI received the following complaints against Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAllied/ AFSPL\\\\\\\\u201d), a Depository Participant of NSDL, alleging fraudulent/ unauthorized transfer of mutual fund units (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cMF Units\\\\\\\\u201d):  1.1. Complaint dated February 08, 2019, from Finsec Law Advisor on behalf of clients Dalmia Cement East Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cDCEL\\\\\\\\u201d) and OCL India Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cOCL\\\\\\\\u201d) alleging fraudulent transfer of MF Units worth Rs. 344.07 crores by AFSPL (these complainants are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cDalmia Group\\\\\\\\u201d) and Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 2 of 68   1.2. Dalmia Group, vide letter dated February 27, 2019, alleged that ILFS Securities Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cISSL/ Noticee\\\\\\\\u201d), a clearing member of NSE Clearing Limited, was also involved in the fraudulent transfer of MF Units from the accounts of DCEL and OCL.  2. SEBI conducted an investigation into the matter for the period from February 20, 2017, till February 08, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cinvestigation period/ IP\\\\\\\\u201d) to determine violations of any provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (\\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI (Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSB Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), bye-laws/ regulations/ rules of the NSE Clearing Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cNCL\\\\\\\\u201d) and relevant circulars issued by SEBI. As part of the investigation, SEBI received the copies of the following reports related to the Noticee:   2.1. Special review carried out by Grant Thornton to look into the dealings of the Noticee with AFSPL (Grant Thornton was appointed by the Noticee itself for this audit) and 2.2. NCL\\\\\\\\u2019s Inspection Report with respect to functioning of the Noticee as a clearing member.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE  3. Pursuant to conclusion of the investigation, vide Show Cause Notice (SCN) dated December 09, 2019, the following factual and legal allegations were made against the Noticee:  3.1. There were certain irregularities while on-boarding AFSPL by the Noticee. The said irregularities were: Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 3 of 68   3.1.1. Different CA certificates with different financial statements and shareholding patterns were submitted by AFSPL to MCA/ NSE and to the Noticee. 3.1.2. Anomalies noted in the KYC pertaining to existing relationship of AFSPL with the IL&FS group. 3.1.3. Anomalies noted regarding income of AFSPL in the KYC. 3.1.4. Noticee ignored significant unusual increase in the asset size of AFSPL during FY 2017-18. 3.1.5. Noticee ignored AFSPL having multiple doubtful transactions with related parties where the recovery was doubtful.   3.2. In terms of Regulations 11.3.1 of Chapter 11 of NCL F&O Regulations, a Clearing Member (\\\\\\\\u201cCM\\\\\\\\u201d) is required to do proper due diligence when establishing relationship with a new client. Also, CMs must take reasonable steps to assess the background, genuineness, financial soundness of such person and his objectives, which was not done in the instant case. In view of the aforesaid, prima facie, non-compliance with respect to carrying out proper due diligence was observed when the Noticee established relationship with AFSPL which has allegedly resulted in violation of Clauses A(2) & A(5) of the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II of Regulation 9(f) of the SEBI (Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cBroker Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) read with Regulation 10F of the Broker Regulations and Regulation 11.3.1 of Chapter 11 of NCL F&O Regulations.  3.3. There were four (04) instances where collateral was released by the Noticee to AFSPL without corresponding reduction in exposure/ margin requirements. The aforesaid instances of release of collaterals over weekends were unusual. The said release of collateral by the Noticee helped AFSPL to make Dalmia Group believe that their MF Units were intact in their respective demat accounts. Details of which are as under: Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 4 of 68      3.4. It was also observed that intra-day limits provided by the Noticee to AFSPL were enhanced without sufficient collateral inflow (naked benefit) and were reduced at end of the day. During July 02, 2018, to December 27, 2018, there were 65 instances/ trading days where total amount of intra-day benefit extended to AFSPL by the Noticee amounted to Rs. 2417.87 crores. The same had resulted in increased risk for the Noticee. In view of the same, it is alleged that there was a failure to collect margin by the Noticee from AFSPL in accordance with Regulation 4.5.1 of NCL Regulations (F&O segment). In view of the above, prima facie, non-compliance by the Noticee with respect to collection of margin was observed which is in violation of Clauses A(2) and A(5) of the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II of Regulation 9(f) read with Regulation 10F of the Broker Regulations and Regulation 4.5.1 of Chapter 4 of NCL F&O Regulations.  3.5. The Noticee opened trading terminal for AFSPL and allowed them to roll over their position during January 2019, specifically after the termination notice was issued to AFSPL by the Noticee. In terms of Bye-Law 3 of Chapter IX of NCL (F&O Segment) Bye-Law, the Noticee had the option to close-out the positions in the month of January 2019 after failure by AFSPL to pay the margins. Therefore, the Noticee by allowing AFSPL to roll over their position even after termination of their contract has, prima facie, violated Clauses A(2) and A(5) of the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II of Regulation 9(f) read with Regulation 10F of the Broker Regulations and Bye-Law 3 of Chapter IX of NCL (F&O Segment) Bye-Law.

Inter Corporate Deposits (ICDs), interest on ICDs, loan to IL&FS Employee Welfare Trust, interest on loan, sundry debtors were not considered under the header \\\\\\\\u201cdoubtful debts and advances\\\\\\\\u201d for calculation of networth by the Noticee. Instances of the same are as under:  Sr. No. Particulars 1 Networth as on September 30, 2018, after deducting ICDs, interest on ICDs, loan to IL&FS Employee Welfare trust, Interest on loan, Impact of IND AS and Sundry Debtors of Rs. (154.06) Cr., Networth as on September 30, 2018, is Rs. 53.01 Cr. As against Networth submission of member of Rs. 207.07 Cr. 2 After deducting ICDs amounting to Rs. 750 Cr., Networth as on March 31, 2018 is Rs. (573.01) Cr., as against Networth submission of member of Rs. 176.99 Cr.  3.7. If the Noticee had duly considered the aforesaid ICDs under the head doubtful debts and advances, it would have revealed the shortfall in its networth and thereby resulting into non-compliance of Rule 12 of Chapter IV of the Rules of NSE Clearing Limited. Since the Noticee has failed to meet the minimum networth, the same is, prima facie, in violation of Clauses A(2) and A(5) of the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II of Regulation 9(f) read with Regulation 10F of the Broker Regulations and Rule 12 of Chapter IV of the Rules of NSE Clearing Limited.  4. It has been alleged in the SCN that the aforesaid actions/ lapses of the Noticee have allegedly facilitated AFSPL in executing fraudulent transfer of MF Units from the account of DCEL, OCL and another entity named Novjoy Emporium Pvt. Ltd. (NEPL). Therefore, it is alleged that the Noticee has violated Regulation 3(a) and 4(1) of the PFUTP Regulations.  5. In view of the above allegations, the Noticee is called upon to show cause as to why: Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 6 of 68   5.1. Appropriate directions under Sections 11B(1) and 11(4) read with Section 11(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992, should not be issued against it for the alleged violations of the aforementioned provisions of the Broker Regulations and the PFUTP Regulations.  5.2. Appropriate directions for imposing penalty under Section 11B(2) and 11(4A) read with Sections 15HA and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992, should not be issued against it for the alleged violations of the aforementioned provisions of the Broker Regulations and the PFUTP Regulations.  REPLY, WRITTEN SUBMISSION AND ADDITIONAL SUBMISSION:  6. I note that the SCN has been duly delivered to the Noticee and its reply was received vide letter dated January 16, 2020. The Noticee sought inspection of documents, which was also granted. Opportunity of personal hearing was also granted to the Noticee, initially on May 21, 2020, which was adjourned, due to administrative exigencies to, June 26, 2020, and November 02, 2020, respectively. The Noticee sought adjournment of the personal hearing on grounds of non-availability of senior counsel and accordingly, the hearing was adjourned to November 18, 2020.   7. In the hearing held on November 18, 2020, the Noticee raised issues related to jurisdiction of SEBI due to presence of orders of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT in respect of the IL&FS Group and its group companies, including ISSL, which granted an interim stay on institution/ continuation of suits or proceedings against them. It was submitted that the present proceedings before the WTM of SEBI were quasi-judicial proceedings and were covered by the moratorium granted vide the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT. The Noticee prayed that SEBI should first pass an order deciding whether it has the jurisdiction to adjudicate on the issues under the SCN in view of the moratorium order against IL&FS Group and its subsidiaries. Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 7 of 68   8. After, due consideration of the submissions of the Noticee, SEBI, vide its order dated January 08, 2021, held that it has the jurisdiction to proceed to determine whether the Noticee has violated the regulatory provisions mentioned in the SCN. It was also held that SEBI has the jurisdiction to determine the monetary and non-monetary liabilities of the Noticee in the event it is found that the Noticee is in violation of regulatory provisions; however, the enforcement of the liability, if any, shall be subject to the orders of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLT/ Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT/ Appellate Authority from NCLAT.  9. Subsequently, the Noticee preferred an appeal before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) against the above-mentioned order of SEBI, which was dismissed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT vide its order dated April 06, 2021. The Noticee has informed that it has preferred a Civil Appeal in the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, which is pending. Thereafter, the personal hearing of the Noticee took place on April 12, 2021, wherein the Noticee made its submissions on merits. Written submissions were received vide email dated May 05, 2021, and another hearing, with respect to a limited point of their submissions, was held on June 01, 2021. Submissions post this hearing have been received vide letter dated June 14, 2021.  ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION:  10. Before proceeding further, as part of its submissions, the Noticee has raised certain preliminary objections to these proceedings, which are dealt with below.  Civil Appeal pending in the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court:  11. In view of the Civil Appeal pending in the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, the Noticee has prayed that SEBI should refrain from passing any final order in this matter until the Civil Appeal is heard and disposed of. I note here that while the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court heard the appeal on May 11, 2021, no stay has been granted on the current proceedings; however, it has been directed that any orders passed by the SEBI shall Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 8 of 68   be subject to the further order passed by the Court. Hence, this Order shall be subject to the order passed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court.   No evidence furnished on how movement of MF units is linked with Dalmia Group:  12. The Noticee, in its reply dated January 16, 2020, had submitted that no evidence has been furnished on how the movement of MF units were linked to the Dalmia Group and the same has not been elaborated in the SCN. Hence, the same demonstrates that the allegation is merely conjecture. Subsequent to the personal hearing granted on April 12, 2021, certain documents in support of the allegation as to how the movement of MF units is linked to the Dalmia Group were provided to the Noticee.  13. The Noticee was also afforded another opportunity of personal hearing to put forth its oral submissions on these documents, which was held on June 01, 2021, and subsequently the Noticee has contended the following in this regard:   13.1. It is alleged in the purported complaint filed by the Dalmia Group that the transaction statements/ demat ledger statements were incorrect. As alleged fraud is yet to be decided, SEBI ought not to rely on these demat ledger statements. 13.2. Documents have been furnished in an improper manner and demonstrate an inconsistent approach by SEBI. These documents were not provided when ISSL sought inspection of documents relied upon while issuing the SCN. At the hearing on April 12, 2021, SEBI categorically made a statement that no further documents are being relied upon other than the documents already furnished. On this basis, the hearing in the SCN proceeded and the matter was reserved for orders. These documents were provided subsequently. 13.3. Therefore, clearly even as per SEBI, the documents did not form the basis for issuance of the SCN. However, after the final hearing was complete, SEBI has provided the documents purporting that the documents substantiate the allegation that release of collateral by ISSL helped AFSPL make Dalmia believe Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 9 of 68   that the MF Units were intact in their demat accounts. The same indicates that SEBI is attempting to supplement the record on the basis of which the SCN was issued by introducing documents at a belated stage. 13.4. Without prejudice to the foregoing, SEBI has adopted an a-probatory and re-probatory stance while furnishing documents, which cannot be countenanced given that SEBI is a Tribunal in so far as it exercises power under Section 11B (2) and 11 (4A) of the SEBI Act.  14. In this regard, I note that the complaint of the Dalmia Group has only formed the trigger for the investigation in the instant matter, including into the role of ISSL. The extant SCN has been issued after the investigation has been carried out. The transaction statements for the demat accounts of DCEL and OCL have been provided by NSDL, which is a front line regulator, and I have no reason to doubt their authenticity unless the Noticee provides any evidence that there is a flaw or defect in these statements.   15. With regard to the manner in which these documents have been furnished, I note the following:  15.1. The Noticee had sought inspection of documents and an opportunity for the same was provided to it. Thereafter, the Noticee, vide its reply dated January 16, 2020, raised the issue that the necessary evidence to link the movement of the MF units with the Dalmia Group has not been provided. In light of this contention, the relevant documents were provided to the Noticee.    15.2. Further, the issue raised by the Noticee that it was denied the opportunity to make oral submissions with respect to these documents has also been addressed by providing it another opportunity of personal hearing for the same. The Noticee has duly availed the same and has made additional written submissions subsequent to the same. Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 10 of 68   16. The proceedings before the quasi-judicial forum are driven by the principles of natural justice in view of the fact that the procedures mentioned in the Civil Procedure Code, except expressly provided under the SEBI Act, is not applicable. In such proceedings, SEBI needs to ensure that no prejudice is caused to the Noticee and that principles of natural justice have been followed at all times. From the above, I note that no prejudice has been caused to the Noticee as (a) the documents relevant to establish the allegation have been provided to it and (b) it was also given an opportunity to make its oral and written submissions on these documents. I note that at no stage has the Noticee been deprived of an opportunity to defend itself against the allegations made in the SCN and there is no violation of the principles of natural justice that are required to be followed in such proceedings. Further, as already decided by SEBI vide Order dated January 08, 2021, it is not a Tribunal and this Order has also been upheld by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, while appeal against the same is pending in the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court  Request for cross-examination:  17. The Noticee had, vide email dated June 24, 2020, requested that ISSL be permitted to cross-examine the signatories to the complaints relied in the SCN as well as the author of the limited inspection report by the NSE Clearing Limited. It was submitted that as the SCN relies on the statements set out in the complaints of the third parties and the statements recorded in the inspection report, ISSL was entitled to cross-examine such persons. Without this opportunity, SEBI cannot rely upon the complaints and the limited inspection report. In this regard, I note the following:  17.1. The complaints of the Dalmia Group and NEPL, which are annexures to the SCN, have not been relied upon for the allegations made in the SCN against ISSL and in the present proceedings. These complaints formed the trigger for the investigation in the instant matter, including into the role of ISSL. Hence, I note that there is no requirement of providing cross-examination in this regard. Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 11 of 68   17.2. With regard to the NCL Inspection Report, which is also an annexure to the SCN, I note that certain findings of this report have been relied upon for the allegations made in the SCN. These allegations are mentioned at paras 3.3 (return of collateral by ISSL to AFSPL) and 3.6 (discrepancies in networth of ISSL). In this regard, I note the following:  17.2.1. SEBI has not relied on any part of the NCL report that contains any statement(s) made by the inspection team of NCL in the report or findings that have been arrived at on the basis of any statement(s) of the officials of NCL. Further, I note that SEBI has not recorded the statement of any of the officials of NCL as part of its investigation. 17.2.2. I further note that the inspection team of NCL has collected data, which has been provided by ISSL itself, and based on analysis of this data, have arrived at their findings. For e.g., with regard to the allegation of return of collateral by ISSL, the NCL report mentions that the demat statement of ISSL was analyzed for transactions w.r.t. AFSPL. With regard to the allegation of discrepancy in networth of ISSL, the NCL report mentions that information was sought from ISSL to examine the impact of ICDs on its networth and the findings have been derived from this information itself. These findings are not based on statements of any person. 17.2.3. Hence, the findings arrived at by the inspecting team of NCL are based on data which was provided by the Noticee. Further, NCL sought comments of ISSL w.r.t. its findings and I note that the Noticee has given the same reply that it has given to this SCN. I note that at no stage of these proceedings has the Noticee contested the accuracy of the figures/ data mentioned in these findings. It has not raised any discrepancy for e.g., on the amount of MF units released, shortfall in margin, etc. I also note that being the Clearing Member of AFSPL, ISSL already has the data w.r.t. Total Margin, Cash and Securities for the dates mentioned in the table. Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 12 of 68   17.2.4. SEBI, after considering the relevant information/ data from NCL Report and the submissions of ISSL to the same, has also arrived at these findings as part of its investigation into the matter.  17.3. Hence, in view of the above, I note that there is no scope for cross examination of the persons sought to be cross examined by the Noticee.  Fraud has not been crystallized by SEBI:  18. In this regard, the Noticee has submitted the following:  18.1. SEBI has not completed its investigation into the fraud and has not even initiated the proceeding to crystalize the fraud perpetrated. Therefore, ISSL cannot be made liable for facilitating the fraud. 18.2. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, vide its Order dated July 03, 2019, while recording that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026Whether there has been a fraudulent transfer of mutual funds units by Allied to ISSL is a question which is required to be decided by some authority.\\\\\\\\u201d, directed SEBI to determine this question. Instead, SEBI has challenged this order before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, which is presently pending. Therefore, presently, SEBI has admittedly not conducted and/ or completed an inquiry/ investigation to determine whether there was a fraudulent transfer of MF units to ISSL. Hence, it would be incongruous, beyond reason to conduct these proceedings. 18.3. SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s confirmatory order dated May 17, 2019, holds that an independent investigation is ongoing by SEBI to inter alia look into the transfers of MF units. This fact is recorded in the NCL order dated June 24, 2019, and in the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court dated March 16, 2021. Even in the personal hearing, when queried, SEBI has categorically admitted that the investigation is not complete. Hence, it would be contrary to basic principles of law to conduct a hearing for alleged facilitation of fraud. Therefore, the present proceedings against ISSL are untenable and ought not to be continued. Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 13 of 68   19. In this regard, I note the following:   19.1. With respect to the reference made to the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, I note that this order pertains to the application for annulment of trades entered into by AFSPL in the month of December 2018. The application for trade annulment was made by ISSL on the grounds that the contracts entered into by AFSPL in December 2018 were based on fraudulently transferred collaterals and that the same was not in the interest of the securities market. The parties to these proceedings also included DCEL, OCL, AFSPL and 44 other investors. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT has held that whether the MF units used as collateral for the December 2018 contracts were fraudulently transferred from AFSPL to ISSL is a question which has to be decided by some authority. SEBI has been directed to hear all the parties concerned and take a conscious decision by a reasoned and speaking order. I note that SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s appeal against this order is pending in the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court.   19.2. The present SCN issued to ISSL is, inter alia, for adjudging whether the Noticee has facilitated AFSPL in executing fraudulent transfer of MF Units from the account of DCEL, OCL and another entity named Novjoy Emporium Pvt. Ltd. (NEPL). The allegations of fraud and facilitation of fraud can be alleged concurrently. It is not a sine qua non for allegation of facilitation of fraud, that the determination of fraud should have been crystallized before the allegation of facilitation is levelled.   19.3. Further, the submission of the Noticee that SEBI admitted during personal hearing that the investigation into the transfer of MF units is incomplete is not correct. It was communicated to the Noticee during the personal hearing that the investigation into the alleged fraudulent acts of AFSPL has been completed and an SCN has been issued to AFSPL. This SCN has been disposed of by order dated July 02, 2021. Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 14 of 68   19.4. There is no requirement that SEBI was required to first determine the role of AFSPL and then proceed against ISSL. Investigation into the allegations made by DCEL, OCL and NEPL have resulted into issuance of SCN to AFSPL, which has since been disposed of, and also to ISSL. The extant SCN alleges how the Noticee has facilitated AFSL in the execution of fraudulent transfer of MF units from the accounts of DCEL, OCL and NEPL.  Examination into the possible collusion between AFSPL and Directors and/ or officials of the Dalmia Group:  20. In this regard, the Noticee has submitted the following:   20.1. AFSPL, in its affidavit submitted before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India, has laid down details of alleged nature of business relationship existing between DCEL and AFSPL. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, after considering all allegations and counter allegations by and between ISSL, Dalmia and AFSPL, while considering an interlocutory application in the appeal filed by SEBI, has categorically opined that substantial doubts have been raised by the Dalmia Group and ISSL regarding each other\\\\\\\\u2019s involvement/collusion with Allied in perpetrating the alleged fraud.   20.2. Therefore, the role of Dalmia Group also needs thorough examination by SEBI and other regulatory authorities as possibility of collusion between AFSPL and Director and/ or officials of DCEL cannot be ruled out. SEBI has issued an SCN without having done this investigation. The FIR filed by the Dalmia Group also contains material mis-statements including the role of ISSL as an intermediary.  20.3. In cases where there are allegations of fraud, all parties allegedly privy to the fraud ought to be joined. Therefore, AFSPL and Dalmia also ought to have been made a party to the present proceedings. It is noted that the PFUTP Regulations prevents acts of commission and omission, which are fraudulent or unfair in Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 15 of 68   nature. The facilitation of fraud is an \\\\\\\\u201cact\\\\\\\\u201d of \\\\\\\\u201comission\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201ccommission\\\\\\\\u201d, which itself is treated as fraudulent as per the PFUTP Regulations if it facilitates any other fraud.   20.4. The objective of the PFUTP Regulations is to prevent the commission of \\\\\\\\u201cfacilitation\\\\\\\\u201d in the same way the other fraudulent \\\\\\\\u201cact\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201comission\\\\\\\\u201d which is facilitated by the facilitating act or commission. Therefore, even if the facilitated act does not get fructified, it does not make the \\\\\\\\u201cfacilitating act or omission\\\\\\\\u201d legal and/ or permissible. In other words, for a proceeding against the \\\\\\\\u201cact\\\\\\\\u201d of facilitation, it is not material whether the facilitated act of fraud has fructified or not and/ or who have participated in such facilitated act of fraud. Whether the same has fructified is not material for a proceeding against the Noticee for an allegation of commission of fraudulent conduct of facilitation. The facilitator is not required to be aware of the entire gamut of fraudulent act facilitated by him. However, there should be circumstances that raise red flags requiring further enquiry to be made, which the facilitator choses to not to make. Raising of relevant queries would have brought to his actual knowledge, the gamut of fraud regarding which he was not actually aware. The omission to make such enquiry despite the circumstances of red flags, coupled with the acts of commission, taints the act as facilitation. As facilitation itself is fraud separate from the fraudulent act which is facilitated, the contention that AFSPL, Dalmia all parties allegedly privy to the fraud ought to be joined in the present proceedings is not sustainable.   21. In this regard, I note that many of the allegations and counter-allegations between the Dalmia Group and AFSPL fall within the realm of a private dispute between the two. SEBI is not a forum for the adjudication of such private disputes. The complaint of Dalmia Group is already pending adjudication before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi, having jurisdiction to decide on the issue of forgery.  The present proceedings are meant for only the allegations made in the in Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                                         Page 16 of 68   the present SCN. In the extant SCN, the allegations are whether the act(s) of the Noticee facilitated AFSPL in execution of fraudulent transfer of MF units from the accounts of DCEL, OCL and NEPL and whether such act of the Noticee is in violation of provisions of securities laws. It may be noted even if such collusion is there, it would not unsustain the allegations of the facilitation against the Noticee. In other words the extent of allegation against the Noticee does not get nullified or diluted, if there was a collusion between employees and/ or office bearers of the Dalmia Group.  22. I note here that the allegations levelled against the employees and/ or office bearers of the Dalmia Group, at the present stage, are currently at the allegations stage. Needless to say, if any of these allegations subsequent to fact finding result into violation of the PFUTP Regulations, the same will be dealt with suitably. The same cannot be determined in these proceedings as they are not covered in the scope of the current SCN.   23. From the material available on record, I note the following chronology of events in the extant matter:  Sr. No. Date Event 1 November 14, 2017 TM-CM agreement executed between AFSPL and ISSL 2 December 06, 2017 Start of business with AFSPL 3 December 30, 2017 MF units worth Rs. 329.62 crores released by ISSL to AFSPL at the request of AFSPL, while positions of AFSPL against this collateral was outstanding 4 January 01, 2018 MF units returned by AFSPL to ISSL before start of trading 5 March 31, 2018 MF units worth Rs. 335.06 crores released by ISSL to AFSPL at the request of AFSPL, while positions of AFSPL against this collateral was outstanding 6 April 02, 2018 MF units returned by AFSPL to ISSL before start of trading 7 December 26, 2018 AFSPL sold NIFTY Option contracts in the F&O segment of NSE 8 December 27, 2018 AFSPL sold NIFTY Option contracts in the F&O segment of NSE 9 December 31, 2018 Email correspondence between AF", "Date": "2021-07-02", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Order in the matter of Alleged fraudulent transfer of mutual fund units from client accounts by Allied Financial Services Pvt.

The aforesaid IPO opened on September 27, 2011 and closed on September 29, 2011. TPL allotted 71,64,406 shares in the retail individual investors Adjudication Order in respect of Grishma Securities Private Limited along with its Directors and Compliance Officer in the matter of Tijaria Polypipes Limited Page 2 of 69  category (constituting 71.64% of the total IPO shares) and 28,36,001 shares to the Qualified Institutional Buyers (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cQIBs\\\\\\\\u201d) (constituting 28.36% of the total IPO shares). The shares of TPL were listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBSE\\\\\\\\u201d) and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNSE\\\\\\\\u201d).   2. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \"SEBI\") conducted an investigation in respect of trading in the scrip of TPL, upon observing a steep fall in the share price on the first day of listing i.e. October 14, 2011 the price of TPL in NSE, fell from the highest price of Rs 67.75 per share to Rs 16.50 per share while in BSE, it fell from the highest price of Rs 67.80 per share to Rs 16.05 per share.Pursuant to certain adverse findings, SEBI vide order dated July 31, 2013 passed under Section 11(4) read with 11B of the SEBI Act read with Regulation 11(1) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (\\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) had inter alia restrained Grishma Securities Pvt Ltd (\\\\\\\\u201cGrishma\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee No.1\\\\\\\\u201d) from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities, in its proprietary account, directly or indirectly, for a period of five years and other noticees from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities, directly or indirectly, for a period of five years. Subsequently, the competent authority had approved the initiation of adjudication proceedings against the Noticees named above, for their alleged role in the purportedly fraudulent activities in the scrip of TPL on the day of the listing of the shares and possible violations of 12A (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the SEBI Act read with Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), Regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(a), (d), (p) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003 and section 23D of the Securities Contracts Adjudication Order in respect of Grishma Securities Private Limited along with its Directors and Compliance Officer in the matter of Tijaria Polypipes Limited Page 3 of 69  Regulation Act, 1956 (\\\\\\\\u201cSCRA\\\\\\\\u201d), Regulations 26(xiii), (26(xvi) of the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cBroker Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d).

It was observed during the investigation of SEBI that an individual Shri Jivraj Zala (hereinafter referred to as \"Zala\") had traded through the Noticee No.1 in the scrip of TPL. It was further observed that Zala was a walk-in client having annual income below Rs.5 lakhs and had traded only in the scrip of TPL through the Noticee No.1. The investigation had observed that on the very first day of his trading, Zala had incurred a huge loss of Rs. 9,95,07,582 (comprising of Rs. 3,20,38,993 on BSE and Rs. 6,74,68,589 on NSE) by trading on the first day of listing of shares of TPL i.e. on October 14, 2011. The investigation had further observed that Zala had provided an exit to the QIBs at a premium to the issue price.   5. A perusal of the NSE client ledger of Zala maintained by the Noticee No.1, reflected that Rs.1,78,55,000 was received by it on October 13, 2011. It was further noted that the BSE client ledger of Zala maintained the Noticee No.1 reflected that Rs.1,87,00,000 was received it on October 13, 2011. Contrary to the same, the statement revealed that out of Rs. 1,78,55,000 shown to have been received by the Adjudication Order in respect of Grishma Securities Private Limited along with its Directors and Compliance Officer in the matter of Tijaria Polypipes Limited Page 5 of 69  Noticee No.1 in the NSE client ledger of Zala on October 13, 2011, only Rs. 8,55,000 was actually received by it on October 15, 2011 and the balance Rs. 1,70,00,000 was received by the Noticee No.1 only on October 17, 2011. Similarly, the entire amount of Rs. 1,87,00,000 shown to have been received in the BSE client ledger of the client Zala on October 13, 2011, was actually received by the Noticee No.1 only on October 17, 2011 as per its bank statement. Thus, it was prima facie observed that the Noticees had manipulated the ledger of Zala to give an impression that some funds were available in the client account of Zala with the the Noticee No.1 on the day of trading. It was also prima facie observed that the Noticees had allowed Zala to trade on the first day of listing in the scrip of TPL incurring a huge loss of approximately Rs.9,95,07,582 without collecting any funds from him towards the margin amount payable to the Exchange.  6. It was further observed during the investigation that Rs. 5,97,24,951.64 received towards the margin requirement of Zala for his trading in the scrip of TPL on October 14, 2011 at NSE, were majorly transferred from the client account of one Shri Vimal Punjiram Patel. Thus, it was prima facie observed that the Noticees had used the funds from the client account of Shri Vimal Punjiram Patel to clear the shortfall in margin requirements for the losses incurred by Zala in the scrip of TPL on October 14, 2011.  7. Further, it is also observed from the investigation that, the Noticees had used the shares of Shasun Pharmaceuticals worth around Rs. 17.22 lacs and Rs 13.53 lacs of The Noticee No.1's clients Shri Vimal Punjiram Patel and Shri Priyesh Arvind Bhatt respectively as margin for Zala. The Noticees were also observed to have used 66,697 Adjudication Order in respect of Grishma Securities Private Limited along with its Directors and Compliance Officer in the matter of Tijaria Polypipes Limited Page 6 of 69  shares of DB Realty Ltd. received from one Shri Pramod K. Goenka worth Rs. 35,91,633.45 as margin. Therefore, it was also observed that the Noticees had used securities worth over Rs. 66 lacs of their three clients for meeting the margin requirement for the losses incurred by Zala at BSE. It was also observed that the Noticees had used shares worth Rs. 2.46 crores of Shri Vimal Punjiram Patel for meeting the margin shortfall for the losses incurred by Zala at NSE.    8. It was also observed that the Noticee No.1 had used funds from its own F&O account, current account as well as it had also received funds from Mr. Mihir Ghelani, CEO & Company Secretary of the Noticee No.1 Securities Pvt. Ltd (Noticee No. 5 in the present proceedings) for meeting the margin requirements for the losses incurred by Zala in the scrip of TPL on October 14, 2011 at BSE. The details of the said transfer of funds is as follows:   Date Amount transferred to the Clearing corporation by the broker towards margin (in `) Ultimate source of funds Amount (in `) Name of the Client Account from where funds were transferred 14/10/2011 50,00,000 1,41,00,000 The Noticee No.1 Securities Pvt. Ltd.-NSE F&O Settlement A/c a/c no. 004010200405027 Axis Bank Ltd.

Ltd  a/c no. 2321600000064 with DCB 14/10/2011 10,00,000 4,52,956 and 5,34,307 Pay out received 14/10/2011 35,86,814 2,00,00,000 Mihir Ghelani  1,45,86,814    9. It was further observed that as per the statement recorded before SEBI on May 21, 2012, Shri Mihir Ghelani had mentioned that he made payments of Rs. 2 Crores and Rs. 20 Lakhs to The Noticee No.1 Intermediaries Pvt. Ltd. towards ledger debit and margin call for the trading done by him in commodities at MCX. However, it was observed that the said money was transferred from the account of the Noticee No.1 Intermediaries Pvt. Ltd. to the Noticee No.1 which was ultimately used for meeting the margin requirements for the losses incurred by Zala in the scrip of TPL on October 14, 2011.  10. Further it was also observed from the investigations that the Noticee No.1 had executed synchronized trades on behalf of Zala, few of such trades are as following:   No Name of the entity Trade Volume Order of the entity price and time Order of the noticee on behalf of Zala, price and time Exchange Time Difference between the buy and sell order 1. 2 Salasar Stock Broking Ltd 91,603 Sell order of 1,00,000 Buy order of 1,00,000 shares at BSE 4-7 seconds Adjudication Order in respect of Grishma Securities Private Limited along with its Directors and Compliance Officer in the matter of Tijaria Polypipes Limited Page 8 of 69  shares at Rs. 52 per share at 12:10:52 Rs. 52 per share at 12:10:56 1,92,384      Total = 2,83,987 Sell order of 2,82,000 shares at Rs. 50 per share at 13:28:13 Buy order of 2,00,000 shares at Rs. 50 per share at 13:28:20 2. 4 Salasar Stock Broking Ltd 2,73,794 Sell order of 3,00,000 shares at Rs. 48 per share at 12:11:33 Buy order of 5,00,000 shares at Rs. 48 per share at 12:11:36 NSE 2-3 seconds  11. The investigations had also observed that Zala did not have the risk taking capacity to take over such heavy losses. Thus, it was prima facie observed that the Noticees were acting as the focal point for executing certain modus operandi meant to facilitate exit to the QIBs and also observed to have played a catalyst role in perpetuating the fraud that was being played on the genuine investors.   SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  12. Accordingly, a show cause notice (\\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) dated August 30, 2013, was served upon the Noticees containing the allegations as already narrated in the preceding Adjudication Order in respect of Grishma Securities Private Limited along with its Directors and Compliance Officer in the matter of Tijaria Polypipes Limited Page 9 of 69  paragraphs and thereby, had allegedly violated the provisions of of Section 12A(a), 12A(b), 12A(c) and 12A(d) of the SEBI Act, Section 23D of SCRA, Regulations 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 4(1), 4(2)(a), 4(2)(d) and 4(2)(p) of the PFUTP Regulations, Regulations 26(xiii), 26(xvi), Regulation 7 of the Stock Brokers Regulations read with Clauses A(1), A(2), A(3) and A(4) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers of Schedule II, which was duly served upon the Noticees by September 3, 2013. Relevant Extract of the Investigation Report and the details of the synchronized trades executed by The Noticee No.1 on behalf of Zala were provided along with the SCN. Vide a letter dated September 13, 2013, the Noticees collectively responded to the SCN inter alia by asking for inspection of documents. The said inspection was allowed vide letter dated September 23, 2013 and the Noticees had taken the inspection thereafter.   13. Vide a letter dated December 24, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cfirst reply\\\\\\\\u201d) the Noticees had replied to the SCN, relevant extracts of which are reproduced herein below:  \\\\\\\\u201c2. At the outset, it is submitted that the initiation of the present proceedings against the Noticees is unfair, arbitrary and in violation of due process of law and no further regulatory intervention is called for in the matter. On the same cause of action and on the basis of similar allegations (as in the present SCN), SEBI had passed an Ex-Parte Ad-Interim Order dated December 28, 2011 (\"Ex-Parte Order\") restraining the Noticees from buying, selling or dealing in any securities in any manner, whatsoever. The Ex-Parte Order effectively suspended the certificate of registration of The Noticee No.1 Securities and restrained the other Noticees from accessing the capital markets.  The Ex-Parte Order was confirmed by a Confirmatory Order dated November 5, 2012 (\"Confirmatory Order\"). As a result, the Noticees have already suffered a restraint for two years. Adjudication Order in respect of Grishma Securities Private Limited along with its Directors and Compliance Officer in the matter of Tijaria Polypipes Limited Page 10 of 69  3.  Further,  SEBI  also  issued a Show  Cause  Notice dated  November  30,  2012   under Sections 11 B and 11 (4)  of the Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India Act, 1992 (\"SEBI  Act\")  and  these  proceedings  culminated  in an order  dated  July  31, 2013 (\"Final  Order\") where the harsh,  punitive and debilitating restraints  imposed vide the  Ex-Parte Order  were continued against Grishma in respect of its stock broking business  and  Grishma has  been  restrained  from  undertaking any  trades in its proprietary account for a period of five years. The individual Noticees have also been restrained from accessing the capital markets for a period of five years.  4.  Further, as you are aware, proceedings under the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 have been initiated against Grishma.  5. Therefore, it is respectfully submitted that subjecting the Noticees to adjudication proceedings for the same cause of action, when the Noticees have in any event suffered for nearly two years and have been barred from accessing the securities market for five years, besides being unwarranted is grossly disproportionate to the alleged violation. 6.  Therefore, it is submitted that no further regulatory action or monetary penalty is warranted and the proceedings may be dropped without any adverse finding or order.  Background  7. The SCN relates to the initial public offering of Tijaria Polypipes Limited (\"TPL\") between September 27, 2011 and September 29, 2011, and trades in the shares of TPL on the first of day listing on October 14, 20 II on the BSE Limited (\"BSE\") and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (\"NSE\").  8.  At the outset, it is submitted that Grishma, apart from merely acting as a broker, had no nexus whatsoever, with those traded in the shares of TPL.  Inspection incomplete  9.  At the outset, the Noticees submit that full and complete inspection has not been provided and the principles of natural justice have not been observed in the conduct Adjudication Order in respect of Grishma Securities Private Limited along with its Directors and Compliance Officer in the matter of Tijaria Polypipes Limited Page 11 of 69  of these proceedings.  For instance, SEBI   has not provided the Noticees with a complete copy of the investigation report and has provided only an extract of the same.  The   SCN   merely   annexes   an   extract   of   the   findings contained   in the Investigation report (\"IR\"). The Noticees submit that this reply is being submitted without prejudice to its right to seek full and complete inspection of all records and documents in SEB I 's possession in relation to the captioned matter.  10. The Noticees respectfully submit that the allegations in the SCN are based on an incorrect appreciation of facts and certain allegations in the SCN are patently erroneous and are contrary to the record and documents furnished by SEBI itself.  Summary of the Key Allegations against the Noticee in the SCN: 11. The SCN makes the following allegations against the Noticee:  a)   The Noticee No.1 manipulated the ledger of its client, Jivraj Zala (\"Zala\") to give an impression that some funds were available in the client account of Zala with the Noticee on October 14, 2011.  b)  The Noticees allowed Zala to trade on the first day of listing in the scrip of TPL incurring a loss of Rs 9,95,07,582 without collecting adequate funds from Zala towards meeting margin requirements for such trades.  c)   The Noticees funded Zala's margin requirements using funds and securities from third parties including   its other clients, namely, Shri Vimal  Punjiram  Patel, (\"Patel\"),  Shri   Priyesh   Arvind   Bhatt  (\"Bhatt\")  and   Shri   Pramod   Goenka (\"Goenka\").  d) Grishma used funds from its own Future and Options account (\"F & O Account\") and current account in addition to funds being received from Noticee No.4, Mr. Mihir Ghelani, CEO and Compliance Officer of Grishma for meeting Zala's margin requirements.  e)   Grishma executed synchronized trades on behalf of Zala.  12. The SCN, on the basis of the above allegations states that the actions of the Noticees are in contravention of  the provisions of Section  12A(a), 12A(b), 12A(c) and 1 2A(d) of the Adjudication Order in respect of Grishma Securities Private Limited along with its Directors and Compliance Officer in the matter of Tijaria Polypipes Limited Page 12 of 69  Securities  and  Exchange  Board of India Act, 1992 (\"SEBI Act\"),  Section 23D of the Securities  Contracts (Regulations) Act, 1956 (\"SCRA\") and Regulations  3(a), 3(b),3(c),    3(d),4(1),4(2)(a),   4(2)(d)   and   4(2)(p)    of   the   SEBI   (Prohibition   of Fraudulent  and Unfair Trade  Practices relating to the Securities Market)  Regulations, 2003 (\"PFUTP Regulations\"), Regulations  26(xiii)  and 26(xvi) and Regulation 7 of the of the Securities and  Exchange  Board of India (Stock  Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations,   1992,  (\"Stock Brokers Regulations\")  read  with  clauses  A( I),  A(2), A(3) and A(4) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers of Schedule II.    113. The IR makes a number of other unsubstantiated allegations against the Noticees including   that   Lopa Saumil Bhavnagri was a contact person of the Noticee's Ahmedabad   branch a charge   that is entirely without basis. The SCN does not expressly refer to these and certain other allegations made in the IR and therefore it is assumed that these charges are not being pressed against the Noticees.  In any event, the Noticee has answered these and other allegations made in the IR in its reply dated December 11, 2012 to the earlier Show Cause Notice dated November 30, 2012 and the contents of the same are repeated and reiterated as if the same were set out here in extenso. The Noticees crave leave to refer to and rely upon the records in the proceedings initiated against the Noticees under Sections 11 and 11B of the SEBI Act.   14. The Noticees will demonstrate with precision that none of the allegations in the SCN are tenable. The foundational charge i.e. that margin requirements of Zala was met from funds of third parties, is itself untenable and without basis. With regard to the allegation that The Noticee No.1 was the \"focal point\\\\\\\\u201d in the purported fraud played on genuine investors, is in the realm of conjecture and surmise and is not borne out by any evidence on record. In light of the facts and circumstances in this Reply, the Noticees submit that no adverse order ought to be passed and the proceedings ought to be dropped forthwith.   Noticees' Submissions  15. The Noticees submit that Grishma has not undertaken any proprietary trades in the scrip of TPL and further, that it has been made a party to the proceedings merely on account of its association in the capacity of stock broke to certain individuals who traded in the shares of TPL on the first day of listing i.e. October 14, 2011. SEBI's sweeping conclusions, seen Adjudication Order in respect of Grishma Securities Private Limited along with its Directors and Compliance Officer in the matter of Tijaria Polypipes Limited Page 13 of 69  in its Investigation Report (\"IR\"), selective portions of which have been annexed to the SCN, and in the SCN itself, that Zala and Patel are \"fronts for Grishma \" are untenable and unsupported by any evidence or material on record.  16. The Noticees submit that the allegations in the SCN are incorrect and not sustainable based on the information placed on record for the following reasons:  a) The Noticees had indeed collected adequate funds from Zala for purposes of meeting margin requirements. The cheques towards margin issued by Zala were received, deposited, realized and accounted prior to the settlement of Zala's trades, in complete compliance with the norms applicable to collection and accounting of margins and accordingly, the allegation that the Noticees manipulated the client ledger is untenable;  b) SEBI's allegation that the Noticees used funds belonging to third parties for meeting Zala's margin requirements is contrary to the facts on record, apart from being based on the demonstrably erroneous premise that the Noticees allowed Zala to trade in the scrip of TPL without posting adequate margins;  c) The transactions alluded to in the SCN and IR as evidence to show that Grishma used the funds belonging to other clients and its CEO, Noticee No.4, Mihir Ghelani, have no nexus whatsoever with Zala's trades in TPL.  No manipulation in the client ledger of Zala  17. The SCN alleges that Grishma manipulated Zala 's client ledger on the basis that the date of receipt of funds is at variance w ith the bank statements of Grishma. The SCN incorrectly states that the ledger entries incorrectly record the date of receipt of funds, whereby the amounts are shown as having been received earlier than the date on which the funds were credited to Grishma\\\\\\\\u2019s bank account.  In fact, the ledger entries indicate the date of physical receipt of the cheque and not the date on which the underlying funds were credited in the account.   18. The   recording of date of the receipt of the cheques is in accordance with the mercantile system of accounting.  Further, this is also in accordance with circulars issued by SEBI. SEBl's circular dated August 27, 2003, permits collection of margin amounts by cheque. Adjudication Order in respect of Grishma Securities Private Limited along with its Directors and Compliance Officer in the matter of Tijaria Polypipes Limited Page 14 of 69  SEBI Circular No.  MRD/SE/Cir-33/2003/27/08 dated August 27, 2003 which inter-alia prohibits brokers from accepting cash \\\\\\\\u2018'from clients whether against obligations or as margin for purchase of securities.\" and states that all payments received by brokers from clients \"strictly by account payee crossed cheque. A copy of SEBI 's circular is annexed as \"Annexure A\".  There is no obligation on in law which requires a stock broker receiving margin payments by cheque to record only the actual date of credit of funds in the client ledger as the date of receipt of margins. Such a requirement is not even envisaged by SEBI.  19. Moreover, even for transactions in the derivatives segment, where the regulatory restrictions on margins are admittedly more stringent than on the cash segment, brokers have been explicitly permitted to receive payments by cheques.  Brokers are required to record the date of receipt of the cheques in the ledger either on the date of the trade i.e. Tor on a T+1 basis notwithstanding the fact that the cheques may get cleared only subsequently.  Circulars   issued by NSE and the BSE state that the collection of margin is adequate where:       \\\\\\\\u201cCheques [are] received/recorded in the books of trading member on or before T day or T+1 day (excluding bank holiday, if any) and cleared subsequently.\"  20. The Noticee further seeks to rely on SEBI 's circular dated February 23, 2005 which allows brokers to decide the mode of collection of margin money, thereby also allowing brokers to follow a practice of collecting margin money by means of a post-dated cheque.  SEBI's circular No. MRD/DoP/SE/Ci r-07/2005 SEBI dated February 23, 2005 titled   \"Comprehensive   Risk   Management   Framework   for   the   Cash Segment\", inter-alia states that:       \"Members should have a prudent system of risk management to protect themselves from client default. Margins are likely to be an important element of such a system. The same shall be well documented and be made accessible to the clients and the Stock Exchange. However, the quantum of these margins and the form and mode of collection are left to the discretion of the members\" (Emphasis Supplied).  A copy of SEBI 's circular dated February 23, 2005 is annexed as Annexure B\". Adjudication Order in respect of Grishma Securities Private Limited along with its Directors and Compliance Officer in the matter of Tijaria Polypipes Limited Page 15 of 69  21. Admittedly, on October 13, 2011, a day prior to Zala 's trades in TPL shares, Grishma received 7 cheques for an amount of Rs. 3,65,55,500/ - (Three crores sixty-five lakhs fifty-five thousand only) and the date of receipt of the cheques was the date posted in the   ledger.  It is also not in dispute that these cheques were duly honoured. Accordingly, the question of manipulating the ledger to give a misleading impression of funds having being credited to Grishma 's bank account does not arise and the allegations in the SCN in this regard are baseless.  Margins were indeed collected from Zala  22. It is alleged in the SCN that the Noticees did not collect margin money i.e. the collateral collected in order to cover the risks associated with the trades, from Zala for the trades on October   I 4, 2011. This allegation too is wholly untenable and unsustainable for the reasons set out below.  23. As stated above, on October 13, 2011 i.e. one day prior to Zala's trades in the shares of TPL, Grishma collected seven cheques, equivalent to Rs 3,65,55,000/-. The SCN incorrectly records that out of Rs.1,78,55,000/- in Zala\\\\\\\\u2019s ledger shown to have been received on October 13, 2011, Rs 8,55,000/- was received on October 15, 2011 \"and the balance Rs. 1,70,00,000 was received by the you only on October 17, 2011\\\\\\\\u201d. This allegation is patently erroneous as is evident on a perusal of the Grishma\\\\\\\\u2019s bank account statement held with YES Bank which shows that Rs 1 ,78,55,000/- was received from Zala on October 15, 2011 itself. Similarly, the entire amount of Rs. 1 ,87,00,000/- was received and credited in the bank account of Grishma on October 17, 2011 i.e. prior to the pay in date for the trades of October 14, 2011. Thus, on October 17, 2011, a sum of Rs. 3,65,55,000/- was collected by Grishma as margin, one day prior to pay in date of Zala\\\\\\\\u2019s trades that were undertaken on October 14, 2011.  24. Further, the SCN wrongly represents that the trades undertaken by Zala in the shares of TPL were the first trades executed by Grishma as a stock broker on behalf of Zala. The IR records that Zala \"had traded only in the scrip of Tijaria through the broker prior to October 13, 2011.\" However, the factual   position is that Zala first trades were executed on October 13, 2011 in the scrip of Jain irrigation and MVL Ltd. Grishma craves leave to refer to and rely on the contract notes issued to Zala in this regard. Zala incurred a profit of around Rs. 53,169.49 on account of his trades on October 13, 2011. Further, there was a credit Adjudication Order in respect of Grishma Securities Private Limited along with its Directors and Compliance Officer in the matter of Tijaria Polypipes Limited Page 16 of 69  balance of Rs. 3,66,08,169.49 in the account of Zala as on October 13, 2011 which is before the trades of Zala on October 14, 2011.  25. In this regard, a reference is also made to the BSE Circular dated November 4, 2003, which sets a permissible limit of 25 times of the Base Minimum and Additional Capital deposited with the Exchange by the member. A copy of the circular has been annexed hereto and marked as \"Annexure C\".  Thus, before recording alleging that Grishma failed to collect adequate funds towards margin requirement for the trades executed by Zala on October 14, 2011, SEBI ought to have considered the permissible limit of exposure that Grishma as a stock broker is permitted to provide to Zala on October 14, 2011. On October 14, 2011, the maximum exposure limit at any given point of time was about 35 l akh shares of TPL. Considering an average rate of Rs. 60 per share, this limit translates into about Rs. 21 Crores. This exposure is much less than 10 times the value already collected from Zala as against the permissible limit of 25 times of the value in Zala\\\\\\\\u2019s account. The SCN has erroneously recorded that \"Zala did not have the risk taking capacity to take over such   heavy losses\"   and   such   a   conclusion   is   evidently   made   without   due consideration to the facts and the legal position stated above.  26. Thus, it has been demonstrated there had indeed been no manipulation of the client ledger as Grishma\\\\\\\\u2019s actions of recording the date of receipt of the cheque in the ledger was in accordance with the mercantile system of accounting. Further, Grishma had collected adequate funds from Zala towards the margin requirement for his trades in the shares of TPL, and consequently, the attendant allegations that the Noticees using funds and securities of third parties towards meeting the margin requirement of Zala do not stand. As is clearly set out in SEBI 's own circular of February 23, 2005, the quantum of margins, form and mode of collection are left to the discretion of brokers and accordingly, no fault can be found in the conduct of the Noticees. Grishma 's actions as a stock broker are in consonance with the objective behind margin collection, which is to ensure that margins can be utilized in the event of a default by the client.  In light of the above, it is submitted the proceedings against the Noticees must be dropped.

Securities and Exchange Board of India\\\\\\\\u2019s (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) alert system had generated front running alerts for the months of December 2019 and January 2020 against Ms. Meena Ramniklal Vira, suspected to be front running the trades of Tata Absolute Return Fund, a scheme of Tata AIF, a SEBI registered Alternative Investment Fund (\\\\\\\\u201cBig Client / BC\\\\\\\\u201d).  2. Based on the aforesaid alert, SEBI conducted a preliminary examination for the period December 1, 2019 to April 15, 2020 (\\\\\\\\u201cExamination Period\\\\\\\\u201d) to look into the possible violations of provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and various regulations framed thereunder including SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (\\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) by certain connected entities including Ms. Meena Ramniklal Vira.  SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s Examination 3. SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s preliminary examination brought out the following: 3.1. It is observed that around 99% of trades of the Big Client in value terms were executed through their broker, Reliance Securities Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cRSL\\\\\\\\u201d). At RSL, the Big Client was placing orders through the following 3 Dealers namely, Mr. Harshal__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 3 of 75  Ramnik Vira (Chief Dealer of RSL), Mr. Bhavesh Gandhi (Senior Dealer of RSL) and Mr. Abhijeet Nandkumar Jain (Deputy Dealer of RSL). 3.2. Certain entities connected with the aforesaid Dealers of RSL were prima facie observed to have traded depending on the impending orders of the Big Client on numerous occasions during different time periods during the Examination Period. Subsequently, these connected entities squared off their positions when the orders of the Big Client were placed in the market. Thus, they were able to generate substantial proceeds for themselves by placing orders in anticipation of the price movement of scrips on account of large buy / sell orders of the Big Client. Interim Order 4. In light of the aforesaid findings of the examination, an interim order dated August 7, 2020 (\\\\\\\\u201cInterim Order\\\\\\\\u201d) was passed by SEBI inter alia against Mr. Harshal Vira, Mr. Bhavesh Gandhi, Mr. Abhijeet Jain, Mr. Ketan Parekh, Mr. Anish Bagadia, Mr. Mukesh Parekh, Mr. Rutul Shah, Mr. Mukesh Jain, Ms. Meena Ramniklal Vira, Anish Pravin Bagadia HUF, Pravin Durlabhji Bagadia HUF, Ms. Falguni Ketan Parekh, Ms. Foram Bhavesh Gandhi, Mr. Dhimant Himatlal Shah, Mr. Rajesh Himmatlal Shah, Mr. Sanket Rajeshkumar Shah, Ms. Archana Mukesh Parekh, Mr. Rahul Doshi, Labdhi Enterprises and Across Broking Pvt. Ltd. (collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d). The interim order against the Noticees was passed taking into account the facts and circumstances described therein, which are, inter alia, summarised as under: 4.1. Mr. Harshal Vira, Mr. Bhavesh Gandhi and Mr. Abhijeet Jain were privy to information with respect to the impending orders of the Big Client as they were the Dealers on behalf of the Big Client for its trades. Thus, they were in possession of information of the impending trades of the Big Client which was not available in the public domain. 4.2. Based on KYC details, Call Data Records (\\\\\\\\u201cCDRs\\\\\\\\u201d), social media posts and bank statements of the Noticees, the Noticees involved in the extant matter were broadly classified under two distinct groups, namely Harshal Vira Group (\\\\\\\\u201cHV__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 4 of 75  Group\\\\\\\\u201d) and Bhavesh Gandhi Group (\\\\\\\\u201cBG Group\\\\\\\\u201d).

The trading pattern of the trades executed from the trading account of the Noticees, except the Noticees who were only information carriers (\\\\\\\\u201cIC\\\\\\\\u201d) belonging to both the groups was analysed and it showed that the trades executed from the trading account of the Noticees, except the Noticees who were only ICs, have followed a Buy-Buy-Sell (\\\\\\\\u201cBBS\\\\\\\\u201d) pattern or Sell-Sell-Buy (\\\\\\\\u201cSSB\\\\\\\\u201d) pattern around the orders of the Big Client which, as noted from their order log trade log, was done consistently during the Examination Period. 4.4.  Based on the cumulative effect of various related facts like pre-examination period trading activity of the Noticees, except the Noticees who were only ICs, common scrip days / contract days with the Big Client and proceeds generated by Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s trades during the Examination period along with the trading pattern of the Noticees, except the Noticees who were only ICs, it was prima facie concluded that the trades executed from the trading account of the Noticees, except the Noticees who were only ICs, in the equity derivative segment of the market had \\\\\\\\u2018front run\\\\\\\\u2019 the orders of the Big Client. 4.5. It was prima facie observed that the registered owners of the trading accounts are prima facie liable for the fraudulent trades. However, it was noted that there are other individuals who have also prima facie played an active role in the execution of the prima facie front running trades from the trading accounts of the Noticees who were front runners. These Noticees were Mr. Harshal Vira, Mr. Bhavesh Gandhi, Mr. Abhijeet Jain, Mr. Anish Bagadia, Ms. Falguni Ketan Parekh, Mr. Ketan Parekh, Mr. Mukesh Parekh, Mr. Rutul Shah, Ms. Foram Bhavesh Gandhi, Mr. Mukesh Jain and Mr. Rahul Doshi.

Therefore, the aforementioned Noticees were prima facie responsible for the trades executed from the trading account of the front runners.__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 7 of 75  4.6.

As a standard business practice, ABPL enters into a jobbing agreement with all jobbers engaged by it. As per clause 9 of the said agreement, a jobber shall not indulge in any malpractices or any kind of unfair market practices or such other activities that will disturb market equilibrium. 7.4.3. Mr. Rajesh Shah had approached the Noticees and claimed to have deep knowledge of jobbing and experience of over 30 years in capital markets, F&O segment.

He was therefore, engaged by ABPL as a jobber and trader in the month of March, 2020. 7.4.4. Mr. Rajesh Shah never handed back the signed jobbing agreement to ABPL. Mr. Rajesh Shah requested the Noticees to permit him to work from his home with an assurance that he will submit the signed document, post lockdown. However, currently he has turned hostile. 7.4.5.

Merely the fact of calls being placed cannot amount to the charge of front running.  7.4.8. The fund transactions with Mr. Rahul Doshi were part of loan transaction for the loan extended by Mr. Rahul Doshi to Mr. Mukesh Jain. Relevant bank statements and a copy of ledger have been submitted in support of the submission. 7.4.9.

Her son, Mr. Harshal Vira did not have access to her trading account. 7.6.2. There are various other trades also in her trading account other than the trades alleged to be front running the trades of Big Client.__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 13 of 75  This further substantiates the fact that her trades were independent of the trades of Big Client. 7.6.3. It might be a mere co-incidence that some of her trades were matched with the trades of the Big Client. As the orders or Big Client are usually large in quantity, some trades are bound to match with them. 7.6.4. With respect to the fund transfer from my account to the account of Mr. Abhijeet Jain, Ms. Foram Gandhi and Ms. Damyanti Gandhi, it is submitted that Mr. Abhijeet Jain and Mr. Bhavesh Gandhi are colleagues of her son and they were in requirement of some funds and requested her son to give some temporary loan to them.  7.6.5. She was not privy to any information of the impeding orders of the Big Client. 7.7. Mr. Harshal Vira vide his letter dated January 14, 2021 inter alia stated as follows: 7.7.1. There is no link or correlation between the alleged trades and CDRs. 7.7.2. There is not complete matching between the trades of the alleged front runners and the Big Client. 7.7.3. He was the Chief Dealer at RSL and Mr. Bhavesh Gandhi and Mr. Abhijeet Jain used to report to him. 7.7.4. None of the alleged trades that have matched with Big Client have been executed from his terminal and therefore no correlation of trades with him can be done. He has not passed any information in his possession to anyone. 7.7.5. There is no denial that he knows Mr. Anish Bagadia but this cannot lead to the inference that he has transmitted nonpublic information of impending orders of Big Client to him.__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 14 of 75  7.7.6. Mr. Ketan Parekh is known to him for some time as he is also in the securities market and being from same field they know each other. However, they used to get in touch or on a call on very few occasions. To the best of his memory, it was not even during market hours. 7.7.7. With respect to his access to the trading account of Ms. Meena Vira (his mother), it is submitted that at the time of opening the demat account of his mother, she had no mobile no. or email id because of which she would have given his details in the KYC form. It is submitted that no trades were executed by him through the account of his mother. 7.8. Labdhi Enterprises and Ms. Falguni Ketan Parekh (\\\\\\\\u201cFKP\\\\\\\\u201d) vide common letter dated January 16, 2021 inter alia stated as follows: 7.8.1. FKP is in charge of running Labdhi Enterprises, independent of her husband, Mr. Ketan Parekh (\\\\\\\\u201cKP\\\\\\\\u201d). 7.8.2. The email address and mobile no. associated with Labdhi Enterprises does not belong to KP. 7.8.3. Labdhi Enterprises traded for 16 days and 3 calls between KP and HV cannot be corelated to the 16 days of trading. The calls were not made to pass on any information in relation to the alleged front running activity. 7.8.4. SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s case is based on two facets: KP\\\\\\\\u2019s access to Labdhi Account and KP\\\\\\\\u2019s calls with Mr. Harshal Vira. Since both the prima facie findings with regard to Labdhi Enterprises are incorrect, it is submitted that FKP and Labdhi Enterprises have not violated provisions of PFUTP Regulations. 7.9.  KP vide his letter dated January 16, 2021 made submissions on the similar lines as made by Labdhi Enterprises and FKP.__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 15 of 75  7.10. Mr. Dhimant Himatlal Shah vide his letter dated January 19, 2021, inter alia made the following submissions: 7.10.1. All his trades which coincidentally matched with the trades of the Big client should be taken into account for the purpose of calculation of proceeds generated and should not be limited to only profit generating trades. 7.10.2. Out of 440 instances which were used for the purpose of calculation of proceeds generation, in 54 instances trades were not matching either in the buy side or sale side with the trades of the Big Client. Further, the amount directed to be paid fails to take into account charges such as brokerage, transaction charges, securities transaction tax etc. If the same would have been considered the amount would reduce to Rs. 1,27,53,478.79/-. 7.10.3. SEBI has in its possession various types of information and documents from third parties.  It is pertinent to note that inspection has to be provided of the record and not of whether relied on in the interim order to press charges.  7.10.4. He is active in the securities market since 1992 and has no business relationship or professional relationship with Mr. Bhavesh Gandhi or Ms. Forum Gandhi. There exists only family relationship amongst us. 7.10.5. Trades were executed based on his in-house jobbing strategy. No real time red flags were issued at the time of his trading. 7.10.6. The email id provided at the time of opening of account resembles the name of his daughter, Foram but it is wrong to presume and conclude that she has access to it or uses it. The said email id is used by his brother, Mr. Rajesh Himatlal Shah. The email id was created in 2005 which was handled by his brother as he could not handle these technology tools.__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 16 of 75  7.10.7. Ms. Foram Gandhi has a separate and distinct email id i.e., foram2506@gmail.com. Further, there is no bar on use of same email id by more than one client who belong to the same family. 7.10.8. Sharing common address with family could never be a basis to allege a connection. 7.10.9. The alleged calls cannot be presumed to have been related to share non-public price sensitive information since some of the calls were made on non-trading day and even on a trading day, the calls were made after the market hours. 7.10.10. The mobile number 99871116XX was never registered to Mr. Rutul Shah. It belongs to Mr. Sanket Shah. Accordingly, in light of the aforesaid fact, the conclusion that Mr. Rutul Shah was talking to him through that number as a dealer, falls flat. 7.10.11. For the trade in CHOLAFIN, he was drawn to the said trade as open interest and volume was continuously rising. His volume was very meagre compared to Big Client. He relies upon multiple sources of information like previous day volume, price, discussions among group of people, information available in print and electronic media etc.  7.10.12. Unless communication of non-public information is established, no allegation of front running can be made against him. 7.10.13. The increased trading activity is not because of the possession of non-public information but it is due to the opportunity presented by the market and his strategy in jobbing. 7.10.14. The fund transaction between his wife, Ms. Jyoti D Shah and Mukesh Jain HUF, is a loan transaction which is normally availed by them from time to time. The said loan was already repaid on June 8, 2020.__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 17 of 75  7.11. Ms. Foarm Gandhi vide her letter dated January 19, 2021 made submissions on similar lines as made by the Noticee at para 7.10 and inter alia made the following submissions: 7.11.1. The fund transaction was a loan given by her husband, BG to his colleague, HV and at that time there was a medical emergency related to her mother-in-law, the loan was returned by HV\\\\\\\\u2019s mother. The money is still lying in the account as due to Covid the medical treatment was put on hold. 7.11.2. Her uncle, Mr. Rajesh Shah is the proprietor of the firm, Foram Investment and Finance which is in operation since 1992 and the email id, foram2478@yahoo.co.in was created on the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s name representing the firm. She has no access or connection with the said email id. 7.11.3. Merely being spouse of BG does not tantamount to any connivance or meeting of mind. She is not aware of the trades executed by the other Noticees belonging to the BG Group. It has not been established that except her relationship with her husband, she has reiceved or passed on any information related to the alleged trades. 7.12.

In respect of  Function Financial Consultants P Ltd. (PAN: AABCF5486H)   Helpful Investment Advisory P Ltd. (PAN AACCH4303G) Address 10A, Hospital Street, 2nd Floor, Room No. 205, Kolkata -700072  In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd. (earlier known as Pearl Electronics Ltd).     BACKGROUND OF THE CASE  1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) initiated investigation into the trading/dealings in the scrip of Mystic Electronics Ltd (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Company\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018MEL\\\\\\\\u2019) regarding allegations of some entities indulging in an act of omission amounting to manipulation in the scrip price of MEL by repeatedly executing the trades in the scrip above the Last Traded Price (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cLTP\\\\\\\\u201d) during the period March 19, 2013 to March 31, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cinvestigation period\\\\\\\\u201d). It is alleged that ten Kolkata based companies/entities, including Function Financial Consultants P Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee no. 1\\\\\\\\u201d) and Helpful Investment Advisory P Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticeePage 2 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  no. 2\\\\\\\\u201d) have traded extensively in the scrip of MEL during the investigation period and for the purpose of the present proceeding, Noticee nos 1 & 2 are hereinafter also collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019.  It is alleged that the Noticees have consistently placed the orders in the scrip of MEL at prices above the LTP, which also caused substantial increase in the scrip price of MEL during the investigation period.  2. It is alleged that the ten Kolkata based entities, including the Noticees were among the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 who were observed to be linked to the two main \\\\\\\\u2018Operators\\\\\\\\u2019 viz. Shri Devesh Upadhyay and Shri Praveen Agarwal who allegedly controlled the ten \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees.  It is observed from the investigations that the above \\\\\\\\u2018Operators\\\\\\\\u2019 were also allegedly assisted by other persons namely, Shri Deepak Patwari and Shri Jagadish Purohit. Therefore, it is alleged that the trading/dealings in the scrip of MEL by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees have resulted in the violation of the provisions of Regulations 3(a) (b), (c), (d) and Regulations 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (e) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). 3. In view of the above reasons, adjudication proceedings have been initiated against the Noticees under the provisions of section 15HA of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2019).  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 4. Vide Order dated July 4, 2016, the undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter under section 15 I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAdjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions of section 15HA of the SEBI Act the aforementioned alleged violations leveled against the Noticees. Pursuant to the transfer of the undersigned to another department of SEBI, Dr. Anitha Anoop was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, vide an order dated March 18, 2019. Subsequently, in view of the transfer of Dr. Anitha Anoop, the undersignedPage 3 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, vide communique dated November 3, 2020.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  5. Show Cause Notice dated December 20, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticees under the provisions of Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against the Noticees and penalty be not imposed on them under the provisions of section  15HA of the SEBI Act for their alleged violation of the provisions of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a) and (e) of the PFUTP Regulations while trading/dealing in the scrip of MEL during the aforementioned investigation period. 6. MEL was incorporated on August 2011 under the Scheme of Demerger, which was sanctioned by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court. The Electronics Division of Nouveau Global Ventures Ltd (referred to as 'Nouveau') was demerged into Mystic Electronics Ltd (earlier known as Pearl Electronics Limited) and Mukta Agriculture Ltd.  As per the scheme of arrangement, 56.79 fully paid up equity shares of Rs. 10/- each of MEL were issued and allotted to the shareholders of Nouveau for every 100 fully paid up equity shares of Rs. 10/- each held by them in Nouveau. Accordingly, 1,05,36,248 equity shares of MEL were allotted to the shareholders of Nouveau. Subsequently, the shares of MEL were listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on March 19, 2013. It was observed that a stock split was also announced by the company during August 2014 (in the ratio of 10:1). The entire investigation period is divided into three patches wherein during the first patch, which was the pre-split period, the scrip price of MEL witnessed an increase from Rs. 5.55 on March 19, 2013 to close at Rs. 495 on August 13, 2014. During the second patch, which was the post-split period, the scrip of MEL witnessed increase from Rs. 49.5 on August 14, 2014 to close at Rs. 64 on October 13, 2014. Thereafter, during the third patch period i.e. from October 29, 2014 to March 31, 2015, the scrip price of MEL started decreasing and finally closed at Rs. 8.2 on March 31, 2015. 7. It is alleged   that   a   scheme   was   devised by MEL and its promoters, thePage 4 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  \\\\\\\\u2018operators\\\\\\\\u2019, and the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees, by allotting shares on preferential allotment basis to various entities. It is observed that MEL had made a preferential allotment of 92,30,000 shares of Rs. 10 each to 48 entities (who were not the promoters of MEL), on June 07, 2013, at a price of Rs 60.74/- per equity share and raised an amount of Rs. 56.06 crore. The shares issued through the above preferential allotment was under lock-in period till June 06, 2014 and post the lock-in period, some of the allottees in the preferential allotment sold the shares of the company and made profit. As per the findings of the investigation, preferential allotment proceeds to the tune of Rs. 23 crore was allegedly transferred by MEL to the account of the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, who then traded in the scrip during the investigation period. Investigation has brought out that the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees, who were based at Kolkata and who had traded in the scrip o f  M E L  during the investigation period had increased the scrip price of MEL by consistently placing the buy orders in the scrip at a price higher than the last traded price i.e LTP and also by absorbing the sell orders that were available in the market/system, which were placed at a higher price than the LTP. Further, the investigation brought out that once the scrip price of MEL reached the desired level, some of the preferential allottees exited at a higher price and made substantial gain. From the investigation report, it is observed that 14 entities (who were some of the allottees in the preferential allotment of MEL) sold 86,71,828 shares of MEL during the investigation period and had allegedly made profit. 8. It is alleged that the buy orders in the scrip of MEL were placed by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees with the support of the \\\\\\\\u2018operators\\\\\\\\u2019 viz. Shri Praveen Agarwal and Shri Devesh Upadhyay, which were placed at a higher price than the Last Traded Price (LTP). It is alleged that once the scrip price of MEL reached the desired level, some of the preferential allottees (i.e the 14 allottees who were allotted shares in the preferential allotment) exited by selling the shares and these allottees  allegedly made a profit of Rs. 33.9 crore. It is alleged that majority of the shares that were sold by the preferential allottees were purchased by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees. Thus, it is allegedPage 5 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  that a scheme has been devised by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees and the \\\\\\\\u2018 operators\\\\\\\\u2019, in order to book illegitimate profit/losses for the purpose of generation of bogus LTCG. In this regard, I  n o t e  that the concerned Department of SEBI i.e. IVD had also referred the matter to the Income Tax Department for appropriate examination at their end, as deemed fit. 9. I find that the SCN issued to the Noticees had returned undelivered with the remark \\\\\\\\u201cnot known\\\\\\\\u201d. In the interest of natural justice, an opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticees on July 2, 2019, vide letter dated April 30, 2019. In terms of the adjudication rules, attempt was also made to affix a copy of the SCN and the hearing notice dated April 30, 2019 at the last known address of the Noticees. However, the affixture of the notice/letters was not successful. The letters/notices therefore returned with the remark \\\\\\\\u201ccompany not found\\\\\\\\u201d. Thereafter, the email addresses of the Noticees were obtained from the website of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and an opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticees on August 18, 2020, vide email dated August 4, 2020. However, no one appeared on behalf of the Noticees on the stipulated date of hearing. Another opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticees on September 9, 2020, vide email dated August 19, 2020. Once again, no one appeared on behalf of the Noticees on the stipulated date of hearing. Thereafter, pursuant to my appointment as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, another opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticees on January 20, 2021. However, the letter/notice could not be affixed at the last known address of the Noticees and the same returned with the remark \\\\\\\\u201coffice closed\\\\\\\\u201d. Thereafter, in terms of the adjudication rules, a public notice was made in the newspapers viz. the Times of India, Kolkata edition and Bartaman on April 9, 2021 wherein the Noticees were intimated about the fact that a copy of the SCN issued to them has been uploaded on the website of SEBI and they may also appear for a personal hearing before the Adjudicating Officer on April 30, 2021. However, it is on record that no one appeared on behalf of the Noticees on the stipulated date of hearing. 10. I note that sufficient opportunities have been provided to the Noticees toPage 6 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  represent their case by way of reply to the SCN and also by way of personal hearing. However, it is a matter of record that Noticees failed to furnish their reply and also failed to appear for the personal hearing fixed on the stipulated dates despite the service of the SCN/letters through newspaper publication. In the absence of reply from the Noticees and/or their failure to make personal appearance, I am inclined to presume that the Noticees have nothing to offer in their defense and therefore, they have admitted to the allegations levelled against them in the SCN. In this context, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal vs SEBI, vide Order dated February 11, 2014 has held that \\\\\\\\u201cappellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted to the charges levelled against them in the show cause notice\\\\\\\\u201d 11. Therefore, in view of the above observations and in line with Rule 4 of the adjudication rules, I am compelled  to proceed further in the matter against the Noticees on the basis of the facts/ material available on record.   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS  12. I have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticees in the SCN and the material / documents made available during the proceeding, including the investigation report and annexures. As stated above, Noticees have neither furnished their reply to the SCN nor appeared for the personal hearing during the course of the proceeding. It is alleged that Noticees have repeatedly placed orders in the scrip of MEL at price over and above the LTP in the scrip and thereby instrumental in significantly increasing the scrip price of MEL.  13. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of the PFUTP Regulations allegedly violated by the Noticees, which are mentioned below:  3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner;Page 7 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under; (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.  4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities. (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following, namely:\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market; (e) any act or omission amounting to manipulation of the price of a scrip   14. From the material/documents made available, I find that the scrip of MEL witnessed unusual fluctuation in the price and volume during the investigation period. During investigation, it was observed that during the Patch 1 period, 28,31,939 shares were traded in the scrip of MEL with an average daily volume of 8,504 shares. The price of the scrip moved from Rs 5.55 and it touched a high of Rs 610/- on June 6, 2014 i.e. the scrip price of MEL increased by 110 times. It was observed that 10 Kolkata based companies i.e. the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 in the context of the present proceeding, which also includes the Noticees have contributed to Rs 1383.15 of the Net LTP and Rs 2491.2 of the positive market LTP in the scrip of MEL during the investigation period (i.e. patch 1), which is 88% & 89% of the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 Net LTP and positive LTP contribution. The ten Kolkata based \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees who traded significantly in the scrip of MEL during the investigation period had allegedly  placed repeated buy orders in the scrip of MEL at a price above the LTP and caused  increase in the scrip price of MEL during the investigation period.  It is alleged that the ten \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 viz.  Function Financial Consultants P Ltd i.e. Noticee no. 1, Helpful Investment Advisory P Ltd i.e. Noticee no. 2, Topwell Properties P Ltd, Manifold Vinimay P Ltd,Page 8 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  Shivkhori Construction P Ltd, Amanat Suppliers P Ltd, Lagan Dealtrade P Ltd, Limestone Properties P Ltd, Comfort Dealcom P Ltd and Mankind Vintrade P Ltd were operated by S/Shri Praveen Agarwal and Devesh Upadhyay (who, as already stated, were allegedly mentioned as the \\\\\\\\u2018operators\\\\\\\\u2019 in the investigation report). As already discussed above, the financials and fundamentals of MEL did not support the sudden increase in the scrip price of MEL. The financial results of MEL for the Financial Years ended 2013, 2014 and 2015 are as follows:   Description Year Ended (Rs. In million)  31-March 2013 31-March 2014 31-March 2015 Revenue 689.19 238.99 16.94 Expenditure -688.69 -235.83 -8.25 Net Profit 0.34 2.17 6.01 EPS (in Rs.) 0.11 0.12 0.03   15. From the above, it can be seen that the increase in the scrip price of MEL was not supported by the fundamentals as the company had registered negligible profits during the investigation period. There was also no major corporate announcement/developments that were made by the company during the investigation period other than the announcements made on financial results, preferential allotment, and the stock split. Therefore, no major corporate announcements were observed which could support such price rise in the scrip of MEL during the investigation period. 16. Based on the price movement and the stock split of MEL (10:1 ratio w.e.f. August 14, 2014), the entire investigation period was divided into three patches, details of which are as under :--Page 9 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  Patch I Pre-Stock Split Price Rise March  19,  2013  to August 13, 2014 Patch II Post Stock Split Price Rise August 14, 2014 to October 28, 2014 Patch III Price Fall October 29, 2014 to March 31, 2015   17. The price volume data in the scrip of MEL on BSE during the investigation period is as under:-  Patches Period of investigation  Open High Low Close Avg.

As already mentioned in the preceding paras, MEL had made a preferential allotment of 92,30,000 shares of Rs.10 each to 48 entities (who were not belonging to the promoter/promoter group of MEL), on June 07, 2013, at a price of Rs. 60.74/- per equity share and had raised an amount  of  Rs.  56.06 Crore. From the information provided by MEL during the course of investigation, it is observed that MEL transferred Rs. 23 crore received through the preferential allotment to various entities, details of which are mentioned as under:  Name of the entities to whom funds were transferred by MEL Operator Name Amount transferred (Rs. in crore) Wonder Procon P Ltd. Devesh Upadhyay 5 Visible Real Estate Ventures P. Ltd. Devesh Upadhyay 5Page 10 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  Blossom Dealcom P Ltd. Devesh Upadhyay 1.5 Hemlata Vinimay P Ltd. Devesh Upadhyay 1.75 PS IT Infrastructure Services Limited Sajjan Kedia 7.5 JMD Telefilms Industries Jagadish Purohit 1.5 Nouveau Global Ventures Promoter entity 0.21     19. From the records, it is observed that there were 12 promoters of MEL viz. 7 promoter entities, viz., Attribute Shares and Securities P Ltd., Forever Flourishing Finance and Investment, Golden Medows Export Limited, Kashish Multitrade P Ltd., Kasturi Overseas P Ltd., Mumbadevi Finance Invest. Co. P Ltd and Navyug Telefilms P Ltd. and 5 individual promoters, viz., Kishan Khadaria, Asha Khadaria, Mohit Khadaria, Sushila Khadaria and Mohini Khadaria. Further, from the website of MCA, it is observed that the shares of the above promoter companies were held by some unlisted entities located at Kolkata. On perusal of the directors\\\\\\\\u2019 details of these unlisted entities from the MCA website, it is observed that these entities were the outfits of the \\\\\\\\u2018 operators\\\\\\\\u2019 namely, Shri Devesh Upadhay and Shri Praveen Agarwal along with other persons viz. Shri Jagdish Purohit and Shri. Deepak Patwari. 20. I find from the investigation report that none of the entities mentioned in the Table at para 18 above (i.e entities who had allegedly received Rs 23 crores from MEL) had traded in the scrip of MEL during the investigation period. It is however alleged in the investigation report and in the SCN that the preferential allotment proceeds to the tune of Rs 23 crores have been transferred to the account of \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees, who in turn have traded in the scrip of MEL during the investigation period. In this regard, I have perused the investigation report and the annexures made available and I find that there is nothing on record, either in the investigation report or in the SCN, to corroborate the finding/observation that the above amount of Rs 23 crores which were transferred to the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees were in turn utilized by them to trade in the shares of MEL during the investigation period.Page 11 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  21. It is observed from the investigation report that Shri Devesh Upadhyay,  Shri  Praveen  Agrawal  ( i.e the \\\\\\\\u2018Operators\\\\\\\\u2019)  along  with Shri  Deepak Patwari have in their individual statement/submissions  made to the Office of Income Tax, Kolkata mentioned that they were in the business of providing accommodation entries through different \\\\\\\\u201cBogus Companies\\\\\\\\u201d under their control. It was further mentioned by the above persons in their statement   made to the IT Authorities that during the investigation period, a total of 1629 entities have traded in the scrip, out of which 90 entities were observed to be connected to them i.e connected to the  \\\\\\\\u2018operators\\\\\\\\u2019 and Shri Deepak Patwari. 22. It is also observed during the investigation that during the Patch I period, 28,31,939 shares of MEL were traded with an average daily volume of 8,500 shares. The price of the scrip moved from Rs. 5.55 and touched a high of Rs. 610 (06/06/2014) i.e. scrip price of MEL witnessed increase by 110 times. During the price rise patch, on the buy side, 60 connected entities had contributed to Rs. 2777.80 to the positive LTP as compared to the market positive LTP of Rs. 5,876. The contribution of these 60 connected entities is given below:     23. I find that the 10 Kolkata based \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees have contributed to Rs. 1,383.15 of t h e  Net LTP and Rs. 2,491.2 of the Positive Market LTP, which is 88% and 89% of the \\\\\\\\u2018 connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 Net LTP and Positive LTP contribution in the scrip of MEL. Five out of the above mentioned ten \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 were the entities/companies/outfits which were allegedly controlled by the \\\\\\\\u2018operator\\\\\\\\u2019 i.e Shri Praveen Agarwal and the other five entities/companies were allegedly operated by Shri Devesh Upadhyaya. The details of the contribution of the Top 10 \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees  in the price movement of MEL are as follows:-Page 12 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.   24. I find that during the Patch 1 period the top 10 \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees have significantly contributed towards the positive LTP of Rs. 2,491.2 (positive LTP) out of the total positive market LTP of Rs. 5,875.95 during the patch I period, which is 42% of the total positive market LTP. I find that the Noticees were the two largest contributors to the positive LTP during the investigation period, which is also evident from the data mentioned in the above Table.   25. From the investigation report and analysis carried out w.r.t LTP in the scrip of MEL, I find that the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees contributed significantly to the price rise in the scrip during the Patch I period by repeatedly placing the buy orders in the scrip of MEL at a higher price than the last traded price. I observe that the top 10 \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees had carried out 346 trades during the  patch 1 period out of which in 283 trades, the sell orders were  placed first in the scrip. I find that the  \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees then placed the buy orders and absorbed the existing sell orders and thereby increased the scrip price of MEL. It is observed during the price rise period (pre-split) that on 135 trading days (out of a total of 326 trading days), the daily average traded volume in the scrip was 750 shares and only 5 trades were carried out on an average per day in the scrip during this period. Therefore, during this period when the scrip witnessed low interest in terms of number of trades and volume traded, the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees repeatedly placed orders in MEL at a price higher than the last traded price with a view to manipulate the price of the scrip. The above trading pattern of the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees clearly showed  the manipulative intent on the part of the Noticees.Page 13 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  26. From the trading pattern, I find that the buy orders were placed by the Noticees significantly above the last traded price; the variance from the LTP was between Rs. 28.9 and Rs. 56.9, which was 7.28% and 10.3% higher than the LTP. Such trades were being executed by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 including the Noticees during the period when the average traded volume in the scrip was only 750 shares. I find that the trading of the Noticees alone had accounted for more than 60% of the positive LTP during the patch I period, which in my opinion is a significant contribution to the price rise in the scrip of MEL. In this regard, on a sample basis, few buy orders placed by Noticee nos. 1 and 2, who were the top two LTP contributors among the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, were considered and examined, details of which are mentioned as under:-    27. From the above, it can be seen that the sell orders in the scrip of MEL were coming at prices higher than the LTP first, and both Noticee nos 1 and 2 were placing the buy orders significantly above the LTP. As stated, such trades were being executed by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees during the period when the average traded volume in the scrip of MEL was only 750 shares. Therefore, from the above observations, I conclude that the trading in the scrip of MEL by the Noticees during the investigation period had a large impact on the price movement which was witnessed in the scrip during the patch I period. Further, the manner in which the Noticees consistently placed the orders in the scrip of MEL above the LTP clearly shows their malafide intentions and there were no justifications for continuously placing the orders above the LTP during patch I period.  28. As already mentioned, the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 including the Noticees were contributing to the price rise with their buy orders which were repeatedly placed above the LTP evenPage 14 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  though the fundamentals of the company did not justify such trades. Further, with the volumes being low in the scrip, the scrip was amenable to large directional moves on the strength of the orders placed by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees. In the present matter, as already mentioned, the Noticees have not filed any reply and/or made personal appearance and therefore, I have to presume and conclude that they have nothing to offer in their defense. It is observed that the trading in the scrip of MEL by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 including the Noticees increased the scrip price substantially and once the scrip price of MEL reached the desired level, the preferential allottees exited and made substantial gains. Clearly, the above trading pattern in the scrip of MEL by the Noticees by repeatedly placing the buy trades substantially above the LTP cannot be considered as a normal rational behavior and such trades were executed by the Noticees only with the intention of manipulating the scrip price of MEL.  29. I find that the trading pattern in the scrip of MEL by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees showed a concerted pattern of repeatedly placing the buy orders in the scrip at a price higher than the LTP with a view to manipulating the  scrip price of MEL. Further, it cannot be ignored that the Noticees put together were the largest contributors to the positive LTP in the scrip during the investigation period. In this context, it is pertinent to mention that Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, in the matter of Saumil Bhavnagari vs SEBI, in its order dated March 21, 2014, while discussing the trades done by the appellant at a rate higher than LTP held that \\\\\\\\u201c..Such trades undoubtedly have a potential of raising the price of the scrip by sending a wrong signal to the gullible investors about the activity or price hike in the scrip of the company.\\\\\\\\u201d 30. I also find that both Noticee no 1 and 2 shared common registered office address at 10A, Hospital Street, 2nd Floor, Room No. 205, Kolkata -700072. Both the entities were allegedly connected/operated by the same person/operator i.e Praveen Agarwal and the email address of both the entities were also the same i.e. balajibhumi@yahoo.co.in. From the website of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, it is observed that both Noticee nos 1 & 2 have common directors, viz., Shri Uday Debnath and Shri Bijay Kumar Palai and both the companies were incorporated in Kolkata on the same date i.e June 10, 2010. Therefore, it is abundantly clear that the Noticees were connected to each other and had acted in concert to repeatedly place the buy orders in the scrip at  rate higher than the LTP.Page 15 of 17 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  31. In the present matter, I also note that, in exercise of its powers conferred under sections 11(1), 11(4) & 11 B of the SEBI Act, an order dated June 26, 2020 was passed by the Whole Time Member, SEBI in the matter of MEL and 14 entities, including the Noticees, wherein, inter alia, the following observations were made:- \\\\\\\\u201cIn view of the above, I hold that the repeated buy trades substantially above the last traded price cannot be considered as a normal rational behavior and such trades were executed by the Noticees with the intention of manipulating the price of the Scrip. I, therefore, hold that the trades of the  Noticees 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in the scrip of Mystic during patch 1 would attract Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d),4(1) and 4(2)(e)of FUTP 2003.\\\\\\\\u201d 32. I observe that the Noticees have also not furnished any reply to the SCN which was issued to them in terms of the above mentioned 11(1), 11(4) and 11 B proceeding initiated against them under the SEBI Act. The Noticees also did not appear for the personal hearing before the WTM, SEBI.  I note that Noticee nos. 6 & 7 which is mentioned in the aforementioned order of WTM-SEBI are also the Noticees in the context of the present adjudication proceeding. Therefore, on the basis of independent assessment of facts and circumstances of the case and the material made available on record and the allegations levelled against the Noticees in the SCN, I am also in agreement with the conclusions drawn by the WTM, SEBI against the Noticees in the above mentioned Order. In view of the above observations, I hold that Noticees have violated the provisions of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2) (e) of the PFUTP Regulations. 33.

No Name  SEBI Registration No. 1. Saffron Capital Advisors Pvt. Ltd.

Acropetal Technologies Limited (herein after referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cATL\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cCompany\\\\\\\\u201d) came out with an Initial Public Offer (herein after referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIPO\\\\\\\\u201d) for issue of 1,88,88,889 equity shares of face value Rs.10/- each at a price of Rs. 90/- per share, aggregating to Rs. 170 Crore during February 2011. ATL was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange Limited (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange Limited (NSE) on 10/03/2011. Saffron Capital Advisors Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSaffron/Noticee\\\\\\\\u201d) was the Book Running Lead Manager (BRLM) with regard to the IPO. The bidding for the issue was open from 21/02/2011 to___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Saffron Capital Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited           Page 2 of 19  24/02/2011 and the issue was oversubscribed 1.19 times. The scrip opened at Rs. 92/- and Rs. 130/- and touched a high of Rs.140/- and Rs. 150/- on NSE and BSE respectively. 2. Securities and Exchange Board of India (herein after referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) conducted an investigation in the matter. The scope of investigation was to ascertain whether there were any violation(s) of the provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cICDR Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d)and Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCRA\\\\\\\\u201d)   3. During the investigation it was observed that Saffron was the BRLM with regard to the ATL-IPO. Hence, further investigation was carried out to ascertain the role of Merchant Banker, i.e., the Noticee w.r.t. the non-disclosures / wrong disclosures made in the prospectus of the IPO. Brief details of observations and allegation in the investigation report (hereinafter referred to as (\\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Report/IR\\\\\\\\u201d) are as follows: 3.1. ATL has availed a Bridge Loan facility of Rs. 20 crore from United Bank of India for meeting expenses forming part of the objects of the issue and certified by the statutory auditor, M/s K. Gopalakrishnan & Co, Chartered Accountants that it was utilized till 21/01/2011, for advance towards construction of building of Rs.7.00 Cr and working capital of Rs.13.00Cr. However, on analysis of the bank statement of ATL the utilization of bridge loan Rs. 20 crore was as follows: Details Amount (Rs. Crore) approx.) Equastone Properties 7.00 Crystal Euphoria, Hongkong (in US $)    4.64 Acropetal  (in US $) 4.40___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Saffron Capital Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited           Page 3 of 19  Optech Consulting \\\\\\\\u2013  (in US $)                 2.78 Payment to subsidiaries  0.55 Other (cash withdrawal etc ) 0.63 Total 20.00 3.2. It was observed that Ms. Malini Reddy (Malini), wife of Promoter & CMD of ATL Shri Ravikumar, was the major promoter of M/s Equastone Properties Pvt Ltd (Equastone) and was holding 90% shareholding and other directors were employees of ATL (Prashanth Kumar and Madhava Reddy). From the KYC details of Equastone submitted by UBI, it was observed that the authorized signatory to the bank accounts of Equastone was Shri D Vedavyasa Rao, Head- Accounts of ATL. 3.3. Equastone being an entity promoted by Ms. Malini Reddy (Malini) i.e. wife of Promoter & Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) Mr. Ravikumar and also in promoter group of ATL was related entity of ATL and also the employees of ATL (viz. Prashanth Kumar and Madhava Reddy) were the directors in Equastone. Therefore Equastone being related party, the transaction of transfer of 7 crores to Equastone, being a related party transaction was not disclosed by ATL in its prospectus. ATL, vide its letter dated 02/05/2016, had informed that said amount of Rs.7 crore was transferred to Equastone as advance towards construction of software development center. ATL has further submitted that subsequently said project was cancelled and ATL received back the advance paid to Equastone.  3.4. It was observed that had Saffron independently verified the background of Equastone, even by accessing publically available information (like MCA database or any other such means), it would have known about the connection of Ravikumar/wife of Shri Ravikumar and Equastone. Thus, Saffron, as BRLM to the public issue of ATL has failed to do independent verification. 3.5. Further, it was observed that the remaining Rs.13 crore was transferred to abroad companies, for which no reason whatsoever could be provided by ATL. Hence, it___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Saffron Capital Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited           Page 4 of 19  was observed that entire transaction was not genuine and disclosure as appearing in the prospectus was false 3.6. In view of the above it was alleged that, Noticee has failed to exercise due diligence to ensure the veracity and adequacy of disclosure made in the prospectus as required under Regulation 64(1) of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009 and had also failed to perform its duties as mentioned under various clauses of Code of Conduct for Merchant Bankers specified under Schedule III in SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992.  4. In light of the above, SEBI initiated enquiry proceedings against the BRLM of IPO viz. Saffron Capital Advisors Private Limited as prescribed under Regulation 27 of Intermediaries Regulations, 2008, for the alleged violations of Regulation 60(7)(a) and Regulation 64(1) of SEBI  (Issue of Capital Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cICDR\\\\\\\\u201d), Regulation 13 read with Clause 1,2,3,4,6,7  and 20 of the Code of Conduct for Merchant Bankers specified in Schedule III in SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cMerchant Banker Regulation\\\\\\\\u201d). Designated Authority (DA) was appointed   to inquire and adjudge   the alleged violations and to conduct an enquiry with respect to dealings of Saffron Capital Advisors Private Limited as a BRLM/Merchant Banker, in the matter of IPO of ATL.   5. After concluding the enquiry and taking into consideration the facts and  circumstances of the case, in terms of Regulation 27 of SEBI Intermediaries Regulation, DA vide its Report dated December 11, 2020, found that, the Noticee has failed in due diligence and independent professional judgment on the veracity and adequacy of the disclosure in the prospectus with respect to the Related Party Transaction and the utilization of the bridge loan and thus found non-disclosure/wrong disclosure in the prospectus and recommended that the violation___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Saffron Capital Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited           Page 5 of 19  of the Noticee may be visited with the action of prohibiting Noticee to take any new assignment for the period of 15 days.  6. Pursuant to this, a post enquiry Show Cause Notice (P-SCN) dated January 21, 2021 was issued to the Noticee, under Regulation 28 (1) of SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008, to show cause as to why action, as recommended by the DA or any other action as considered appropriate should not be taken against the Noticee. A copy of the DA\\\\\\\\u2019s Report was also forwarded to the Noticee along with an advice to file reply, if any, within 21 days from the date of receipt of the notice.  7. Subsequently in response to the P-SCN, Noticee vide letter dated February 18,2021, made the following main submission: 7.1. Noticee was the BRLM to the IPO of ATL and submitted the due diligence certificate. 7.2. With reference to the observation on wrong disclosure/non-disclosure made in the prospectus, Noticee has carried out due diligence meticulously and thoroughly as per requirement set out in year 2010 and assured of no non-disclosure or wrong disclosure in the offer document. 7.3. Noticee denies the allegation of transaction for transfer of Rs. 13 crores were not genuine and mentioned that they received certificate from M/s K. Gopalkrishnan & Co., statutory auditor of ATL that, company has utilized bridge loan availed from UBI to pay advance towards construction of building of Rs. 7 crores and working capital of Rs. 13 crores. Noticee has no reason to question auditor\\\\\\\\u2019s certificate. Further, utilization statement of bridge loan did not raise suspicion as Equastone was one of the suppliers for building contract and ATL was 100% export oriented unit and working capital payment would be to meet the expenses at these centres as almost 100% revenue is earned from export and hence it was natural that funds were remitted abroad as working capital. The same has been___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Saffron Capital Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited           Page 6 of 19  classified as working capital by the auditor in the statement of deployment. The Noticee has made reference to Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT order in the matter of corporate strategic alliance vs. SEBI where Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT held that, \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026The balance sheet has been duly audited by the statutory auditor and accepted by the Income Tax Authority. It is not open to the AO to question the entries in the balance sheet. The AO is not an expert to judge the accounting figures and hold as to which entry should come under \\\\\\\\u201cFixed Assets\\\\\\\\u201d or under \\\\\\\\u201cRevenue Expenditure\\\\\\\\u201d. The Merchant Banker has only disclosed what the balance sheet was showing for which purpose the Merchant Banker cannot be found at fault\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d. Have stated the facts corroborated with the disclosures in annual report for the previous 5 years. 7.4. Ms. Malini Reddy, spouse of Mr. Ravikumar (Managing Director of ATL) was not director of ATL during the issue tenure. Since she was neither director nor the promoter of the company and only part of Promoter group, hence there was no ground to take her DIN or verify further. In the absence of DIN no data can be procured from MCA website and impossible to know which company she is associated as it relates to year 2010, therefore, Equastone is related party through Ms. Malini Reddy wife of Managing Director of ATL could not have been established by any independent verification. Also the annual report and auditor certificate in the prospectus have not brought out Equastone as related party. The Noticee has made reference to the Order WTM/MPB/EFD-1-DRA-IV/67/2019 dated September 27, 2019, wherein it is stated that\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.Moreover, no material has been brought on record to show that why the transaction with Equastone would have raised red flags for the Directors especially when the money was transferred to Equastone\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d The Board Minutes or any other document that was available for verification did not contain Equastone as related party to make any further enquires. Issuer Company being primarily responsible for the disclosure of related party and related party transactions and, also the fact___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Saffron Capital Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited           Page 7 of 19  that statutory auditor, being the auditor since incorporation of ATL in April 2001, did not disclose Equastone as related party in financial statements, Noticee believed it was beyond reasonable diligence to suspect that Equastone was related party. 7.5. Noticee submitted that, Equastone appeared only as a top ten shareholder holding 3% equity of ATL on a pre-Issue capital and since the holding was less than 5%, no further enquiries about this entity was made, as further enquiries are made only in respect of significant shareholders in the company. Equastone did not meet the criteria as it held only 3% equity of ATL (pre-Issue basis).   7.6. Due Diligence certificate was submitted, Noticee conducted all verification of records and performed duties as mandated in the code of conduct for merchant banker with utmost integrity and honesty and therefore denied the allegations. Noticee has made all efforts to provide material and true information to the investors and since there was no requirement to probe further, have not asked for any additional information. 7.7. Merchant Banker cannot be expected to verify facts and information beyond a reasonable means and it is already confirmed in the DA report that Noticee has verified minute books, annual report, declaration of promoters and statement of auditors associated with ATL since incorporation. 7.8. The Noticee has denied the parlance drawn in the DA Report with reference to Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT order in the matter of Keynote Corporate Services Limited on merchant banker responsibility, as the utilization of bridge loan was disclosed in the prospectus and there was no material to suggest that Equastone was related party, in Minutes of Board Meeting, Annual Report and Statutory Auditor\\\\\\\\u2019s reports, related party disclosures, declaration / submissions / undertakings by ATL and its management/KMPs..___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Saffron Capital Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited           Page 8 of 19  7.9. Noticee has mentioned that its positions has been vindicated, as the expert on whose certificate the BRLM is supposed to rely on as per the established position and market practice/custom, turned out to be wrongly given / inaccurate / incorrect, in the investigation by SEBI post IPO. Hence Noticee neither provided any wrong disclosure nor made any non-disclosure in offer document. Further, as additional due diligence Noticee insisted the deployment certificate by the statutory auditor, whereas the regulation mentions certificate from any Chartered Accountant. 7.10. Noticee has submitted that it has exercised due diligence and not violated any regulations. Further ever since it has obtained the merchant banker license in year 2008, has not been involved in any adjudication proceedings or matter involving serious offences/frauds and no penalties have been imposed for any such matters. 7.11. The Noticee denied all the violations against it and has requested not to prohibit them from taking new assignment for a period of 15 days as recommended by DA. Findings and consideration 8. Based on the facts, discussions and material available on record and the submissions of the Noticee, the DA has found that the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 60(7)(a) and 64(1) of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009 and  Regulation 13 read with Clause 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 & 20 of  Code of Conduct for Merchant Bankers specified under Schedule III in SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992. DA has recommended that the Noticee may be prohibited to take any new assignment for the period of 15 days. 9. I have considered the report submitted by the DA, the P-SCN issued to the Noticee, oral and written submissions of the Noticee along with the documents___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Saffron Capital Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited           Page 9 of 19  contained therein and other material available on record. I note that the issue that arises for consideration in the present matter is whether there was failure by BRLM to do independent professional judgment and due diligence for the non-disclosure and wrong disclosure in the prospectus with respect to related party transaction and utilization of the issue proceeds towards working capital requirement, in the prospectus of ATL.  10. I note that the Noticee has vehemently contested all observations brought out in the Enquiry Report by the DA and denied all the allegations against the Noticee. 11. In order to proceed further, it is relevant to reproduce the applicable provisions as below: ICDR Regulations  60. Public communications, publicity materials, advertisements and research reports.

Ltd. in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited           Page 12 of 19  12. In view of the above, it is noted here that, Regulation 60(7) of ICDR Regulations makes it obligatory on the issuer to not issue any advertisement or research that is not true, fair and it should not be manipulative or deceptive or distorted. Schedule VIII clearly indicates that the means and sources of financing including details of bridge loan and related party transactions have to be disclosed in the Prospectus. Further, Clause (IX)(B)(12) (a)(v) Part A of Schedule VIII of ICDR Regulations, places the onus on Issuer to make disclosure of related party transactions. However, even though the onus is on the issuer company to make the disclosure, Regulation  64 of ICDR Regulation mandates the BRLM/Merchant Banker that it, shall  exercise  due  diligence  and  satisfy  himself  about  all  the aspects of the issue including the veracity and adequacy of disclosure in the offer documents.   Related Party Transaction Disclosure 13. As per ICDR Regulations, Issuer Company shall disclose transaction with related party in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standard (AS 18) in the prospectus as per Part A of Schedule VIII IX (B) (12) which brings out that information with respect to transactions or loans between the issuer with an enterprises in which a substantial interest in the voting power is owned, directly or indirectly by any person (close members of such individuals\\\\\\\\u2019 families),  over which such a person is able to exercise significant influence and includes enterprises owned by directors or major shareholders of the issuer.  14. It was also noted form the MCA website, it was noted that Ms. Malini Reddy, wife of Promoter/CMD of ATL, Shri Ravikumar, and also in the promoter group of ATL, was the major Promoter of Equastone and was holding 90% shareholding and additionally other Directors were also employees of ATL, namely Shri Prashanth Kumar and Shri Madhava Reddy. From the KYC details of Equastone submitted___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Saffron Capital Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited           Page 13 of 19  by United Bank of India, it was observed that the authorized signatory to the bank accounts of Equastone was Shri D Vedavyasa Rao, Head- Accounts \\\\\\\\u2013ATL. At the investigation stage, Ms. Malini Reddy was advised to confirm her role in Equastone. She had submitted that in November, 2006, she had resigned as the Director of Equastone and transferred the entire shareholding in Equastone to Shri Prashanth Kumar. She had also submitted a copy of Annual Return of Equastone for the year 2007 which she claimed to have filed with MCA showing transfer of shares of Equastone in favour of Shri Prashanth Kumar. However, it is observed from the MCA website that the said filing was done only on July 25, 2011. Therefore the contention of Ms. Malini Singh on the transfer of the share during 2007 is not acceptable. I also note that, as per disclosure in the prospectus in Annexure 18, Ms. Malini Reddy was related party to ATL in the capacity as Promoter Group (Immediate Relative of promoter/CMD).   15. In view of the above facts, Equastone is a related entity of ATL / Shri Ravikumar as wife of Shri Ravikumar was the majority shareholder in Equastone. Therefore, it is held that fund transactions with Equastone is Related Party Transaction, which was not disclosed by ATL in its Prospectus. Additionally, it was also noted that employees of ATL (viz. Shri Prashanth Kumar and Shri Madhava Reddy) were the Directors in Equastone during the period 2010-11.  16. The Noticee has submitted that, Ms. Malini Reddy was not a director of Acropetal when the issue was being handled / DRHP was being prepared / RHP was filed with the ROC and SEBI. Noticee was informed that she is more a housewife and never takes part in any company activities. Since she was not a director or a promoter of the company and she was only part of promoter group, that too because of definition under the ICDR Regulations, 2009, hence there was no ground to take her DIN Number or verify further. In the absence of a DIN no data can be procured from the MCA Website and it is impossible to know the companies___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Saffron Capital Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited           Page 14 of 19  with which she was associated, as the MCA website was different during 2010. I note that the Noticee has also contented that, it made 5 level of due diligence through verifying Annual Report for 5 years, Minutes of the Board Meeting for 5 years, Statutory Auditor\\\\\\\\u2019s Certificate/Statement and declaration of management of ATL and promoter and promoters group, where no reference or disclosure of RPT with Equastone was made nor any material or circumstance was on record to raise any red flag. Noticee has also submitted that as Equastone was only appearing as top 10 shareholder with 3% on pre-issue capital and since the holding was less than 5% no further inquiries was made. 17. At this stage, it needs to be further seen whether any redflag was there to indicate failure of due diligence to detect that Equastone is a related party at the relevant point of time.  18. Apart from the due diligence through Annual Report for 5 years, Minutes of the Board Meeting for 5 years, Statutory Auditor\\\\\\\\u2019s Certificate/Statement and declaration of management of ATL and promoter and promoters group, Noticee has also submitted the interest certificate of Mr. D. Ravi Kumar under section 299 of the companies Act 1956, obtained during the due diligence. I note that section 299 of the Companies Act 1956 mandate \\\\\\\\u201cProcedure, etc., where director interested\\\\\\\\u201d containing \\\\\\\\u201cDisclosure of Interests by Director\\\\\\\\u201d which read as, Every director of a company who is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, concerned or interested in a contract or arrangement, or proposed contract or arrangement, entered into or to be entered into, by or on behalf of the company, shall disclose the nature of his concern or interest at a meeting of the Board of Directors. Further section 297 of the Companies Act 1956 requires to obtain Board's sanction to be required for certain contracts in which particular directors are interested mentioning that, Except with the consent of the Board of Directors of a company, a director of the company or his relative, a firm in which such a director or relative___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Saffron Capital Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited           Page 15 of 19  is a partner, any other partner in such a firm, or a private company of which the director is a member or director, shall not enter into any contract with the company - (a) for the sale, purchase or supply of any goods, materials or services. However, as per the interest certificate given by Mr D. Ravi Kumar for FY ending 31/03/2010 to the Board of Directors of the Company, no declaration of Equastone as interested entity through Ms. Malini Reddy was made. 19. The Declaration dated March 10, 2010 and February 25, 2011 Mr. D Ravi Kumar has declared that, \\\\\\\\u201cI am not interested in any loan or advance given by the Company to any Person(s)/ Company(ies) nor am I beneficiary of any loan or advance. 20. Further Mr. D Ravi Kumar vide declaration dated February 25, 2011 to the Noticee has given an undertaking which inter-alia contains the following: 20.1. Save as stated in the Prospectus, neither I nor any person forming part of Promoter Group, nor any of my relatives nor any of Directors of our Company nor any of the group companies are directly or indirectly deemed to be interested in any of the 'Objects of the Issue' as stated in the Prospectus in what so ever nature and in whatsoever capacity.  20.2. Save as stated in the Prospectus, neither I nor any person forming part of Promoter Group, nor any of my relatives nor any of Directors of our Company nor any of the group companies are directly or indirectly deemed to be interested in any of transactions executed with Debtors or Suppliers of the Company. 21. Based on the above facts it is noted that Mr. D Ravi Kumar has deliberately concealed the details of Equastone as related entity and Ms. Malini Reddy connection to the Equastone. Further based on the above there are no red flags___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Saffron Capital Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited           Page 16 of 19  raised for the Noticee to further delve into statements on the related entities and related party transactions. Wrong Disclosure on Utilisation of 13 Crores from the Bridge Loan 22. Regarding transaction for transfer of Rs. 13 crores it is alleged that, if the Noticee had played a pro-active role by looking into authenticity of audited fund deployed statement and the bank statements, Noticee would have known that, the said amount was in fact transferred to companies abroad and is non-genuine. I note here that except, lapse / flaw in the process of independent judgment by the Appellant, there is no allegation of any collusion of the Appellant with the Issuer Company or Auditor. Noticee in this respect has submitted that they received certificate from M/s K. Gopalkrishnan & Co., statutory auditor of ATL that, company has utilized bridge loan availed from UBI to pay working capital of Rs. 13 crores and Noticee has no red-flags to question auditor\\\\\\\\u2019s certificate. At this stage, it needs to be seen whether any red flags existed for the transfer of Rs.13 crore to abroad companies as not genuine and therefore the disclosure as appearing in the prospectus in this respect was false. In this regard, perusal of the prospectus shows that ATL has disclosed that the working capital requirement is majorly towards sundry debtors, other current asset and creditors and provisions. Therefore, given the statement by the ATL and Auditor in the prospectus enumerating the purpose for which working capital is needed, it is difficult to conclude on preponderance of probability basis, that there existed red flags on t", "Date": "2021-06-29", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Final Order in respect of Saffron Capital Advisors Private Limited in the matter of Acropetal Technologies Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jun-2021/final-order-in-respect-of-saffron-capital-advisors-private-limited-in-the-matter-of-acropetal-technologies-limited_50774.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 64048, "unique_record_id": "ebc517b0dcSEBI20210629", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6682710d7858910306473580", "parse_date": "2024-07-01 09:03:40", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Disclosure Failings", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "No financial penalties are mentioned in the article.", "gpt_audience": "1.

Avenue, 9th Floor, Kolkata- 700012  In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd (earlier known as Pearl Electronics Ltd).     BACKGROUND OF THE CASE  1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) initiated investigation into the trading/dealings in the scrip of Mystic Electronics Ltd (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Company\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018MEL\\\\\\\\u2019) regarding allegations of some entities indulging in an act of omission amounting to manipulation in the scrip price of MEL by repeatedly executing the trades in the scrip above the Last Traded Price (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cLTP\\\\\\\\u201d) during the period March 19, 2013 to March 31, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cinvestigation period\\\\\\\\u201d). It is alleged that ten Kolkata based companies/entities, including Topwell Properties P Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee no. 1\\\\\\\\u201d), ShivkhoriPage 2 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  Construction P Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee no. 2\\\\\\\\u201d), Limestone Properties P Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee no. 3\\\\\\\\u201d) and Comfort Dealcom P Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee no. 4\\\\\\\\u201d) have traded extensively in the scrip of MEL during the investigation period and for the purpose of the present proceeding, Noticee nos 1, 2, 3 & 4 are hereinafter also collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019.  It is alleged that the Noticees have consistently placed the orders in the scrip of MEL at prices above the LTP, which also caused substantial increase in the scrip price of MEL during the investigation period.  2. It is alleged that the ten Kolkata based entities, including the Noticees were among the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 who were observed to be linked to the two main \\\\\\\\u2018operators\\\\\\\\u2019 viz. Shri Devesh Upadhyay and Shri Praveen Agarwal who allegedly controlled the ten entities, including the Noticees.  It is observed from the investigations that the above \\\\\\\\u2018Operators\\\\\\\\u2019 were also allegedly assisted by other persons namely, Shri Deepak Patwari and Shri Jagadish Purohit. Therefore, it is alleged that the trading/dealings in the scrip of MEL by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees have resulted in the violation of the provisions of Regulations 3(a) (b), (c), (d) and Regulations 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (e) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). 3. In view of the above reasons, adjudication proceedings have been initiated against the Noticees under the provisions of section 15HA of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2019).  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 4. Vide Order dated July 4, 2016, the undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter under section 15 I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAdjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions of section 15HA of the SEBI Act the aforementioned alleged violations leveled against the Noticees. Pursuant to the transfer of the undersigned to another department of SEBI, Dr. Anitha Anoop was appointedPage 3 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, vide an order dated March 18, 2019. Subsequently, in view of the transfer of Dr. Anitha Anoop, the undersigned was once again appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, vide communique dated November 3, 2020.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  5. Show Cause Notice dated December 20, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticees under the provisions of Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against the Noticees and penalty be not imposed on them under the provisions of section  15HA of the SEBI Act for their alleged violation of the provisions of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a) and (e) of the PFUTP Regulations while trading/dealing in the scrip of MEL during the above mentioned investigation period. 6. MEL was incorporated on August 2011 under the Scheme of Demerger, which was sanctioned by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court. The Electronics Division of Nouveau Global Ventures Ltd (referred to as 'Nouveau') was demerged into Mystic Electronics Ltd (earlier known as Pearl Electronics Limited) and Mukta Agriculture Ltd.  As per the scheme of arrangement, 56.79 fully paid up equity shares of Rs. 10/- each of MEL were issued and allotted to the shareholders of Nouveau for every 100 fully paid up equity shares of Rs. 10/- each held by them in Nouveau. Accordingly, 1,05,36,248 equity shares of MEL were allotted to the shareholders of Nouveau. Subsequently, the shares of MEL were listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on March 19, 2013. It was observed that a stock split was also announced by the company during August 2014 (in the ratio of 10:1). The entire investigation period is divided into three patches wherein during the first patch, which was the pre-split period, the scrip price of MEL witnessed an increase from Rs. 5.55 on March 19, 2013 to close at Rs. 495 on August 13, 2014. During the second patch, which was the post-split period, the scrip of MEL witnessed increase from Rs. 49.5 on August 14, 2014 to close at Rs. 64 on October 13, 2014. Thereafter, during the third patch period i.e. from October 29, 2014 to March 31, 2015, the scrip pricePage 4 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  of MEL started declining and finally closed at Rs. 8.2 on March 31, 2015. 7. It is alleged   that   a   scheme   was   devised by MEL and its promoters, the \\\\\\\\u2018operators\\\\\\\\u2019, and the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees, by allotting the shares of MEL on preferential allotment basis to various entities. It is noted that MEL had made a preferential allotment of 92,30,000 shares of Rs. 10 each to 48 entities (who were not the promoters of MEL), on June 07, 2013, at a price of Rs 60.74/- per equity share and raised an amount of Rs. 56.06 crore. The shares issued through the above preferential allotment was under lock-in period till June 06, 2014 and post the lock-in period, some of the allottees in the preferential allotment sold the shares of the company and made profit. As per the findings of the investigation, preferential allotment proceeds to the tune of Rs. 23 crore was allegedly transferred by MEL to the account of the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 who then traded in the scrip during the investigation period. Investigation has brought out that the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees, who were based at Kolkata and who had traded in the scrip o f  MEL during the investigation period had increased the scrip price of MEL by consistently placing the buy orders in the scrip at a price higher than the last traded price i.e LTP and also by absorbing the sell orders that were available in the market/system, which were placed at a higher price than the LTP. Further, the investigation brought out that once the scrip price of MEL reached the desired level, some of the preferential allottees exited at a higher price and made substantial gain. From the investigation report, it is observed that 14 entities (who were some of the allottees in the preferential allotment of MEL) sold 86,71,828 shares of MEL during the investigation period and had allegedly made profit. Pursuant to the investigations, it is alleged that the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees have increased the scrip price of MEL by repeatedly placing the buy orders in the scrip at a price higher than the last traded price and also by absorbing the sell orders in MEL that were available in the market. 8. It is alleged that the buy orders in the scrip of MEL were placed by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees with the support of the \\\\\\\\u2018operators\\\\\\\\u2019 viz. Shri Praveen Agarwal and Shri Devesh Upadhyay, which were placed at a higher pricePage 5 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  than the Last Traded Price (LTP). It is alleged that once the scrip price of MEL reached the desired level, some of the preferential allottees (i.e the 14 allottees who were allotted shares in the preferential allotment) exited by selling the shares and these allottees allegedly made a profit of Rs. 33.9 crore. It is alleged that majority of the shares that were sold by the preferential allottees were purchased by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees. Thus, it is alleged that a scheme has been devised by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees and the \\\\\\\\u2018 operators\\\\\\\\u2019, in order to book illegitimate profit/losses for the purpose of generation of bogus LTCG. In this regard, I  observe that the  concerned Department of SEBI i.e IVD had also referred the matter to the Income Tax Department for appropriate examination at their end, as deemed fit. 9. I find that the SCN issued to the Noticees had returned undelivered with the remark \\\\\\\\u201cnot known/ not found\\\\\\\\u201d. In the interest of natural justice, an opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticees on July 2, 2019 (for Noticee no. 2) and July 3, 2019 (for Noticee no. 4), vide letter dated April 30, 2019. The letter was served on Noticee no. 1, 2, 3. However, no one appeared on behalf of the Noticees on the scheduled date of hearing. In terms of the adjudication rules, attempt was also made to affix a copy of the SCN and the hearing notice dated April 30, 2019 at the last known address of Noticee no. 4. However, the affixture of the notice/letters was not successful. The letters/notices returned with the remark \\\\\\\\u201ccompany not found\\\\\\\\u201d. Thereafter, the  email addresses of the Noticees were obtained from the website of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and an opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticees on August 19, 2020 (Noticee no. 4), vide email dated August 4, 2020. However, no one appeared on behalf of the Noticees on the stipulated date of hearing.  10. Another opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticees on September 9, 2020 (for Noticee nos. 2 and 3) and September 10, 2020 (for Noticee nos. 1 and 4), vide email dated August 19, 2020. Once again, no one appeared on behalf of the Noticees on the stipulated date of hearing. Thereafter, pursuant to my appointment as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, another opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticees on January 20,Page 6 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  2021 (for Noticee no. 1) and January 21, 2021 (for Noticee nos. 2, 3, 4). However, the letter/notice could not be affixed at the last known address of the Noticees. Thereafter, in terms of the adjudication rules, a public notice was issued in the newspapers viz. the Times of India, Kolkata edition and Bartaman on April 9, 2021 wherein the Noticees were intimated about the fact that a copy of the SCN issued to them has been uploaded on the website of SEBI and they may also appear for a personal hearing before the Adjudicating Officer on April 30, 2021. However, it is on record that no one appeared on behalf of the Noticees on the stipulated date of hearing. 11. I note that sufficient opportunities have been provided to the Noticees to represent their case by way of reply to the SCN and also by way of personal hearing. However, it is a matter of record that Noticees failed to furnish their reply and also failed to appear for the personal hearing fixed on the stipulated dates despite the service of the SCN/letters through newspaper publication. Therefore, in the absence of reply from the Noticees and/or their failure to make personal appearance, I am inclined to presume that the Noticees have nothing to offer in their defense and therefore, they have admitted to the allegations levelled against them in the SCN. In this context, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal vs SEBI, vide Order dated February 11, 2014 held that \\\\\\\\u201cappellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted to the charges levelled against them in the show cause notice\\\\\\\\u201d 12. Therefore, in view of the above observations and in line with Rule 4 of the adjudication rules, I am compelled to proceed further in the matter against the Noticees on the basis of the facts/ material available on record.   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS  13. I have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticees in the SCN and the material / documents made available during the proceeding, including the investigation report and annexures. As stated above, Noticees have neitherPage 7 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  furnished their reply to the SCN nor appeared for the personal hearing during the course of the proceeding. It is alleged that Noticees have repeatedly placed orders in the scrip of MEL at price over and above the LTP in the scrip and thereby they were instrumental in significantly increasing the scrip price of MEL.  14. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of the PFUTP Regulations allegedly violated by the Noticees, which are mentioned below:  3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under; (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.  4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities. (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following, namely:\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market; (e) any act or omission amounting to manipulation of the price of a scrip   15. From the material/documents made available, I find that the scrip of MEL witnessed unusual fluctuation in the price and volume during the investigation period. During the investigation, it was observed that during the Patch 1 period, 28,31,939 shares were traded in the scrip of MEL with an average daily volume of 8,504 shares. The price of the scrip moved from Rs 5.55 and it touched a high of Rs 610/- on June 6, 2014 i.e the scrip price of MEL increased by 110 times. It was observed that 10 Kolkata based companies i.e the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019Page 8 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  in the context of the present proceeding, which also includes the Noticees have contributed to Rs 1383.15 of the Net LTP and Rs 2491.2 of the positive market LTP in the scrip of MEL during the investigation period (i.e patch 1), which is 88% & 89% of the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 Net LTP and positive LTP contribution. The ten Kolkata based \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees who traded significantly in the scrip of  MEL during the investigation period have allegedly placed repeated buy orders in the scrip of MEL at a price above the LTP and caused substantial increase in the scrip price of MEL during the investigation period.  It is alleged that the ten \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 viz.  Function Financial Consultants P Ltd, Helpful Investment Advisory P Ltd, Topwell Properties P Ltd i.e Noticee no. 1, Manifold Vinimay P Ltd, Shivkhori Construction P Ltd i.e Noticee no. 2, Amanat Suppliers P Ltd, Lagan Dealtrade P Ltd, Limestone Properties P Ltd i.e Noticee no. 3, Comfort Dealcom P Ltd i.e Noticee no. 4 and Mankind Vintrade P Ltd were operated by S/Shri Praveen Agarwal and Devesh Upadhyay (who, as already stated, were allegedly mentioned as the \\\\\\\\u2018operators\\\\\\\\u2019 in the investigation report). As already discussed above, the financials and fundamentals of MEL did not support the sudden increase in the scrip price of MEL. The financial results of MEL for the Financial Years ended 2013, 2014 and 2015 are as follows:   Description Year Ended (Rs. In million)  31-March 2013 31-March 2014 31-March 2015 Revenue 689.19 238.99 16.94 Expenditure -688.69 -235.83 -8.25 Net Profit 0.34 2.17 6.01 EPS (in Rs.) 0.11 0.12 0.03   16. From the above, it can be seen that the increase in the scrip price of MEL was not supported by the fundamentals as the company had registered negligible profits during the investigation period. There was also no major corporatePage 9 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  announcement/developments that were made by the company during the investigation period other than the announcements made on financial results, preferential allotment, and the stock split. Therefore, no major corporate announcements were observed which could support such price rise in the scrip of MEL during the investigation period. 17. Based on the price movement and the stock split of MEL (10:1 ratio w.e.f. August 14, 2014), the entire investigation period was divided into three patches, details of which are as under :--   Patch I Pre-Stock Split Price Rise March  19,  2013  to August 13, 2014 Patch II Post Stock Split Price Rise August 14, 2014 to October 28, 2014 Patch III Price Fall October 29, 2014 to March 31, 2015   18. The price volume data in the scrip of MEL on BSE during the investigation period is as under:-   Patches Period of investigation  Open High Low Close Avg. Vol. I \\\\\\\\u2013 Price 19/03/2013 Price 5.55 610 5.55 495 8504 Rise pepperiod- Pre \\\\\\\\u2013 Volume 1 121875 1 5138 Split 13/08/2014 II \\\\\\\\u2013 Price 14/08/2014 Price 49.5 68.2 40.9 64 220448 Rise- Post \\\\\\\\u2013 Volume 200 477250 20 31201 Split 28/10/2014 III \\\\\\\\u2013 Price 29/10/2014 Price 67.95 68 8.2 8.2 313355 Fall \\\\\\\\u2013 Volume 139806 4330100 1 43204 31/03/2015  19. As already mentioned in the preceding paras, MEL had made a preferential allotment of 92,30,000 shares of Rs.10 each to 48 entities (who were notPage 10 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  belonging to the promoter/promoter group of MEL), on June 07, 2013, at a price of Rs. 60.74/- per equity share and had raised an  amount  of  Rs.  56.06 Crore. From the information provided by MEL during the course of investigation, it is observed that MEL transferred Rs. 23 crore received through the preferential allotment to various entities, details of which are mentioned as under:  Name of the entities to whom funds were transferred by MEL Operator Name Amount transferred (Rs. in crore) Wonder Procon P Ltd. Devesh Upadhyay 5 Visible Real Estate Ventures P. Ltd. Devesh Upadhyay 5 Blossom Dealcom P Ltd. Devesh Upadhyay 1.5 Hemlata Vinimay P Ltd. Devesh Upadhyay 1.75 PS IT Infrastructure Services Limited Sajjan Kedia 7.5 JMD Telefilms Industries Jagadish Purohit 1.5 Nouveau Global Ventures Promoter entity 0.21     20. From the records, it is observed that there were 12 promoters of MEL viz. 7 promoter entities, viz., Attribute Shares and Securities P Ltd., Forever Flourishing Finance and Investment, Golden Medows Export Limited, Kashish Multitrade P Ltd., Kasturi Overseas P Ltd., Mumbadevi Finance Invest. Co. P Ltd and Navyug Telefilms P Ltd. and 5 individual promoters, viz., Kishan Khadaria, Asha Khadaria, Mohit Khadaria, Sushila Khadaria and Mohini Khadaria. Further, from the website of MCA, it is observed that the shares of the above promoter companies were held by some unlisted entities located at Kolkata. On perusal of the director details of these unlisted entities from the MCA website, it is observed that these entities were the outfits of the \\\\\\\\u2018 operators\\\\\\\\u2019 namely, Shri Devesh Upadhay and Shri Praveen Agarwal along with other persons viz. Shri Jagdish Purohit and Shri. Deepak Patwari . 21. I find from the investigation report that none of the entities mentioned in the Table atPage 11 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  para 19 above (i.e entities who had allegedly received Rs 23 crores from MEL) had traded in the scrip of MEL during the investigation period. It is however alleged in the investigation report and in the  SCN that the preferential allotment proceeds to the tune of Rs 23 crores have been transferred to the account of  \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees, who in turn have traded in the scrip of MEL during the investigation period. In this regard, I have perused the investigation report and the annexures made available and I find that there is nothing on record, either in the investigation report or in the SCN, to corroborate the finding/observation that the above amount of Rs 23 crores which were transferred to the account of the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees were in turn utilized by them to trade in the shares of MEL during the investigation period. 22. It is observed from the investigation report that Shri Devesh Upadhyay,  Shri  Praveen  Agrawal  ( i.e the \\\\\\\\u2018Operators\\\\\\\\u2019)  along  with Shri  Deepak Patwari have in their individual statement/submissions  made to the Office of Income Tax, Kolkata mentioned that they were in the business of providing accommodation entries through different \\\\\\\\u201cBogus Companies\\\\\\\\u201d under their control. It was further mentioned by the above persons in their statement made to the IT Authorities that during the investigation period, a total of 1629 entities have traded in the scrip, out of which 90 entities were observed to be connected to them i.e connected to the  \\\\\\\\u2018operators\\\\\\\\u2019 and Shri Deepak Patwari. 23. It is also observed during the investigation that during the Patch I period, 28,31,939 shares of MEL were traded with an average daily volume of 8,500 shares. The scrip price of MEL moved from Rs. 5.55 and touched a high of Rs. 610 (06/06/2014) i.e. scrip price of MEL witnessed increase by 110 times. During the price rise patch, on the buy side, 60 connected entities had contributed to Rs. 2777.80 to the positive LTP as compared to the market positive LTP of Rs. 5,876. The contribution of these 60 connected entities is given below:Page 12 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  24. I find that the 10 Kolkata based \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees have contributed to Rs. 1,383.15 of the Net LTP and Rs. 2,491.2 of the Positive Market LTP, which is 88% and 89% of the \\\\\\\\u2018 connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 Net LTP and Positive LTP contribution in the scrip of MEL. Five out of the above mentioned ten \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 were the entities/companies/outfits which were allegedly controlled by the \\\\\\\\u2018operator\\\\\\\\u2019 i.e Shri Praveen Agarwal and the other five entities/companies were allegedly operated by Shri Devesh Upadhyaya. The details of the contribution of the Top 10 \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees  in the price movement of MEL are mentioned as under :-  25. I find that during the Patch 1 period, the scrip price of MEL witnessed substantial movement from Rs. 5.55 and it touched a high of Rs. 610 (06/06/2014) i.e. the scrip price of MEL increased by 110 times during this period. The top 10 \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees have significantly contributed towards the positive LTP of Rs. 2,491.2 (positive LTP) out of the total positive market LTP of Rs. 5,875.95 during the patch I period, which is 42.41% of the total positive market LTP. I find that the Noticees were among the largest contributors to the positive LTP during the investigation period, which is also evident from the data mentioned in the above Table. For example, in 62 trades, Noticee no. 1 contributed to 7.65% of positive LTP to total market positive LTP; in 29 trades, Noticee no. 2 contributed to 1.75% of the positive LTP to total market positive LTP; in 18 trades, Noticee no. 3 contributed to positive LTP resulting in 1.77% of the positive LTP to total market positive LTP and in 11 trades Noticee no. 4 contributed to 10.8% of positive LTP to total market positive LTP. While it is noted that the 10Page 13 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 including the Noticees contributed to 42.41% of the total market positive LTP during the investigation period, it is observed that the contribution of the Noticees alone was 28.22% of the total positive contribution of the ten \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019. 26. From the investigation report and the analysis carried out w.r.t LTP in the scrip of MEL, I find that the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees contributed significantly to the price rise in the scrip during the Patch I period by repeatedly placing the buy orders in the scrip of MEL at a higher price than the last traded price. I observe that the top 10 \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees  had carried out 346 trades during the  patch 1 period out of which in 283 trades, the sell orders were  placed first in the scrip. I find that the  \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees then placed the buy orders and absorbed the existing sell orders and thereby increased the scrip price of MEL. It is observed during the price rise period (pre-split) that on 135 trading days (out of a total of 326 trading days), the daily average volume in the scrip was 750 shares and only 5 trades were carried out on an average per day in the scrip during this period. Therefore, during this period when the scrip witnessed low interest in terms of number of trades and volume traded, the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees  repeatedly placed orders in MEL at a price higher than the last traded price with a view to manipulate the price of the scrip. The above trading pattern of the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees clearly shows the manipulative intent on the part of the Noticees.  27. From the trading pattern, I find that the buy orders were being placed by the connected entities significantly above the last traded price; the variance from the LTP was between Rs. 28.9 and Rs. 56.9, which was 7.28% and 10.3% higher than the LTP. Such trades were being executed by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 including the Noticees during the period when the average traded volume in the scrip was only 750 shares.  28. It is observed from the trading pattern that the sell orders in the scrip of MEL were coming at prices higher than the LTP first, and Noticees were placing the buy orders significantly above the LTP. As stated above, such trades were being executed by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees during the period when the average traded volume in the scrip of MEL was only 750 shares. Therefore, I conclude that the trading in the scrip of MEL by the Noticees during the investigation period had a large impact on the pricePage 14 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  movement which was witnessed in the scrip during the patch I period. Further, the manner in which the Noticees consistently placed the orders in the scrip of MEL above the LTP clearly shows their malafide intentions and there were no justifications for continuously placing the orders above the LTP during the patch I period.  29. As already mentioned, the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees were contributing to the price rise with their buy orders which were repeatedly placed above the LTP even though the fundamentals of the company did not justify such trades. Further, with the volumes being low in the scrip, the scrip was amenable to large directional moves on the strength of the orders placed by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019, including the Noticees. In the instant matter, as already mentioned, the Noticees have not filed any reply and/or made personal appearance and therefore, I have to presume and conclude that they have nothing to offer in their defense. It is observed that the trading in the scrip of MEL by the \\\\\\\\u2018connected entities\\\\\\\\u2019 including the Noticees increased the scrip price substantially  and once the scrip price of MEL reached the desired level, the preferential allottees exited and made substantial gains. Clearly, the above trading pattern in the scrip of MEL by the Noticees by repeatedly placing the buy trades substantially above the LTP cannot be considered as a normal rational behavior and such trades were executed by the Noticees only with the intention of manipulating the scrip price of MEL.  30. I find that the trading pattern in the scrip of MEL by the Noticees showed a concerted pattern of repeatedly placing the buy orders in the scrip at a price higher than the LTP with a view to manipulate the  scrip price of MEL. Further, it cannot be ignored that the Noticees put together were among the largest contributors to the positive LTP in the scrip during the investigation period, details of which are already discussed in para 25. In this context, it is pertinent to mention that Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, in the matter of Saumil Bhavnagari vs SEBI, in its order dated March 21, 2014, while discussing the trades done by the appellant at a rate higher than LTP held that  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..Such trades undoubtedly have a potential of raising the price of the scrip by sending a wrong signal to the gullible investors about the activity or price hike in the scrip of the company.\\\\\\\\u201d 31. I also observe that Noticee nos.  1, 2 and 3 shared common registered office address at 33, C.R. Avenue, 9th Floor, Kolkata 700012. The 3 entities were allegedlyPage 15 of 18 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Ltd.  connected/operated by the same person/operator i.e Praveen Agarwal and the email address of Noticee no. 1 and 2 were also the same i.e. sunnight01@yahoo.co.in. From the website of Ministry of Corporate Affairs, it is observed that Shri Devi Prasad Pal is a common director on the Board of Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 3 and Shri Chiranjit Mahanta is a director on the Board of Noticee nos. 1 and 3. I observe that Noticee nos 1, 2 and 3 were incorporated in Kolkata and Noticee nos. 1 and 2 were in fact incorporated on the same date i.e August 10, 2010. Therefore, it is abundantly clear that the Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 3 were connected to each other and had acted in concert by repeatedly placing the buy orders in the scrip of MEL at a rate higher than the LTP.  As regards Noticee no. 4, it is observed that the said entity was operated by Shri Devesh Upadhyay. From the trading pattern, it is observed that Noticee no 4 had also adopted the same modus operandi followed by other Noticees i.e Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 3 by placing buy orders at a rate higher th", "Date": "2021-06-29", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Adjudication order in respect of Topwell Properties P Ltd., Shivkhori Construction P Ltd., Limestone Properties P Ltd. and Comfort Dealcom P Ltd. in the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders-that-could-not-be-served/jun-2021/adjudication-order-in-respect-of-topwell-properties-p-ltd-shivkhori-construction-p-ltd-limestone-properties-p-ltd-and-comfort-dealcom-p-ltd-in-the-matter-of-mystic-electronics-limited_51570.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 64047, "unique_record_id": "fe37f01637SEBI20210629", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "668270ec785891030647357e", "parse_date": "2024-07-01 09:02:57", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "There are no financial penalties mentioned in the provided text.", "gpt_audience": "1.

In respect of: Noticee No.  Name of the entity PAN No. 1. Profitsaim (Proprietor Mr. Syed Ayaz) FHCPS5667F  1. The present proceedings have emanated from an ex-parte ad-interim order cum show cause notice dated November 12, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe interim order\\\\\\\\u201d) passed by Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) against Profitsaim and its sole proprietor Syed Ayaz (hereinafter collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticees\\\\\\\\u201d), as the unregistered investment advisory activities of the Noticees were found to be in violation of the provisions of Section 12(1) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) and Regulation 3(1) of SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations, 2013\\\\\\\\u201d). By the interim order, following directions were issued against the Noticees:  \\\\\\\\u201c27. In view of the above, pending conclusion of enquiry, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me by virtue of Section 19 read with Sections 11, 11(4), 11B(1) and 11D read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992, hereby issue by way of this interim ex-parte order, the following directions:     27.1 Profitsaim and its Proprietor Mr. Syed Ayaz (PAN: FHCPS5667F) are directed to:    27.1.1 Cease and desist from acting as an investment advisor including the activity of acting and representing through any media (physical or digital) as an investment advisor, directly or indirectly, and cease to solicit or undertake such activity or any other activities in the securities market, directly or indirectly, in any matter whatsoever, until further orders. Final Order in the matter of Profitsaim and its Proprietor Mr. Syed Ayaz Page 2 of 11  27.1.2 Not to divert any funds raised from investors, kept in bank account(s) and/or in their custody until further orders.  27.1.3 Not to dispose of or alienate any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge on any of such assets held in their name, including money lying in bank accounts except with the prior permission of SEBI.  27.1.4 Immediately withdraw and remove all advertisements, representations, literatures, brochures, materials, publications, documents, communications etc., physical or digital in relation to their investment advisory activity or any other unregistered activity in the securities market until further orders.  27.1.5 Not to access the securities market and buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, until further orders.  27.1.6 To provide a full inventory of all assets held in their name, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge on any of such assets, including details of all bank accounts, demat accounts and mutual fund investments, immediately but not later than 5 working days from the date of receipt of this order. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d  2. Interim order also gave liberty to the Noticees to contest the findings in the interim order if they so desire and file the objections and/or request for personal hearing, if any, receivable by SEBI within 21 (twenty-one) days from the date of serving of the interim order on them. The interim order was also in the nature of a show cause notice whereby the Noticees were called upon to show cause as to why the investment advisory plans floated by them should not be held as \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advisory Services\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of the IA Regulations, 2013 and thereby the activities of the Noticees be treated as unregistered investment advisory activities and why appropriate directions, under Sections 11, 11(4), 11B(1) and 11D of the SEBI Act, 1992 and relevant SEBI Rules/Regulations, including directions to prohibit them from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities market, either directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, for a particular period, directions not to be associated with any registered intermediary/ listed entity in the securities market, in any manner whatsoever, and direction to refund the amount collected from the investors/ clients for its various schemes, should not be issued against them under Sections 11 and 11B (1) of SEBI Act, 1992. The interim order was delivered to M/s. Profitsaim and Mr. Syed Ayaz on November 17, 2020. Vide their reply which was received by SEBI on December 1, 2020, the Noticees have raised the following contentions to the interim order:  i. That the complainant Mr. Nitesh Jain (Prop. ProfitAim Research) and his Final Order in the matter of Profitsaim and its Proprietor Mr. Syed Ayaz Page 3 of 11  website name and style is \\\\\\\\u201cprofitmresearch.com\\\\\\\\u201d, but my firm name is profitsaim and the website is \\\\\\\\u201cprofitsaim.com\\\\\\\\u201d, so my firm is not related with the complainant\\\\\\\\u2019s company/ firm so the complaint logged against my firm is otherwise bad-in-law and fact as well.  ii. The fact is that my firm name and style is \\\\\\\\u201cProfitsaim\\\\\\\\u201d registered under Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises on December 4, 2019, but your honour\\\\\\\\u2019s observation in para 5(c), in the year of 2013. I started my business from December 2019, when I also received the notice from the SEBI Banglore Local Office on June 1, 2020. I stopped my business running from third party company gateway received a sum of Rs. 13,57,949/-, so the claim which is reflected in the order is false and fabricated. My firm runs business only six months, after six months when SEBI Banglore Local Office issued a notice to me, I closed my business.   iii. I am not aware about the settled principle of law regarding SEBI for the purpose of running stock advisory. Now, I am interested to register my firm with SEBI.  iv. That I want to continue the business if you will allow me and I will apply for SEBI registration and further undertake to abide by the rules and regulations framed by SEBI.   3. An opportunity of hearing was provided to the Noticees on May 28, 2021 when Mr. Syed Ayaz appeared and made his submissions on the lines of his aforesaid reply.   4. I find that the interim order passed in the matter contained following observations with respect to the Noticees: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.. 5.1 The following claims are noted from the archived pages of the website of Profitsaim:    (a) Profitsaim provides Indian Stock Market Tips \\\\\\\\u2026...

Further, as confirmed by DBS Bank, the said savings account was opened digitally through the application of the bank and hence, there is no account opening form. However, from the AOF submitted by Razorpay, it is observed that the Business Name is \\\\\\\\u201cProfitsaim\\\\\\\\u201d, while the Business Category and Subcategory are \\\\\\\\u201cFinancial Services\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cFinancial and Investment Act\\\\\\\\u201d, respectively.    5.5 The following information is gathered from the bank account and payment gateway statements(s):    Account  Number  & Bank  Period for which bank  statement is  obtained  Total Credits  (Rs.)

Mr. Syed Ayaz has contended that in the complaint referred in the interim order, the complainant - Mr. Nitesh Jain is proprietor of ProfitAim Research and the name of his website is \"profitmresearch.com\", whereas the name of the firm of Mr. Ayaz is profitsaim and his website is \"profitsaim.com\", therefore, his firm is not related with the complainant's company/ firm and the complaint against his firm is otherwise bad-in-law and fact as well. In this regard, I note that complaint Final Order in the matter of Profitsaim and its Proprietor Mr. Syed Ayaz Page 6 of 11  received from Mr. Nitesh Jain, Proprietor of ProfitAim Research was only a starting point for undertaking examining of the matter by the complainant. I note that interim order has not been passed against the Noticees for misusing the name of ProftAim Research, rather, the interim has been passed against the Noticees as their activities, as recorded in the interim order, were prima facie found to be in violation of the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and IA Regulations, 2013. Therefore, the contention raised by the Noticees, in this regard are misplaced and hence, not tenable.  6. I note that the Noticees have not disputed the observations made in the interim order, as reproduced in para 4 above, including the fact that the services offered on http://profitsaim.com were subscribed by payment through payment gateway services offered by Razorpay and the funds after settlement from the payment gateway used to be credited into the DBS Bank Account of Mr. Syed Ayaz. I note that the Noticees have also not disputed the finding of the interim order that Mr. Syed Ayaz is the proprietor of Profitsaim and he used to maintain and mange the website URL http://profitsaim.com. Rather, I find that the Noticees have acknowledged that they used to offer investment advisory services and claimed that they were ignorant of the fact that such activities as carried out by them would require previous registration from SEBI and compliance with the IA Regulations, 2013. I note that the Noticees have also expressed their willingness to subject themselves to the existing regulatory purview of SEBI and seek registration as an Investment Advisor prospectively.   7. I note that the definition of investment adviser, as given in Regulation 2(1) (m) of IA Regulations, 2013, provides that investment adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Regulation 2(1)(l) of the IA Regulations, 2013 defines investment advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d Final Order in the matter of Profitsaim and its Proprietor Mr. Syed Ayaz Page 7 of 11   8. I note that Noticees on their website i.e. www.profitsaim.com inter alia represented, \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.Profitsaim.com has firmly settled itself as one of the most significant platforms for Analysts particularly technical analysts of Indian share market. It is one of the few sites providing research and information on Indian capital markets chiefly based on Technical Analysts... We specially deals in Indian Share Market NiftyTips, Intraday Tips, Stock Tips, Trading Tips, Nifty Option, Nifty Future and Stock Option\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d. On the said website, Noticees also represented, \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..Profitsaim provides Indian Stock Market Tips by applying their technical knowledge in each & every stock via High Priority SMS Server\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d. From the details of various packages offered on the said website of the Noticees, I find that Noticees were providing services to clients in Stock Cash, Stock Future, Stock Option, Index Future, Index Option, Bullions, Base Metals and Energy. From the allegations made in the interim order and my findings recorded above, I find that Mr. Syed Ayaz was the sole proprietor of \\\\\\\\u2018Profitsaim\\\\\\\\u2019. Therefore, I find that \\\\\\\\u2018Profitsaim\\\\\\\\u2019 which is sole proprietorship concern of Mr. Syed Ayaz was engaged in giving advice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, through its website www.profitsaim.com. I find that these services were being offered by the Noticees in lieu of the consideration which could be paid by the investor concerned through the payment gateway link provided on the website and the money from the payment gateway post settlement used to be credited into the DBS Bank Saving A/c. No. 881033238562 of Mr. Syed Ayaz. As mentioned in the interim, as per the bank account statement of DBS Bank Saving A/c. No. 881033238562 of Mr. Syed Ayaz, I find that around Rs. 33,74,351/- have been credited during the period from September 24, 2019 to November 2, 2020. In view of this, I find that Noticees were providing the investment advice, in lieu of consideration. In terms of Regulation 2(1)(l) of IA Regulations, 2013 such an advice is \\\\\\\\u201cinvestment advice\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Noticees were engaged in the business of providing investment advice to public, for consideration and were thus, acting as an investment adviser, as defined under Regulation 2(1)(m) of the IA Regulations, 2013.   9. Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 provides as under: Final Order in the matter of Profitsaim and its Proprietor Mr. Syed Ayaz Page 8 of 11   \\\\\\\\u201c12(1).  No stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d  10. In order to protect the interest of investors and to maintain integrity of the securities market, IA Regulations, 2013 provides safeguards to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected. One such safeguard is that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to obtain registration from SEBI as required under Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013. Regulation 3(1) provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of IA Regulations. Further, safeguards provided under IA Regulations, 2013 includes continued minimum professional qualification and net-worth requirement for investment adviser, disclosure of all conflict of interest, prohibition on entering into transactions which are contrary to advice given for 15 days, risk profiling of investors, maintaining documented process for selecting investment for client based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s objective and risk profile, understanding the nature and risks of products or assets selected for clients, etc.   11. The activities of the Noticees, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that the Noticees were holding themselves out and acting as an investment adviser. However, it is noted that the Noticees is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of Investment Advisor. Hence, I find that these activities/ representations as being made by the Noticees without holding the certificate of registration as investment adviser are in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013.  12. I note that the material available on record does not indicate the exact amount of Final Order in the matter of Profitsaim and its Proprietor Mr. Syed Ayaz Page 9 of 11  fees collected by the Noticees, as  a  result  of  providing  investment  advice  to investors,  in  violation  of  the  provisions  of  the  IA  Regulations, 2013.  However, interim order records Rs. 33,74,351/- have been credited in the DBS Bank Saving A/c. No. 881033238562 of Mr. Syed Ayaz (which was linked to the payment gateway Razorpay on the website of Profitsaim) during the period from September 24, 2019 to November 2, 2020.   13. In  view  of  the  foregoing,  I,  in  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  upon  me  under Sections 11, 11(4),11B(1) and 11D, read with of Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992, and in supersession of the directions in the interim order, hereby direct that:  (i) The Noticees shall within a period of three months from the date of coming into force of this order, refund the money received from the clients/ investors, as fees or consideration or  in  any  other  form,  in  respect  of  their  unregistered  investment  advisory activities;  (ii) The Noticees shall issue public notice in all editions of two National Dailies (one  English  and  one  Hindi)  and  in  one  local  daily  with  wide  circulation, detailing the modalities for refund, including the details of contact person such as names, addresses and contact details, within 15 days of coming into force of this order;  (iii) The repayments to the clients/investors shall be effected only through Bank Demand Draft or Pay Order or electronic fund transfer or through any other appropriate  banking  channels,  which  ensures  audit  trails  to  identify  the beneficiaries of repayments;  (iv) The Noticees are prevented from selling their assets, properties and holding of mutual funds/shares/securities held by them in demat and physical form except for the sole purpose of making the refunds as directed above.

The direction for refund, as given in paragraph 13(i) above, does not preclude the clients/investors to pursue the other legal remedies available to them under any other law, against the Noticees for refund of money or deficiency in service before any appropriate forum of competent jurisdiction.   15. Further, the complainant is at liberty to approach appropriate forum/authorities for any alleged misuse of his trade name by the Noticees. In this regard, a reference may be made to the order dated April 06, 2021 passed by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in IL&FS Securities Services Ltd. Vs. SEBI wherein it was held that,-   \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.Further, the main function of a Tribunal is to adjudicate the disputes between the parties and, on the other hand SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s main function is not to adjudicate disputes between the parties\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  16.

In respect of:  Noticee No.  Name of the entity PAN No. 1. Equity Mania Financial Advisory (Prop: Mr Ankit Goel) AUQPG5385A    1. The present proceedings have emanated from an ex-parte ad-interim order cum show cause notice dated December 14, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe interim order\\\\\\\\u201d) passed by Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d)  inter alia against Equity Mania Financial Advisory and its sole proprietor Shri Ankit Goel, (hereinafter collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticees\\\\\\\\u201d), as the unregistered investment advisory activities of the Noticees were found to be in violation of the provisions of Section 12(1) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) and Regulation 3(1) of SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations, 2013\\\\\\\\u201d). By the interim order, following directions were issued against the Noticees:  21.1.1 Cease and desist from acting as an investment advisor including the activity of acting and representing through any media (physical or digital) as an investment advisor, directly or indirectly, and cease to solicit or undertake such activity or any other activities in the securities market, directly or indirectly, in any matter whatsoever, until further orders.Final Order against Equity Mania Financial Advisory (Prop: Mr Ankit Goel) Page 2 of 14  21.1.2 Not to divert any funds raised from investors, kept in bank accounts and/or in their custody until further orders. 21.1.3 Not to dispose of or alienate any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge on any of such assets held in their name, including money lying in bank accounts except with the prior permission of SEBI. 21.1.4 Immediately withdraw and remove all advertisements, representations, literatures, brochures, materials, publications, documents, communications etc., physical or digital in relation to their investment advisory activity or any other unregistered activity in the securities market until further orders. 21.1.5 Not to access the securities market and buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, until further orders. 21.1.6 To provide a full inventory of all assets held in their name, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge on any of such assets, including details of all bank accounts, demat accounts and mutual fund investments, immediately but not later than 5 working days from the date of receipt of this order. 21.1.7 To submit the number and details of clients who have availed their investment advisory services and to submit details of fees collected from each such client, immediately but not later than 5 working days from the date of receipt of this order.  21.2  If Equity Mania Financial Advisory or its proprietor have any open positions in any exchange traded derivative contracts, as on the date of the order, they can close out/ square off such open positions within 3 months from the date of order or at the expiry of such contracts, whichever is earlier.

The interim order was also in the nature of a show cause notice wherein the Noticees were provided with the opportunity to file their objections/reply, if any, within 21 days from the date of the interim order and were also provided with an opportunity of personal hearing before SEBI, on a date and time to be fixed on a specific request to be made by the Noticees, in that regard. In this regard, I note that the Noticees vide letter dated December 31, 2020 filed their reply to the SCN. The matter was then placed before me on March 08, 2021 and following the principles of natural justice, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticees on June 10, 2021. On June 10, 2021, Mr. Ankit Goel appeared before me via video conferencing and made his submissions. The Noticee vide his letter dated December 31, 2020 has inter alia made the following submissions:  a. I have stopped from acting as an advisor since March 2009 and I would not continue to do so. b. All the funds in the account will not be moved. No assets or money in the accounts will be moved. All advertisements have been removed. All the derivative positions are closed. c. I agree that because of my unruly and reckless behaviour I had not registered myself with SEBI and I deeply regret that. I also understand that I have been unjust to the laws pertaining to it and therefore, would completely follow all the SEBI Guidelines moving forward. d. I would also say in the span of three years I have been completely honest and reliable to all the clients that I have acquired and served them to the best of my ability. I have completely stopped giving all the services from the moment the notice was received from you.  e. All the earnings have been put into getting my office space in order and also living in the expensive city i.e. Bangalore. I would like to bring to your attention that I have given the best service possible to all the clients andFinal Order against Equity Mania Financial Advisory (Prop: Mr Ankit Goel) Page 4 of 14  there have been no complaints from any of the clients. I have been true to all the guys that have paid and have not committed any fraud by any means. f. With respect to point 10 of the report, the collected amount by the firm i.e. 42,96,283 and as mentioned in the statement that it is 48,52,941/-, the same is because of the amount that is being reversed in the account. Also the remaining difference is because of the fact that Payu money and insto mojo charges a service fee of 2.36% and this puts us at the exact value we have received.  3. I find that the interim order passed in the matter contained following observations with respect to the Noticees:  (i) SEBI received a complaint against Equity Mania Financial Advisory alleging that it is providing advisory services without obtaining registration from SEBI. In view of the complaint received, SEBI carried out a preliminary examination to ascertain whether unregistered investment advisory activities are being carried out by Equity Mania Financial Advisory.  (ii) SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s preliminary examination found that from a general internet search of the particulars of hosting of the website of the firm based on its domain name, shows that prima facie the website of the firm, www.equitymania.com, was hosted for the first time on December 2, 2016 as available on https://who.is/whois/equitymania.com. Further, in response to SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s query with respect to the initiation of business activity of investment advisory by the firm sought vide letter dated August 18, 2020, the firm has submitted vide its undated letter (received by SEBI on August 25, 2020) that it has started the said business activity in the month of December, 2016.

I note that the definition of investment adviser, as given in Regulation 2(1)(m) of IA Regulations, 2013, provides that investment adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Regulation 2(1) (l) of the IA Regulations defines investment advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d   5. I note that Noticees on their website i.e. www.equitymania.com advertised Equity Mania Financial Advisory as an investment adviser giving advice in equity and commodity market. The website page mentioned that it not only provided effective and accurate tips for investment in Equity & Commodity Market but also acts as an investment advisor as they have several other investment plans including short-term investment plans, medium-term investment plans as well as long-term investment plans. I note that as per its website pricing of some of the services offered by the firm are as under: Category Services 1 month 3 months 6 months 1 year 2 year Investment Services Long Term Investment - - - 25,000 35,000 Short Term Investment - 25,000 40,000 70,000 - Medium Term Investment - 20,000 30,000 50,000 - Trading Services Intraday services Intraday Cash Tips 7,000 15,000 25,000 35,000 - Intraday Future Tips 10,000 25,000 45,000 85,000 -Final Order against Equity Mania Financial Advisory (Prop: Mr Ankit Goel) Page 9 of 14  Intraday Option Tips 7,000 15,000 25,000 35,000 - Positional services Positional Stock Cash Tips 10,000 25,000 40,000 70,000 - Positional Future Tips 15,000 40,000 75,000 1,25,000 - Positional Option Tips 12,000 25,000 40,000 50,000 -  6. I find that these services were being offered by the Noticees in lieu of the consideration which could be paid by the investor concerned in the ICICI Bank (A/c No. 317805500006) of Equity Mania Financial Advisory, details of which were provided on the website of the Noticees. I also note that various credits have been received in this account from Payumoney and Instamojo payment gateways. From the detail of the said bank account, I note that total of Rs. 48.52 lakhs have been credited during the period December 16, 2016 to August 14, 2020. I note that there are 302 credit transactions received in the said bank account and from the narrative of the transactions, it appears that the payments have come from various investors / clients as illustrated in the table in para 3 (ix) above. From the aforesaid facts, I find that Equity Mania Financial Advisory was engaged in giving advice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, through its website www.equitymania.com. I note that the Customer Relationship Form for the ICICI Bank (A/c No. 317805500006) of Equity Mania Financial Advisory, copy of which was forwarded by the bank to SEBI, states that constitution of Equity Mania Financial Advisory is proprietorship firm. The said Customer Relationship Form further shows that Equity Mania Financial Advisory is a sole proprietorship of Mr. Ankit Goel. Thus, I find that Equity Mania Financial Advisory was the proprietary concern of Mr. Ankit Goel and was engaged in investment advisory activity. Further, I note that Mr. Ankit Goel vide his letter dated December 31, 2020 has not denied the allegations made against him in the Interim Order and has admitted that he was acting as an unregistered investment advisor and that he has not registered himself with SEBI. Further, the Noticees vide letter dated December 31, 2020 also submitted that he had collected money in lieu of the investment advisory services he was providing and has provided a listFinal Order against Equity Mania Financial Advisory (Prop: Mr Ankit Goel) Page 10 of 14  of the clients from whom he had taken payment. Further, I note that the Noticees vide their undated letter received by SEBI on August 25, 2020 had submitted the following information with regard to its plans and amounts collected from clients: Name of the package Number of Clients Amount Long term Investment 112 878152 Short term investment 59 1006837 Medium term investment 35 515806 Cash Intraday 4 76800 Option Intraday 4 61000 Future Intraday 2 250000 Cash positional 18 363287 Option positional 3 330000 Future positional 20 814401 Total 257 42,96,283  7. In view of this, I find that Noticees were providing the investment advice, in lieu of consideration. In terms of Regulation 2(1) (l) of IA Regulations, 2013 such an advice is \\\\\\\\u201cinvestment advice\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Noticees were engaged in the business of providing investment advice to public, for consideration and were thus, acting as an investment adviser, as defined under Regulation 2(1) (m) of the IA Regulations, 2013.    8. Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 provides as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  9. In order to protect the interest of investors and to maintain integrity of the securities market, IA Regulations, 2013 provides safeguards to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected. One such safeguard is thatFinal Order against Equity Mania Financial Advisory (Prop: Mr Ankit Goel) Page 11 of 14  any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to obtain registration from SEBI as required under Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013. Regulation 3(1) provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of IA Regulations. Further, safeguards provided under IA Regulations, 2013 includes continued minimum professional qualification and net-worth requirement for investment adviser, disclosure of all conflict of interest, prohibition on entering into transactions which are contrary to advice given for 15 days, risk profiling of investors, maintaining documented process for selecting investment for client based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s objective and risk profile, understanding the nature and risks of products or assets selected for clients, etc.   10. The activities of the Noticees, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that the Noticees were holding themselves out and acting as an investment adviser. However, it is noted that Equity Mania Financial Advisory is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of Investment Advisor, as also admitted by Mr. Ankit Goel in his letter dated December 31, 2020. Hence, I find that these activities/ representations as being made by the Noticees without holding the certificate of registration as investment adviser are in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013.   11. I note that the material available on record does not indicate the exact amount of fees collected by the Noticees,  as  a  result  of  providing  investment  advice  to investors,  in  violation  of  the  provisions  of  the  IA  Regulations, 2013.  However, from the ICICI Bank (A/c No. 317805500006) account statement of Equity Mania Financial Advisory obtained from the bank, it is observed that the bank account received credits of Rs. 48,52,941/- during the period December 16, 2016 to August 14, 2020. It is further observed from the submission of the Noticees (undated letter received by SEBI on August 25, 2020 and also vide letter dated December 31, 2020) as mentioned in para 6 above, that they have collected Rs. 42,96,283/- from 257 clients offering its services as mentioned on its website. IFinal Order against Equity Mania Financial Advisory (Prop: Mr Ankit Goel) Page 12 of 14  also note that the Noticees have claimed that they have not received any complaint from their clients for their investment advisory services rendered. However, the fact that the Noticees were engaged in the activity of an investment advisor without seeking registration from SEBI is itself violation of the SEBI Act, 1992 and IA Regulations, 2013, and is actionable under the SEBI Act, 1992 and IA Regulations, 2013.  12. In view of the foregoing, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Sections 11, 11(4),11B(1) and 11D, read with of Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992, and in supersession of the directions in the interim order, hereby direct that:  (i) The Noticees shall within a period of three months from the date of coming into force of this direction, refund the money received from the clients/investors/complainant, as fees or consideration or in any other form, in respect of their unregistered investment advisory activities;  (ii) The Noticees shall issue public notice in all editions of two National Dailies (one  English  and  one  Hindi)  and  in  one  local  daily  with  wide  circulation, detailing the modalities for refund, including the details of contact person such as names, addresses and contact details, within 15 days of coming into force of this direction;  (iii) The repayments to the clients/investors shall be effected only through Bank Demand Draft or Pay Order or electronic fund transfer or through any other appropriate  banking  channels,  which  ensures  audit  trails  to  identify  the beneficiaries of repayments;  (iv) The Noticees are prevented from selling their assets, properties and holding of mutual funds/shares/securities held by them in demat and physical form except for the sole purpose of making the refunds as directed above.

The direction for refund, as given in paragraph 12(i) above, does not preclude the clients/investors to pursue the other legal remedies available to them under any other law, against the Noticees for refund of money or deficiency in service before any appropriate forum of competent jurisdiction.  14.

Regulations, 2008 in the matter of Unickon Securities Private Limited.   NOTICEE SEBI REGISTRATION NO Unickon Securities Private Limited INF231283830/INB231283830 INB 011282531/INF011282531 IN-DP-CDSL-435-2007  BACKGROUND 1. Unickon Securities Private Limited (\\\\\\\\u2018USPL\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019) is a stock broker registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and is a member of the National Stock Exchange Ltd. (NSE) and the BSE Ltd. (BSE). USPL is also registered with SEBI as a Depository Participant and has an agreement with Central Depository Services (India) Limited (\\\\\\\\u2018CDSL\\\\\\\\u2019). The registered office of the Noticee is at D-221, Sector 63, Noida, Uttar Pradesh - 201301. 2. During the period starting January 2014, SEBI started receiving a large number of investor complaints against the Noticee. The complaints pertained to non-payment of funds and non-delivery of securities to clients. Given this sudden increase in the number of investor grievances filed against the Noticee, SEBI carried out an inspection of the affairs of the Noticee on March 19 and March 20, 2014. Pursuant to the inspection, it was observed that the Noticee was allegedly not complying with the provisions of the SEBI Act, the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulation, 1992 (Broker Regulations), SEBI (Intermediaries Regulations) 2008 (Intermediaries Regulations), SEBI (Depositories and Participants)Regulations, 1996 (DP Regulations) and the circulars issued thereunder. The_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Unickon Securities Private Limited                      2 details of the alleged violations observed during the inspection which was detailed in the Inspection Report(IR) are given below: a. Does not satisfy the criteria of \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019. b. Failure to furnish complete material information to SEBI during the inspection. c. Misutilisation of clients funds and securities, illegally pledging of client securities and diversion of funds to related entities.  d. Failure to submit the Internal Audit Report for the half-year ending September 2013 onwards to NSE and BSE. e. Non-redressal of investor grievances. 3. In view of the serious nature of the prima facie violations that  were observed during the inspection, SEBI in the interest of protecting the investors in the securities market, in exercise of powers under sections 11(1), 11(4), 11B and 11D of the SEBI Act, 1992, by way of an Ex-Parte -Ad-Interim Order dated May 26, 2014, issued the following directions: \\\\\\\\u201cA. restrain Unickon Securities Pvt. Ltd. (PAN: AAPFS5325P) and its directors namely, Mr. Gajendra Nagpal (PAN: AADPN5511A) and Mr. Ram Mohan Gupta (PAN: AGDPG7175M) from accessing the securities market and further prohibit them from buying, selling or dealing in securities market, either directly or indirectly or being associated with the securities market in any manner whatsoever, with immediate effect, till further directions; B. direct the above entities to cease and desist from the activities as noted above.\\\\\\\\u201d 4. SEBI vide order dated March 02, 2015, confirmed the findings in the said interim order. Thereafter, vide final order dated March 15, 2016, SEBI inter alia prohibited the Noticee and its directors from accessing the securities market and further prohibited them from buying, selling or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly, or being associated with the securities market in any manner whatsoever, for a period of ten years._______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Unickon Securities Private Limited                      3 5. Simultaneously with the aforesaid proceedings, SEBI initiated enquiry proceedings against the Noticee under Chapter V of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 (\"Intermediaries Regulations\") and appointed a Designated Authority (\"DA\") to enquire into whether the alleged violation of Regulation 9(a) and 9(b) of the Broker Regulations, Regulation 7(2)(e) read with Schedule II of the Intermediary Regulations, Regulations 6A(1) and 6A(2) of the DP Regulations by the Noticee warranted cancellation or suspension of the certificate of registration granted by SEBI or any other action provided in Chapter V of the Intermediaries Regulations.  6. The Show Cause Notice (SCN) which was issued to the Noticee in terms of Regulation 25(1) of the Intermediaries Regulations, by the DA, was sent to the registered address of the Noticee. The SCN, however, came back undelivered. Thereafter, the SCN was served on the Noticee at its alternate address \\\\\\\\u2013 69, II Floor, Regal Building, Connaught Place, New Delhi \\\\\\\\u2013 110001. The SCN was served by way of affixture at the alternate address of the Noticee. However, as no reply was received from the Noticee, the DA proceeded with the matter ex-parte.  On completion of the proceedings, the DA submitted the report on November 30, 2018 (DA\\\\\\\\u2019s Report) recommending that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s certificate of registration as a stock broker be cancelled.  7. Pursuant to this, a Post Enquiry SCN (P-SCN) dated December 21, 2018, was issued to the Noticee, under Regulation 28 (1) of SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008, to show cause as to why action, as recommended by the DA or any other action as considered appropriate by the Designated Member, should not be taken against the Noticee. A copy of the DA\\\\\\\\u2019s Report was also forwarded to the Noticee along with advice to file a reply, if any, within 21 days from the date of receipt of the notice. The P-SCN, which was sent to the alternate address of the Noticee, returned undelivered. Thereafter, it was attempted to_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Unickon Securities Private Limited                      4 serve the P-SCN to the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s registered address. However, as the P-SCN could not be served on the Noticee, even by way of affixture, at the two addresses available with SEBI, the P-SCN was uploaded on the SEBI website under >Enforcement>Unserved Summons/Notices. 8. Thereafter, the Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing on February 12, 2021. The notice of the issue of the post enquiry SCN and the hearing notice was served via newspaper publication in the Delhi Edition of one English newspaper (Times of India) and one Hindi newspaper (Dainik Jagran) on February 17, 2021. However, the Noticee failed to appear for the hearing.  9. In view of the above, I am satisfied that sufficient opportunities have been provided to the Noticee and the principles of natural justice have been complied with in this regard. I am, therefore, compelled to proceed with the present matter ex-parte based on the material available on record. CONSIDERATION  10. I have considered the Report submitted by the DA, the Post-Enquiry SCN issued to the Noticee, and other material available on record. The scope of the present proceedings before me is restricted to the enquiry initiated against the Noticee under Chapter V of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 to determine whether,  a. the alleged violation of Regulation 9(a) and 9(b) of the Broker Regulations Regulation; and  b. the failure to  satisfy the \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper criteria,  by the Noticee warrants cancellation or suspension of the certificate of registration granted by SEBI or any other action provided under Regulation 27 of the Intermediaries Regulation._______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Unickon Securities Private Limited                      5 11. Before moving forward, it will be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of the Broker Regulations, Intermediaries Regulations and DP Regulations alleged to have been violated by the Noticee: SEBI(Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992 5. Conditions of registration. (e)  is  a  fit  and  proper  person  based  on  the  criteria  specified  in  Schedule  II  of  the  Securities  and Exchange Board of India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008. 9. Any registration granted by the Board under regulation 6 shall be subject to the following conditions, namely, (a) the stock broker holds the membership of any stock exchange;  (b) he shall abide by the rules, regulations and bye-laws of the stock exchange which are applicable to him;  SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996 Requirement of fit and proper. 6A. (1) Every depository, its sponsor, shareholder and participant shall satisfy the fit and proper criteria at all times.  (2) For the purpose of determining whether an applicant, depository, its sponsor, shareholder, director and key management personnel or a participant, is a \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 under these regulations, the Board may take into consideration the criteria specified in Schedule II of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008.  (3) If any question arises as to whether a person is fit and proper, the Board\\\\\\\\u2019s decision on such question shall be final.  SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 Criteria for determining a \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Unickon Securities Private Limited                      6 For the purpose of determining as to whether an applicant or the intermediary is a \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 the Board may take account of any consideration as it deems fit, including but not limited to the following criteria in relation to the applicant or the intermediary, the principal officer, the director, the promoter and the key management persons by whatever name called \\\\\\\\u2013 (a) integrity, reputation and character;  (b) absence of convictions and restraint orders;  (c) competence including financial solvency and networth; (d) absence of categorization as a wilful defaulter.  ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION  Violation of Regulation 9(a) and 9(b) of the Broker Regulations  12. I note that Section 9(a) of the Broker Regulations provides that the certificate of registration granted by the Board is subject to a stock broker holding a valid membership of any recognised stock exchange. It is further noted that Regulation 9(b) mandates, as part of the conditions of registration, that the stock broker complies with the rules, regulations and bye laws of the stock exchange of which it is a member. I note from the material available on record that the NSE has expelled the Noticee vide order dated September 05, 2014, inter alia for misuse of clients securities, non-segregation of transactions between own and client accounts, failure to redress investor grievances and non-co-operation in the submission of documents, records and data. It is also noted that the BSE has also declared the Noticee as a defaulter w.e.f September 10, 2014. It is also noted that the rules of the stock exchanges provide that once a member of an exchange is declared a defaulter or_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Unickon Securities Private Limited                      7 expelled by any other exchange then such a member cannot continue or be admitted as a member. 13. I note that the eligibility conditions mandated under the Broker Regulations for grant of certificate of registration must be complied with by entities seeking registration not just at the time of registration, but they must continue to satisfy the specified criteria throughout the period of validity of their registration.  14. In view of the above, as the Noticee has been expelled/declared defaulter by the stock exchanges where it was a member, for non-compliance with their rules, regulations, bye laws and other provisions of the securities laws, I note that the Noticee no longer complies with the conditions of registration specified in Regulation 9(a) and (b) of the Broker Regulations.  Failure to satisfy the \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper criteria\\\\\\\\u2019 15. As stated in para 12, the Noticee has been expelled/declared defaulter by both the stock exchanges where it was a member. Further, as stated in para 4, SEBI vide order dated March 15, 2016, has prohibited the Noticee and its directors from accessing the securities market and further prohibited them from buying, selling or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly or being associated with the securities market for a period of 10 years.  16. I note that Regulations 5(e) of the Broker Regulations provides that an applicant seeking registration as a stock broker has to satisfy the \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper criteria\\\\\\\\u2019 specified under Schedule II of the Intermediaries Regulations. It is further noted that Regulation 6A of the DP Regulations provides that all registered participants have to comply with the \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper criteria\\\\\\\\u2019 at all times. The compliance with the \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper\\\\\\\\u2019 criteria specified under Schedule II of the Intermediaries regulations is applicable to all SEBI registered_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Unickon Securities Private Limited                      8 intermediaries and the compliance has to be satisfied on a continuous basis as long as an intermediary is registered with SEBI.  17. I note from Schedule II of the Intermediaries Regulations that some of the important factors which are to be taken into account while deciding whether an entity satisfies the fit and proper person, is its integrity, reputation, character and absence of restraint orders in respect of the entity. 18. It is, therefore, noted that while determining the compliance of an entity with the \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper\\\\\\\\u2019 criteria, restraint order passed against it is an important consideration. As stated earlier, the restraint order passed against the Noticee was on serious charges related to siphoning of client funds and securities. Moreover, the conduct of the Noticee was also found to satisfy the parameters of \\\\\\\\u2018fraud\\\\\\\\u2019 as defined under the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practises) Regulations, 2003. Thus, I note that the violations established against the Noticee are serious in nature and cast aspersions on the integrity, reputation and character of the Noticee. It is also pertinent to note that the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) vide its order dated April 26, 2021, has already upheld the common SEBI order restraining the Noticee while deciding an appeal preferred by one of the directors of the Noticee. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Tribunal while dismissing the appeal concurred with the findings in the SEBI order that \\\\\\\\u201cUnickon Securities not only misused the client securities without the consent of the clients through Unickon Fincap but itself also transferred the securities in its own demat account and, thereafter the funds were used for various purposes of financing group companies through inter-corporate deposits, fixed deposits, generating the income (maybe only in the books) much in excess than permitted.\\\\\\\\u201d 19. In view of the above, considering the totality of the facts and circumstances, I am of the view that the Noticee no longer satisfies the \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper\\\\\\\\u2019 criteria specified under_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Unickon Securities Private Limited                      9 Schedule II of the Intermediaries Regulations read with Regulation 5(e) of the Broker Regulations and Regulation 6A of the DP Regulations.  20. In view of the above, I agree with the findings of the DA that the Noticee has violated the provisions of the SEBI Act, the Broker Regulations and the DP Regulations as detailed in paragraphs 14 and 19 of this Order.  ORDER 21. I, in exercise of powers conferred under Section 19 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 read with Regulation 27 of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008, I hereby cancel the certificate of registrations granted to the Noticee / Unickon Securities Private Limited (SEBI Registration Nos.

Vide replies dated May 22, 2017, Noticee nos. 7 and 8 had submitted that they had acquired 9,25,200 shares and 8,10,540 shares, respectively, of the Company on July 16, 2009.  At the time of acquiring such shares, they were unaware of the requirement issued under Regulation 11(1) read with Regulation 14(1) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997 and neither were they advised to take any such actions.  Therefore, it was only upon receiving such communication from SEBI that they realized that the said Regulations were required to be adhered to under the Takeover Regulations, 1997.  They had no mala fide intention behind acquiring these shares and the said acquisition was done for investing in the Company after considering its prospect.  Further, the acquisition had not led to any disadvantage for the investors nor has it effected major change in control or management of the Company. ii. Vide replies dated May 22, 2017, Noticee nos. 1, 3, 5, 6 and 9 had inter alia submitted that SEBI had wrongly considered them as PACs for the acquisition made by Noticee nos. 7 and 8 i.e. Sanatan Herbals and Camson Farm in the year 2009, whereas the obligation of making the public announcement is of the Acquirers and not the PACs.  On a bare perusal of Regulation 11(1) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997, it becomes clear that it is the Acquirer and not the PAC, who is required to issue the public notice.  Thus, the Acquirer can acquire shares on his own or through or with PACs.  However, the Acquirer shall remain liable for making the public announcement and not the PAC.  The charges for non\\\\\\\\u2013compliance of Regulation 11(1) read with Regulation 14(1) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997 can only be against the Acquirers, Sanatan Herbals and Camson Farm and not us.  Laying down altogether different legal proposition that PACs are required to make public announcement is clearly in contradiction to the actual interpretation of Regulation 11(1) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997.  We have not made any acquisition of shares in the year 2009.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Camson Bio Technologies Limited    Page 9 of 24  iii. Noticee nos. 1, 3, 5, 6 and 9 had further submitted that for the purposes of the impugned acquisition, they were not acting in concert with the Acquirers.  The Acquirers acted on their own volition and there was no common intention to acquire any further shares or control.  Therefore, it is submitted that for the purposes of the impugned acquisition, we were not PACs along with the Acquirers.  Therefore, since they did not acquire any of the shares in question they were not obligated to make a public announcement.  Further, they had carried no such intention to put the investors of the company at a disadvantage. iv. Noticee nos. 1, 3, 5, 6 and 9 had further submitted that the acquisitions on July 16, 2009, had not led to any disadvantage for the investors nor had it effected major change in control or management of the Company.  In this context, the Noticees had relied on the observations of the Supreme Court in Hindustan Steel vs. State of Orissa (1969) 2 SCC 627, the Bombay High Court in SEBI vs. Cabot International 2004 SCC Online Bom 180.  B. Allegation concerning the violation of Regulation 11(1) read with Regulation 14(1) of the Takeovers Regulations, 1997 for acquisition of shares of the Company during the Financial Year ending March 31, 2011.   i. Vide replies dated May 22, 2017, Noticee nos. 1 and 9 submitted that they had each acquired 9,90,000 shares of the Company on March 14, 2011 by way of conversion of warrants.  At the time of acquiring such shares, they were unaware of the requirement issued under Regulation 11(1) read with Regulation 14(1) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997 and neither were they advised to take any such actions.  Therefore, it was only upon receiving such communication from SEBI that they realized that the said Regulations were required to be adhered to under the Takeover Regulations, 1997.  They had no mala fide intention behind acquiring these shares and the said acquisition was done for investing in the Company after considering its prospect.  Further, the acquisition had not led to any disadvantage for the investors nor has it effected major change in control or management of the Company. ii. Vide replies dated May 22, 2017, Noticee nos. 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 had inter alia submitted that SEBI had wrongly considered them as PACs for the acquisition made by Noticee nos. 1 and 9 i.e. Dhirendra Kumar and Shashtika Health in the year 2011, whereas the obligation of making the public announcement is of the Acquirers and not the PACs.  On a bare perusal of Regulation 11(1) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997, it becomes clear that it is the Acquirer and not the PAC, who is required to issue the public notice.

However, the Acquirer shall remain liable for making the public___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Camson Bio Technologies Limited    Page 10 of 24  announcement and not the PAC.  The charges for non\\\\\\\\u2013compliance of Regulation 11(1) read with Regulation 14(1) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997 can only be against the Acquirers, Sanatan Herbals and Camson Farm and not us.  Laying down altogether different legal proposition that PACs are required to make public announcement is clearly in contradiction to the actual interpretation of Regulation 11(1) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997.  We have not made any acquisition of shares in the year 2011. iii. Further, Noticee nos. 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 had submitted that for the purposes of the impugned acquisition, they were not acting in concert with the Acquirers.  The Acquirers acted on their own volition and there was no common intention to acquire any further shares or control.  Therefore, it is submitted that for the purposes of the impugned acquisition, we were not PACs along with the Acquirers.  Therefore, since they did not acquire any of the shares in question such obligation cannot be cast upon us to make a public announcement.  Further, they had carried no such intention to put the investors of the company at a disadvantage. iv. Noticee nos. 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 had further submitted that the acquisitions on March 14, 2011, had not led to any disadvantage for the investors nor had it effected major change in control or management of the Company and had relied on the observations of the Supreme Court and Bombay High Court in the above mentioned cases.  C. Subsequently, vide a reply received at SEBI on September 28, 2020, Noticee no. 3 had submitted an Affidavit stating that: \\\\\\\\u201cthe allegations levied vide the SCN dated January 31, 2017\\\\\\\\u2026 the emphasis of the investigation was to examine the holdings of all the Companies and its PACs with reference to Regulation 11(1) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997/Regulation 3(3) of the Takeover Regulations, 2011 for the period from January 1, 2008 to June 30, 2013 and disclosures made by the Company with respect to corresponding Promoter shareholding in the scrip of Camson Bio.   I say that I failed to make a public announcement of open offer within the stipulated time under Regulation 14 \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Camson Bio Technologies Limited    Page 11 of 24  D. In this context, vide common replies each dated October 20, 2020, Noticee nos. 1, 3, 5, 6 and 9 had inter alia submitted:   i. It is also pertinent to note here that during the financial year 2010, all responsibilities in respect of filings and compliances as mandated from time to time, were handled by Akbal Narayan Singh.  Further, Akbal Narayan Singh vide his Affidavit dated September 22, 2020 has taken sole responsibility to be held liable for any and all compliance issues that may arise in respect of the present transaction.  ii. Additionally, it is submitted that the Annual Reports for the Financial Years 2008 till 2013, have time and again been disclosed on the BgSE and the BSE websites and have also been duly circulated to the respective shareholders of the Company in due compliance with the regulatory requirements.  In this respect, no objections were raised by either the statutory auditor or the compliance officers of Company.  Therefore, there was no reason to believe at any point in time that a breach has taken place. iii. In and around November 2013, Geeta Singh and Karan Singh resigned from the position of Directors of Camson Farm.  iv. It is pertinent to note here that vide an Order dated July 31, 2015, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court at Karnataka had approved the scheme of arrangement (demerger) of seeds business from M/s Camson Bio to Camson Seeds Ltd. v. Further, on June 14, 2018, the National Company Law Tribunal, Bangalore had ordered Camson Bio to be liquidated under the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (\\\\\\\\u201cIBC 2016\\\\\\\\u201d). vi. As on date of reply i.e. October 20, 2020, Sanatan Herbals has been struck off from the Registrar of Companies (\\\\\\\\u201cROC\\\\\\\\u201d).  vii. Therefore, in light of the above circumstances, it is our humble submission that as on date, the penal measures as mentioned under Regulation 44 (f) stand without an effective remedy given that Camson Bio is already in the process of being liquidated.  In the given circumstances, SEBI, being the regulatory body is merely making an attempt to abuse its power to penalize me for an event in respect of which sufficient time has lapsed and effectively as on date, there lies no remedy.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Camson Bio Technologies Limited    Page 12 of 24  2.3 Vide replies dated March 3, 2017, May 23, 2017, October 4, 2017, November 24, 2017 and August 24, 2020, Noticee nos. 2 and 4 had inter alia submitted:   i. I (Veerendra Kumar) am not aware of any shares being allotted to me in the form of warrants since when I enquired with my brother, Dhirendra Kumar, he told me that these were not my shares but have been allocated to my namesake Veerendra Kumar Singh, who at that time was heading our marketing team.  Even if these shares had been allocated to me then the transfer of 3,35,200 shares to Sanatan Herbals (of which I am also not aware) was without my consent, which amounts to cheating and forgery.  The person in question i.e. Dhirendra Kumar, with the help of investors, made huge profits as the share prices rose to an all-time high of \\\\\\\\u20b9252 per share within a span of one year.  ii. I being one of the Promoters was always kept in the dark on the corporate affairs and was told that as Promoters we were not supposed to acquire shares whereas my brother did acquire shares by other means and through shell companies.  I came to know of his deeds only when my brother was asked to step down from the post of CMD and subsequently, I was made MD in 2006 but during that period also I was kept aside and not allowed to function independently as MD as my brother had control of majority shares. Although I was appointed Managing Director of Camson Bio, I was not allowed to have access to any documents and was barred from entering the office and factory both in Bangalore and Himachal Pradesh.  Secondly, all the official mails were on mail.camsonbiotechnologies.com and prior to that, sify.com was being used for correspondence and both the mails are not operational now, hence cannot retrieve any document from them.  I further wish to inform you that original shares of Camson Bio, which was to the tune of 1,10,000 shares was converted into digital form on September 5, 2017 through ICICI Bank Demat Services whereas the shares in question were allocated during the period of December 2008 to March 2009 and then transferred to Sanatan Herbals during the period of June 2009 to September 2009.   iii. The first time I doubted my elder brother\\\\\\\\u2019s intention was when the original shares in physical form (certificate bearing no. 17044 to 17143) were submitted for transfer in my name but to my surprise, I received a letter from the agency saying the same had already been transferred in the name of Dhirendra Kumar.  Fortunately, the copy of the said letter was sent to me by Mr. Sangayya who was associated and working with us right from the time we went public.  Even in the appointment letter as Managing Director, my brother had forged my father\\\\\\\\u2019s signature.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Camson Bio Technologies Limited    Page 13 of 24  iv. My shares of Camson Bio were in hard copy and got converted into demat in 2012 because the dividends were supposed to be paid directly in the bank account.  I had never been handed over any additional shares nor have I transferred the same to any one without financial gain.   v. I was not allowed to enter the premises of Camson Bio\\\\\\\\u2019s office or the factory (Bangalore and Bilaspur) after 28th September 2016 (as this was the date of AGM) as the difference had surfaced in open between me and my brother Dhirendra Kumar and had to walk out without even my dues being cleared.  In fact my wife had travelled to Bangalore in 2019 to see my ailing father but for your information she was not allowed to meet him even once during that trip. Her entry to the farm and his house was banned and she stayed with her cousin brother as last resort. vi. Truth will prevail and I am not above law but at the same time as per our system we should not punish a person if he has not done the act. Rest leaving it to my fate and will accept any judgment, penalty and punishment as I am born as brother of Dhirendra Kumar in this Life.  But once again I express our willingness to undergo any type of lie detector test as this is my only hope to prove my innocence. vii. I (Alka Singh) deny the allegations made against me in the SCN as I was not aware or informed of any of the transactions/acquisitions made on July 16, 2009 and March 14, 2011.   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS \\\\\\\\u2013   I have considered the SCN dated January 31, 2017 along with all the material available on record.  The relevant provisions of law alleged to have been violated by the Noticees are reproduced below:  Regulations 11(1) and 14(1) of Takeover Regulations, 1997 read as follows:  11.

Page 2 of 41 1. Background \\\\\\\\u2013 1.1. The present matter emanates from an investigation by SEBI into the issuances of Global Depository Receipts (\\\\\\\\u201cGDRs\\\\\\\\u201d) in overseas markets by Indian companies, allegedly with the intention of defrauding Indian investors. During the course of such investigation, it came to SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s knowledge that there were several other GDR issues wherein loan was taken by a foreign entity and the security of the loan was provided by the GDR issuing company by signing an account charge agreement. One such company was Sterling Biotech Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cSterling\\\\\\\\u201d/the \\\\\\\\u201cCompany\\\\\\\\u201d). 1.2. The focus of investigation was to ascertain whether the shares underlying the GDRs were issued with proper consideration and whether appropriate disclosures, if any, were made by Sterling with respect to GDRs issued by it on October 01, 2003. The period under investigation was the period around the issuance of GDRs by the Company, i.e. September 01, 2003 to October 31, 2003 (\\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d).  2. Summary of Show-cause Notice(s) - (i) The Scheme (ii) The Modus Operandi and Fund Flow 2.1. Pursuant to the findings of Investigation Report, a common Show-cause Notice dated March 05, 2018 was issued to the Noticees and a Supplementary Show-cause Notice dated April 03, 2019 was issued to Noticee No.1. Hereinafter, the above-mentioned Show-cause Notices are collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe SCN\\\\\\\\u201d.   By way of the SCN, all the Noticees were called upon to show cause as to why suitable   Order in the Matter of GDR Issue of Sterling Biotech Limited.     Page 3 of 41 directions should not be issued against them under Sections 11, 11B and 11(4) of the SEBI Act, and Noticee No.1 was also called upon to show cause as to why suitable directions, including the direction to bring back an amount of USD 12.37 million should not be issued against it under Sections 11 (1), 11B and 11(4) of the SEBI. 2.2. In this regard, the SCN relying on the Investigation Report has alleged that the scheme of issuance of GDRs was fraudulent as Noticee No. 1, the Company, had entered into an Account Charge Agreement with the Bank, Banco Efisa (\\\\\\\\u201cBanco\\\\\\\\u201d) for a loan that had been availed by Fresia Worldwide Ltd (\\\\\\\\u201cFresia\\\\\\\\u201d) towards the subscription of GDRs issued by the Company. The Account Charge Agreement was not disclosed to the stock exchanges, which made the investors believe that the said GDR issue was genuinely subscribed by the foreign investors. Noticee No. 2, Fresia was a party to this Fraudulent scheme. Noticee No.3, Nitin Sandesara, who was the Chairman and Managing Director of Sterling, signed an account charge agreement with Banco and pledged GDR proceeds as collateral against loan availed by Fresia from Banco for subscribing to GDRs of Sterling. Noticee Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, namely Chetan Sandesara, Rajbhushan Dixit, Narendra Patel, Vilas Joshi and P. B. Mehta were Directors on the Board of Sterling, and in the board meeting dated August 09, 2003 authorised Nitin Sandesara to sign the agreement pledging the GDR proceeds which acted as security in connection with loan availed by Fresia. The said directors also authorised Banco to use GDR proceeds as security against the loan.   Order in the Matter of GDR Issue of Sterling Biotech Limited.     Page 4 of 41  2.2 (I) The Scheme  A. The Company came out with the issuance of 2.32 million GDRs amounting to USD 15.37 million on October 1, 2003. Summary of the GDR issuance of Sterling is tabulated below: Table - 1 GDR issue date No. of GDRs  Issued Capital raised (US$mn.) Price per GDR (US$) Underlying shares per GDR Local custodian No. of equity shares underlying GDRs Global Depository Bank Lead Manager Bank where GDR proceeds deposited GDRs listed on 01-Oct-2003 23,28,045 15.37 6.6 6 ICICI Bank Ltd., Mumbai 1,39,68,270 The Bank of New York Mellon, USA Reliance Corporate Finance Limited, UK Banco Efisa Luxembourg Stock Exchange   B. For this purpose, a bank account was opened by Sterling with Banco to deposit the GDR proceeds. Accordingly, a total of USD 15.37 million was credited to this account. Out of the above amount, a total of USD 14,850,000   Order in the Matter of GDR Issue of Sterling Biotech Limited.     Page 5 of 41 credited to the GDR proceeds account of Sterling was from Fresia. So, Fresia had subscribed to nearly 96.65% of the GDR issue. Details of the amounts credited to the GDR proceeds account with Banco are tabulated hereunder: Table - 2 Date of credit of funds Credit amount (US$) Bank 30-09-2003 35,102 Aarguische Kantonalbank 01-10-2003 14,850,000 ContiFina, S.A. 02-10-2003 480,000 Bank Gutmann Total 15,365,097   C. It was observed during investigation that on May 06, 2004, an amount of USD 12, 200, 000 was transferred by Sterling to Fresia, the Entity which had subscribed to nearly 96.65% of the GDR issue. Considering that Fresia was one of the subscribers to the GDR issue and the company transferred nearly 80% of GDR proceeds back to Fresia, it was concluded that the GDRs, and the underlying equity shares in turn, to the tune of US$ 12.27 million, were effectively issued by Sterling to Fresia without any consideration, at the cost of shareholders / investors of Sterling. This is the alleged fraudulent scheme that had been conceived.   Order in the Matter of GDR Issue of Sterling Biotech Limited.     Page 6 of 41   2.2 (II) The Modus Operandi and Fund Flow  A. Fresia entered into a credit agreement dated September 29, 2003 with Banco for a term loan facility up to USD 15 million, with the purpose of subscribing to the GDRs being issued by Sterling. B. On August 09, 2003, the Board of Directors of Sterling passed a resolution (signed by Kirtidev Khatri, Company Secretary and Nitin Sandesara, Chairman of Sterling) resolving that a bank account to be opened with any Branch of Banco for the purpose of receiving subscription money in respect of the GDR issue of this company, and authorising Banco to use the GDR proceeds as security against loan availed by Fresia. C. Consequent to the above, an account charge agreement was executed between Sterling and Banco and the same was signed by Mr. Nitin Sandesara, CMD of Sterling. As per Account Charge Agreement, Sterling shall deposit in its designated account with Banco an amount not exceeding loan availed by Fresia for subscription of GDRs of Sterling as security for all the obligations of Fresia under the Credit Agreement.   D. The aforesaid account charge Agreement was an integral part of Loan Agreement entered into between Fresia and Banco and vice versa and both were executed concurrently. The account charge agreement had the reference to the credit agreement entered into between Fresia and Banco by virtue of which Banco provided loan to Fresia for the purpose of subscribing to the GDR of Sterling. The   Order in the Matter of GDR Issue of Sterling Biotech Limited.

Page 17 of 41 f. the pledge agreement was not signed by any of them,  though as Non-executive Independent Directors they did not doubt the credibility and legality of the pledge and loan agreements and they were under a bona fide belief that laws of the countries including India, involved in the process of issue of GDR allow Sterling to guarantee the security towards the loan taken by Fresia towards subscription money for the GDR; g. Section 5 of the Companies Act, 1956 provides that an officer of the Company who is in default shall be liable for punishment or penalty, and defines an \\\\\\\\u201c officer who is in default\\\\\\\\u201d to mean -    (a) the Managing Director or Managing Directors;    (b)\\\\\\\\u2026 (g) where any company does not have any of the officer specified in clauses (a) to (c), any director or directors who may be specified by the Board in this behalf or where no director is so specified all the directors; h. if a company has any officer specified in clause (a), the other officers will not be held as an officer in default as per Section 5 (g) of the Companies Act 1956, and as they were not in-charge or control of the day-to-day affairs of Sterling, they cannot be held responsible; and   Order in the Matter of GDR Issue of Sterling Biotech Limited.

Page 23 of 41 5. Issues I. Whether Sterling by allowing the GDRs proceeds to be used as security for a loan that had been availed by Fresia Worldwide Ltd towards the subscription of GDRs issued by Sterling , and not disclosing the same to the stock exchanges had devised a scheme with Fresia to defraud the investors ? II. Whether the Directors of Sterling, namely Nitin Sandesara (Noticee No.3)  Chetan Sandesara (Noticee No.4) , Rajbhushan Dixit (Noticee No 5), Narendra Patel (Noticee No.6), Mr. Vilas Joshi (Noticee No.7), and P. B. Mehta (Noticee No.8), who authorized Banco to use GDR proceeds as security in connection with loan, and Nitin Sandesara, who signed the account charge agreement acted as party to the fraudulent scheme ?   6. Consideration and findings \\\\\\\\u2013  Issue I- Whether Sterling had devised a scheme with Fresia to defraud the investors? 6.1. The SCN has alleged that issuance of GDRs by Sterling was fraudulent as the Company had entered into an Account Charge Agreement with the Bank, Banco for a loan that had been availed by Fresia towards the subscription of GDRs issued by the Company. The Account Charge Agreement was not disclosed to the stock exchanges which, the SCN alleges, made the investors believe that the said GDR issue was genuinely subscribed by the foreign investors.   Order in the Matter of GDR Issue of Sterling Biotech Limited.     Page 24 of 41 6.2. The Company by way of its replies has refuted the allegations made in the SCN and has presented its submissions in defence. The same have been captured in the previous part of this order, and accordingly are not being reproduced in toto here. It shall, however, be relevant to briefly mention herein the fundamental grounds of defence taken by the Company. The said grounds are: a. the investigation period dates back to the year 2003, and the SCN has been issued after the lapse of almost 15 years, which is a violation of the principles of natural justice; b. the Company has been relegated to insolvency proceedings vide order dated June 11, 2018 of the NCLT, Mumbai and is currently under liquidation, and therefore any/all proceedings against the Company be abated; and c. the Company neither consented nor connived with the promoters and directors who were in-charge or control of the day-to-day affairs of the Company in transactions creating misleading appearance, and hence the Company can never be held responsible. 6.3. With respect to the submission of the Noticee that there has been delay in the proceedings, it is seen from the record that investigation in the matter was concluded in October, 2017. Pursuant to the completion of the investigation in the matter, the SCN was issued to the Noticees on March 05, 2018. Subsequent to the issuance of SCN, Settlement Applications were filed by Vilas Joshi, P.B. Mehta and Rajbhushan Dixit. After the disposal of the Settlement Applications, opportunity of inspection was granted on November 11, 2020. Also, opportunities of personal   Order in the Matter of GDR Issue of Sterling Biotech Limited.     Page 25 of 41 hearing were granted on October 28, 2020, November 12, 2020 and February 16, 2021. 6.4. It is stated that in the case of Government of India V. Citedal Fine Pharmaceuticals, Madras and Others [AIR 6 (1989) SC 1771], the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court held that in the absence of any period of limitation, the authority was required to exercise its powers within a reasonable period. The court further held that the reasonable period would depend on the facts of each case, and that no hard and fast rule could be laid down in this regard. In this regard, reference is made to the Order dated March 17, 2020 of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Pooja Vinay Jain V. SEBI [Appeal No. 152 of 2019]. By way of the said appeal, an Order passed by SEBI against the Appellant for having been involved in fraudulent trading in shares was challenged. The Appellant claimed that since the proceedings were launched by SEBI after a period seven years, she should be exonerated on that ground. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, considering the above-mentioned principle enunciated by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, held that for want of any prejudice, the proceedings cannot be quashed simply on the ground of delay in launching the same. So, I do not find that the delay in issuance of the SCN can be a ground for disposing of the SCN without any adjudication, in view of the gravity and seriousness of the violations alleged in the SCN.  6.5. Now coming to the question of abatement of the present proceedings owing to the status of Sterling as a company in liquidation, I shall refrain from passing any directions against the Company. However, I am of the view that it does not preclude me from adjudicating the matter against the Company.   Order in the Matter of GDR Issue of Sterling Biotech Limited.     Page 26 of 41 6.6. As regards the allegation in the SCN that Sterling had devised a fraudulent scheme with Fresia, it has been asserted by the Company that the Company neither consented nor connived with the promoters and directors who were in-charge or control of the day-to-day affairs of the Company in transactions creating misleading appearance, and hence the Company can never be held responsible. Building on this argument, the Company asserts that the Company being a separate legal person from the directors and/or other officers of the Company in the eyes of the law, and the alleged transactions being undertaken by the promoters and directors at their own discretion by virtue of their position, and it is they who should be held liable and not the Company as per Section 2 (30), which pro", "Date": "2021-06-22", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Order in the matter of GDR issue of Sterling Biotech Ltd[561/2021][562/2021][563/2021]", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jun-2021/order-in-the-matter-of-gdr-issue-of-sterling-biotech-ltd_50659.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 63861, "unique_record_id": "a82e4e1567SEBI20210622", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6682606b7858910306473474", "parse_date": "2024-07-01 07:52:25", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "USD 12,37,000", "gpt_audience": "1.

In pursuance of the aforesaid order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, Common Authorised Representative Shri Vedchetan Patil (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAR\\\\\\\\u201d) of the Noticees vide an email dated May 09, 2021 has submitted a common undated Application (for short \\\\\\\\u201capplication / representation\\\\\\\\u201d) on behalf of all the Noticees, specifying the constraints faced by the Noticees on account of directions issued by Securities and Exchange Board of India (for convenience \"SEBI\") vide an ex-parte Interim Order dated January 25, 2021 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cInterim Order / Interim Order cum SCN\\\\\\\\u201d). Subsequently, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, a personal hearing of the Noticees was conducted through video conferencing mode on May 17, 2021, which was attended by the Noticee no. 2 alongwith the said common AR of the Noticees and made their oral submissions on the lines of the representation already filed by them with SEBI. Pursuant to the aforesaid personal hearing, certain details pertaining to the client agreements and fees collected by the three Noticees viz. Noticee no. 1, Noticee no. 5 and Noticee no. 7 (hereinafter collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201c3 Noticee Companies\\\\\\\\u201d) were sought from the AR of the Noticees, in response to which a reply in the desired format was filed by the AR of the Noticees vide email dated June 02, 2021. 3. I note that the Noticees in their common representation have, inter alia, submitted various arguments. The arguments relevant to the present proceedings as advanced by Noticees through their written as well as oral submissions are summarised herein below: a) Noticee no. 2 is the actual and defacto owner and controller of the 3 Noticee Companies and it is only Noticee no. 2, who is running the business of________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited.                                              Page 3 of 27 Investment Advisory (for short \\\\\\\\u201cIA\\\\\\\\u201d) through the above named 3 Noticee Companies.  b) Noticee no. 2 has obtained the registration as an Investment Advisor under the category of Individuals, under regulation 3 of the SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (for short \\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations, 2013\\\\\\\\u201d). In fact, it was Noticee no. 2 and not the 3 Noticee Companies who were soliciting investors to deal in securities market. The said IA activities and the monies collected were indeed collected on behalf of the Noticee no. 2 and the 3 Noticee Companies were merely an interface. c) Noticee no. 2 had met an officer of SEBI who had informed the Noticee no. 2 at the time of seeking registration, that after obtaining registration in his individual name, the Noticee no. 2 can do the business in the name of his company. Therefore, Noticee no. 2 was under a bonafide understanding that once the registration certificate was obtained in his individual name under IA Regulations, 2013, it was permissible for him to execute the IA services through Private Limited/incorporated Companies. Accordingly, Noticee no. 2 incorporated 3 different companies namely Noticees no. 1, 5 and 7 along with his wife (Noticee no. 4) where both of them were 50% shareholders. d) In the month of August 2020, Noticee no. 2 visited the SEBI western regional office (WRO) to inquire about the transfer of his personal registration in favour of the Company and also to inquire about obtaining separate IA registrations in favour of some of his acquaintances who were interested in carrying out the said business and upon such inquiry, Noticee no. 2 was informed that SEBI does not permit the individual registration granted under the IA Regulations, 2013 to be utilized for carrying out IA services through any incorporated entities. Accordingly, immediately upon receipt of such information, all the IA activities were ceased by the 3 Noticee Companies and they only received some pending payments for the advisory services already given. It is needless to mention that after the meeting with SEBI officials in August 2020, 3 Noticee Companies did not render any________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited.                                              Page 4 of 27 advisory service but had only accepted pending payments for previously rendered commitments. e) Noticees no. 3, 6 and 8 were inducted in the respective companies as shareholders, only in June 2020. Immediately upon their induction, they (through Noticee no. 2) had requested the registration to be in the name of the respective companies. Noticees no. 3, 6 and 8 though were appointed as Directors in December 2019, still they had not acted upon the said directorship as immediately upon their appointment, the lockdown was imposed within a period of 3 months. Further, though on Noticees no. 3, 6 and 8 were appointed as directors, they only intended to actually intervene in the business in the administrative and financial manner, by infusing working capital, only upon the transfer of the shares of the said company, which only happened in June 2020. Hence, even otherwise, any action against Noticees no. 3, 6 and 8 is not necessary as they were only in the process of entering in to the said business and before they could successfully even provide administrative assistance which would have any material bearing on the business, the Lockdown was imposed and naturally said Noticees could not act or perform any duties as director of the 3 Noticee Companies. f) Regarding the complaint filed by one Hareesha, Noticees have submitted that the said complaint was false as the said complainant was neither the customer of any of the Noticees nor said person who has supposedly represented himself to be the employee of Noticees, was ever an employee either directly or indirectly, of any of the Noticees. Further, the said complaint was resolved as soon as the said complainant had lodged a police complaint and the police machinery was utilized to settle his grievances. g) Noticee no. 2 through the 3 Noticee Companies was providing IA Services to more than 415 customers and there are only 6 complaints against them on SEBI Complaint Redress System (for short \\\\\\\\u201cSCORES\\\\\\\\u201d). Further, all the aforementioned 6 SCORES complaints referred to the names of the 3 Noticee________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited.                                              Page 5 of 27 Companies, namely Noticees no. 1, 5 and 7, hence, SEBI was aware that the Noticee no. 2 was running business in the name of the 3 Noticee Companies. Therefore, it may not be appropriate to state that SEBI was not aware of Noticee no. 2 running the business on the name of 3 Noticee Companies. h) Noticees have submitted that to ascertain whether the 3 Noticee Companies were actually providing the IA Services without obtaining appropriate registration, corporate veil must be lifted and the actual person/entity providing the IA services through 3 Noticee Companies may be identified. In this regard, Noticees have relied upon the judgements of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of State of UP vs Renusagar Power Co. and Ors. (1988) 4 SCC 59.  i) No IA activity was carried out prior to registration of the Noticee no. 2 and the amount of INR 9,76,298/- was not collected toward the Investment Advisory services as recorded in the Interim Order. Further, the amount of credits received in the bank accounts of the 3 Noticee Companies reflected in the Interim Order are not limited toward the sale of the IA services but also towards various loans taken by the 3 Noticee Companies from third parties.  j) Noticees have further contended that one of the essential ingredients of the fraud and fraudulent conduct independent of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations, 2003\\\\\\\\u201d) is mens rea which in turn has to be supported with a motive to commit such fraud. In fact, when Noticee no. 2 himself had the registration certificate, there was no need for the Noticee no. 2 to commit any fraud in the name of the company. Noticee no. 2 could have very well conducted the business on his own name, however, he was under a bonafide impression that he could conduct the business through companies, needless to mention that it was Noticee no. 2 who was handling the IA services himself.________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited.                                              Page 6 of 27 k) It has been further submitted that when the directors (Noticees no. 3, 6 and 8) of the 3 Noticee Companies were under bonafide belief that the said services are provided by Noticee no. 2 through 3 Noticee Companies, the question of shifting the liability on the directors does not arise, unless specific allegation against Noticees no. 3, 6 and 8 for such non-compliance is made out in crystal clear terms.  It has also been submitted that Noticees no. 3, 6 and 8 though were appointed as Directors of Noticees no. 1, 5 and 7 respectively in December 2019, still they had not acted upon the said directorship as immediately upon their appointment, as the nationwide lockdown was imposed within a period of 3 months. As the whole doctrine of Section 179 of the Companies Act, 2013 is in root based upon the principles of lifting of corporate veil, invocation of Section 179 of the Companies Act, 2013 to hold the directors (Noticees no. 3, 6 and 8) of the 3 Noticee Companies responsible while clandestinely overlooking the registration certificate of the Noticee no. 2, is unjust and erroneous. l) Regarding the role of Noticee no. 4, it has been submitted that she had never exercised any control over the 3 Noticee Companies and was only appointed as director for being the wife of Noticee no. 2. It has been further submitted that she was all throughout a sleeping and inactive director in all the 3 Noticee Companies and has hence accordingly resigned in March 2020. m) Presently the 3 Noticee Companies jointly employed around 45 staff and if the 3 Noticee Companies are allowed to continue with the business after obtaining appropriate Registration, it will be beneficial in the interest of more than 45 families. n) While submitting the aforesaid arguments, Noticees have requested the following relief from the directions of the Interim Order: i. Revoke the Interim Order passed against all the Noticees; ii. All or either of the 3 Noticee Companies (Noticees no. 1, 5 and 7) may be allowed to make appropriate application before the SEBI, to obtain________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited.                                              Page 7 of 27 appropriate registration certificate as per provisions of the IA Regulations, 2013; iii. Till the time either of the 3 Noticee Companies is able to get the registration certificate on their name, Noticee no. 2 may be allowed to conduct and provide the IA services business on his individual name in compliance with the IA Regulations 2013. 4. I have perused the representation made by the Noticees and the allegations qua them levelled in the Interim Order cum SCN and in compliance of the aforesaid directions of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, I proceed to dispose of the representation. However, before that I find it imperative to recall in brief, the relevant facts pertaining to the matter that have caused the issuance of the aforesaid Interim Order issued by SEBI under Sections 11, 11B and 11D of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) which are as follows:   a) SEBI received a complaint dated August 5, 2020 through SCORES against Mr. Himanshu Bharatkumar Bhavsar (Noticee no. 2). The complainant had attached a copy of FIR lodged with Bangalore City, Cyber Crime Police Station along with his complaint. He had mentioned in the FIR that one Mr. Rahul Sharma called the complainant and promised assured returns on his investment of INR 8,00,000/-. Having induced by the promise of assured return, the complainant had transferred INR 8,18,550/- to various bank accounts of Vishwas Stocks Research Pvt Ltd (Noticee no. 7). b) The 3 Noticee Companies held out themselves as Investment Advisors and collected subscription fees from various investors for providing stock recommendations although no registration was obtained by them in their own names for providing Investment Advisory services under IA Regulations, 2013. c) It was further gathered that the 3 Noticee Companies were hosting various contents on their respective websites wherein various services offered by them were described and all the 3 Noticee Companies were holding________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited.                                              Page 8 of 27 themselves out as Investment Advisers and were undertaking to offer advice related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and are also offering various investment packages for subscription. It was further revealed that the 3 Noticee Companies have disclosed to possess SEBI Registration No. INA000011501 which they have displayed on their respective websites. d) It was further revealed from the webpages of the respective websites of the 3 Noticee Companies that the above stated SEBI Registered No. INA000011501 displayed on their websites actually pertained to the Noticee no. 2 who is a common Director in the 3 Noticee Companies and the said registration was granted by SEBI to him as an individual applicant. The legal status mentioned in the application of aforesaid registration number is \\\\\\\\u201cIndividual\\\\\\\\u201d. e) Noticee no. 4 was also a Director in the 3 Noticee Companies alongwith Noticee no. 2 till March 21, 2020. It was also observed that Noticee no. 3, Noticee no. 6 and Noticee no. 8 had joined as Director from December 21, 2019 in the Noticee no. 1, Noticee no. 5 and Noticee no. 7 respectively. f) Further, from an analysis of the bank statements of the aforesaid 3 Noticee Companies, it was observed that the consolidated credit amount received in various accounts of the 3 Noticee Companies was approximately INR 2.12 crore for Noticee no. 1 and INR 1.19 crore for Noticee no. 5 during the period from February 2018 to August 2020 and INR 93.89 lakh for Noticee no. 7 during the period from January 2018 to August 2020. g) On the basis of the aforesaid facts and allegations made in the complaint, prima facie it was observed in the Interim Order that the 3 Noticee Companies have not only falsely held themselves out as Investment Advisers but have also indulged in rendering IA services for consideration for which no registration as mandated under the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the IA Regulations, 2013 was obtained by them. Therefore, the activities of the 3________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited.                                              Page 9 of 27 Noticee Companies alongwith other Noticees were prima facie observed to be in violation of provisions of Section 12(1), 12A (a), (b), (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 alongwith regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003 and regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013. 5. Accordingly, on the basis of the information gathered and considering the serious implications on the interest of the investors, illegal advisory activities undertaken by the Noticees without obtaining registration certificate from SBEI, it was thought proper to urgently pass an order and issue directions as preventive measures protecting the interest of investors of securities market and consequently, the following directions were issued against the Noticees in the aforesaid Interim Order: a) To cease and desist from acting as investment advisors including the activity of acting and representing through any media (physical or digital) as an investment advisor, directly or indirectly, and cease to solicit or undertake such activity or any other activities in the securities market, directly or indirectly, in any matter whatsoever, until further orders; b) Not to divert any funds raised from investors, kept in bank accounts and/or in their custody until further orders; c) Not to dispose of or alienate any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge on any of such assets held in their name, including money lying in bank accounts except with the prior permission of SEBI; d) To immediately withdraw and remove all advertisements, representations, literatures, brochures, materials, publications, documents, communications etc., physical or digital or on their website, in relation to their investment advisory activity or any other unregistered activity in the securities market until further orders; e) Not to access the securities market and buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, until further orders;________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited.                                              Page 10 of 27 f) To provide a full inventory of all assets held in their name, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge on any of such assets, including details of all bank accounts, demat accounts and mutual fund investments, immediately but not later than 5 working days from the date of receipt of this order, and  g) To submit the number and details of clients who have availed their investment advisory services and to submit details of fees collected from each such client, immediately but not later than 5 working days from the date of receipt of this order. 6. It is pertinent to reiterate here that the instant proceedings have emanated from the directions of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT wherein Noticees have been granted liberty to file an application proposing for revocation/modification of the directions issued in the Interim Order for consideration and passing of an appropriate order by SEBI.  Therefore, the limited purpose of this proceeding is to examine the submissions advanced by the Noticees and to consider as to whether based on the explanation submitted the Noticees, the Interim order dated January 25, 2021 deserve any modification/revocation, so far as the directions issued therein are concerned.  In view of the above, the scope of the present proceedings is limited to the examination of the following issue: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Whether the explanations furnished by the Noticees on various grounds, warrant any interim relief and thereby any modification/revocation in the Interim Order? 7. Before I proceed to examine the submissions of the Noticees so as to determine the issue delineated above, I find from the Interim Order that the Noticees have been charged with serious allegations of indulging in unregistered activities thereby violating the SEBI Act, 1992, relevant regulations of PFUTP Regulations, 2003 and the relevant provisions of IA Regulations, 2013 and further called upon them to explain as to why services offered by the 3 Noticee Companies be not held as \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advisory Services\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of the IA Regulations, 2013 apart from conducting their businesses in a manner which can be treated as a fraudulent practice / act / conduct, in terms of SEBI Act, 1992 and the PFUTP Regulations, 2003.________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited.                                              Page 11 of 27 8. Now, I proceed to the deal with the submissions canvassed by the Noticees to make out a case for themselves while seeking modification/ renovation in the Interim Order. I find one of the contentions of the Noticees that in the course of discussions held with SEBI officials at the time of seeking registration, Noticee no. 2 was told by an officer of SEBI that after obtaining IA registration in his individual name he can carry on his IA business in the name of a company. To start with, I note that the above submission is a mere bald statement having no basis to be relied upon. Even assuming the said submission to be true for a moment, I find no justification or explanation had been offered by the Noticee no. 2 to explain as to why he chose to act on such an unsolicited opinion. It is the duty of the Noticees to carry out their business activities in accordance with the relevant provisions of laws laid down for operating as a registered IA in the Indian Securities Market. An activity, which is otherwise prohibited, cannot be permitted on the ground that such activity was pursued based on an unsolicited oral opinion of an officer of SEBI without furnishing any evidence to support such a claim. It is a trite law that doctrine of estoppel cannot be invoked for preventing an authority from acting in discharge of its duties under the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. It cannot be used to compel the authority or even a private party to do an act, which is otherwise prohibited and not permissible under the law. It is the obligation of an entity to do its own due diligence and understand the regulatory framework before undertaking any activity. In my view, the Noticee no. 2 should have made his own due diligence to find out as to whether carrying on the activities of Investment Advisory Services in the name of a Corporate Body was within the scope of the applicable rules and regulations, when the registration was granted to him in his individual capacity. If it was not within the scope of the applicable law, then no amount of unsolicited advices by any person, even an oral advice from an officer of SEBI can create a right for the Noticees to claim that the 3 Noticee Companies have conducted the business of Investment Advisory Service under a presumption of law, sans any such legal provision to support such a presumption.  Further if it was the Noticee no. 2 who was instrumental behind managing the affairs of the 3 Noticee________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited.                                              Page 12 of 27 Companies, these companies cannot use the Registration that was granted to the Noticee no. 2 to carry on IA services in his individual capacity and not to dispense those services in the names 3 separate corporate entities. Thus, the said claim of having received an advice / opinion from an officer of SEBI, would not create an enforceable right on his part to claim legalisation of acts committed by the 3 Noticee Companies that were otherwise wrongful and illegal. 9. The Noticees have also tried to buttress the argument of their innocence and bonafide intention by submitting that they had ceased all the activities and postponed all plans of restarting the business of the 3 Noticees Companies after August, 2020, when the Noticee no. 2 during his visit to the WRO of SEBI was informed that he cannot provide IA services through a company after seeking registration certificate in the individual category. In this regards, I note from the records available before me including the observations in the Interim Order that the respective websites of the 3 Noticee Companies were still live and functional as on the date of said Interim Order i.e. on January 25, 2021 and these websites were having actively inviting the clients to avail investment advisory services from them by claiming that they provide the finest stock market tips and help the clients achieve higher returns. I note from the Interim Order that the websites of the 3 Noticee Companies also provided the details of all the products being offered by these 3 corporate entities and the details of fees charged for these products. These websites also provided a list of 11 bank accounts to which advisory fees can be paid, details of which have been specifically mentioned in the Interim Order. Thus, the claim of the Noticees that they had stopped the activities of rendering IA services post August 2020 is prima facie factually incorrect and false. 10. It has been submitted by the Noticees that upon coming to know the fact that the activities of Investment Advisory can\\\\\\\\u2019t be done in the name of corporate entities when the certificate of registration is granted in the capacity of an individual, they had immediately stopped providing all kind of Investment Advisory services. They have further submitted that any payment received in the Bank accounts of the 3 Noticee Companies i.e. Noticees no. 1, 5 and 7 was received________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited.                                              Page 13 of 27 against the services already rendered prior to August, 2020. However, on examination of the materials submitted by the Noticees vide email dated June 02, 2021 it is seen that the 3 Noticee Companies were continuously receiving payment for different periods of service rendered even beyond August 2020 on a regular basis. A few instances observed from such details submitted by the Noticees are tabulated below: Noticee no.

Thus, I note from the aforementioned table that the aforesaid claim of the Noticees appear to be not correct and the 3 Noticee Companies were continuously providing their IA services despite having come to know after the personal visit of Noticee no. 2 to WRO that they cannot conduct IA business through corporate bodies when the certificate was granted in the name of an individual. Any activities of rendering advisory services related to investment in securities market would tantamount to indulging in unregistered activities. The aforesaid payment details submitted by the Noticees themselves explicitly indicate the malafide________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited.                                              Page 14 of 27 intention of the Noticees as it has been admitted by them that they were very well aware about the illegality in conducting IA services through 3 Noticee Companies without obtaining valid Registration Certificate under IA Regulations, 2013 but continued with to provide those services unabatedly despite having come to know of the illegality of the same. If the Noticees were so compliant with regard to the extant regulatory guidelines, details of IA services including the Registration Certificate of Noticee no. 2 should have been removed forthwith from the websites of the 3 Noticee Companies as soon as they came to know the illegality of their activities and they should have stopped receiving fresh payments for the new service periods, from their clients, which belie the claim of the Noticees that the 3 Noticee Companies stopped all activities immediately post August 2020.  In view of the aforesaid factual observations about the way the 3 Noticee Companies conducted their illegal IA Services, in my opinion, the submissions of the Noticees regarding their bonafide intention behind conducting IA services deserve to be rejected. 12. It has been submitted that it was Noticee no. 2 and not the 3 Noticee Companies who were soliciting investors to deal in securities market and the said IA activities undertaken and the monies collected from the clients were indeed being done on behalf of the Noticee no. 2 in which the 3 Noticee Companies were serving merely an interface. Therefore, Noticees no. 1, 5 and 7 may also be exonerated. In this regard, first of all, it is an admitted fact that that the 3 Noticee Companies were charging fees from various clients in name of IA services for which, no separate registration to operate as IAs was obtained by them. Further, the webpages of the 3 Noticee Companies had displayed the SEBI registration number granted to the Noticee no. 2, who was registered with SEBI i", "Date": "2021-06-22", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Final Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jun-2021/final-order-in-the-matter-of-vishwas-stocks-research-private-limited-dalal-stocks-advisory-private-limited-and-devki-stocks-private-limited_50661.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 63853, "unique_record_id": "4189d72b9bSEBI20210622", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "66825f7c7858910306473466", "parse_date": "2024-07-01 07:48:43", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Unregistered", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "INR 9,76,298", "gpt_audience": "- Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\n- Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited\n- Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited\n- Devki Stocks Private Limited\n- Investors and clients of the mentioned companies\n- Legal and compliance teams of financial advisory firms\n- Financial regulators and authorities\n- Legal professionals and consultants in securities law\n- Directors and shareholders of the involved companies\n- Employees of the involved companies\n- Honble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT)", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

Noticee nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 \\\\\\\\u2013 The alleged conversion of warrants and transfer of funds were neither fraudulent nor with the intention to deceive nor manipulative.  The Company issued convertible warrants as a step of reviving itself from the financial crunch, which it was facing from 2008 onwards.  On January 24, 2009, Noticee nos. 2, 3, 5, 6 and 9 had invested in shares of the Company believing that the investment will prove profitable in future as the Company was in the process of revival.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Camson Bio Technologies Limited    Page 10 of 42  ii. Noticee no. 7 \\\\\\\\u2013 My husband, Anil Kshetry, was working with the Company as General Manager from 1996.  On January 24, 2009, I had invested in shares believing that the investment will prove profitable in future as the Company was in the process of revival.    iii. Noticee no. 8 \\\\\\\\u2013 I had acquired shares on January 24, 2009, believing that the investment will prove profitable in future.  However, on July 16, 2009, since no benefits accrued on the said investments and the price per share fell, I transferred my shares to Sanatan Herbals.  My acquisition and transfer of shares was neither fraudulent nor with intention to deceive nor manipulative.  The Company was taking steps for reviving its financial position.     iv. Noticee no. 12 \\\\\\\\u2013 Noticee nos. 7 and 11 had approached us as they wanted to sell off their holdings in the Company on account of not having reaped any benefits therefrom and as the price of the scrip was falling.    v. Noticee no. 13 \\\\\\\\u2013 Noticee nos. 4 and 8 had approached us as they wanted to sell off their holdings in the Company on account of not having reaped any benefits therefrom and as the price of the scrip was falling.  B. Allegation concerning the violation of Regulation 7 of the Takeover Regulations, 1997 read with Regulation 35 of the Takeover Regulations, 2011 and also under Regulation 13 of the Insider Trading Regulations, 1992 and Clause 4.2 of the Model Code of Conduct under Schedule I of the aforesaid Regulations read with Regulation 12(2) of the Insider Trading Regulations, 2015.   i. Noticee no. 2 \\\\\\\\u2013 For the acquisitions on June 16, 2009, I had filed timely disclosures on June 17, 2009 with Camson Bio as required under Regulation 13(4) read with Regulation 13(5) of the Insider Trading Regulations, 1992 read with Regulation 12(2) of the Insider Trading Regulations, 2015.  I believed that pursuant thereto Camson Bio would make disclosure to the stock exchange under the Insider Trading Regulations, 1992 and thus, the information will be known to the public.      ii. Noticee no. 4 \\\\\\\\u2013 I most humbly submit that for the acquisition on January 24, 2009 and transfer of shares to Sanatan Herbals on July 16, 2009, I had filed timely disclosures on January 26, 2009 and July 18, 2009 (as annexed) with Camson Bio as required under Regulation 13(4) read___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Camson Bio Technologies Limited    Page 11 of 42  with Regulation 13(5) of the Insider Trading Regulations, 1992.  I believed that pursuant thereto Camson Bio would make disclosure to the stock exchange under the Insider Trading Regulations, 1992 and thus, the information will be known to the public.  Further, at the relevant time, I was not aware nor advised of the requirement of compliance with Clause 4.2 of the Code of Conduct in Schedule I of the Insider Trading Regulations, 1992, as alleged.  It is pertinent to note that Clause 4.2 restricts opposite transaction for a period of 6 months, which would have been completed after around only a week from the date of the alleged transfer.  Had I been aware of the requirement of compliance with Clause 4.2, I would have waited till completion of 6 months.  The alleged non\\\\\\\\u2013compliance was totally unintentional and arose out of ignorance.  iii. Noticee no. 6 \\\\\\\\u2013 For the acquisitions on January 24, 2009, November 19, 2009 and September 20, 2010, I had filed timely disclosures on January 26, 2009, November 19, 2009 and September 21, 2010 with Camson Bio as required under Regulation 7(1) read with Regulation 7(2) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997 read with Regulation 35 of the Takeover Regulations, 2011 and also under Regulation 13(1) read with Regulation 13(3) of the Insider Trading Regulations, 1992.  I believed that pursuant thereto Camson Bio would make disclosure to the stock exchange under the Takeover Regulations, 1997 and the Insider Trading Regulations, 1992 and thus, the information will be known to the public.  iv. Noticee no. 8 \\\\\\\\u2013 I most humbly submit that at the relevant time, I was not aware nor advised of the requirement of compliance of Clause 4.2 of the Code of Conduct in Schedule I of the Insider Trading Regulations, 1992, as alleged.  It is pertinent to note that Clause 4.2 restricts opposite transaction for a period of 6 months, which would have been completed after around only a week from the date of the alleged transfer.  Had I been aware of the requirement of compliance with Clause 4.2, I would have waited till completion of 6 months.  The alleged non\\\\\\\\u2013compliance was totally unintentional and arose out of ignorance.    v. Noticee nos. 12 and 13 \\\\\\\\u2013 For the acquisitions on July 16, 2009, I had filed timely disclosures on July 18, 2009 with Camson Bio as required under Regulation 7(1) read with Regulation 7(2) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997 read with Regulation 35 of the Takeover Regulations, 2011 and also under Regulation 13(1) read with Regulation 13(3) of the Insider Trading Regulations, 1992.  I believed that pursuant thereto Camson Bio would make disclosure to the stock___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Camson Bio Technologies Limited    Page 12 of 42  exchange under the Takeover Regulations, 1997 and the Insider Trading Regulations, 1992 and thus, the information will be known to the public.  C. Allegation concerning the violation of Clause 13.1C of the DIP Guidelines, 2000 read with Regulation 111 of the ICDR Regulations, 2009.   i. No reply was submitted by Camson Bio or its Directors, Dhirendra Kumar and A. N. Singh, in respect of this allegation.   D. As stated earlier, vide a reply received at SEBI on September 28, 2020 (prior to the hearing held on September 30, 2020), Noticee no. 3 had submitted an Affidavit, stating: \\\\\\\\u201cthe allegation levied vide SCN are true and I am solely responsible.\\\\\\\\u201d    2.3 Vide replies dated March 3, 2017, October 4, 2017, November 24, 2017 and August 24, 2020, Noticee no. 4 (Veerendra Kumar Singh) had inter alia submitted:   i. I (Veerendra Kumar) am not aware of any shares being allotted to me in the form of warrants since when I enquired with my brother, Dhirendra Kumar, he told me that these were not my shares but have been allocated to my namesake Veerendra Kumar Singh, who at that time was heading our marketing team.  Even if these shares had been allocated to me then the transfer of 3,35,200 shares to Sanatan Herbals (of which I am also not aware) was without my consent, which amounts to cheating and forgery.  The person in question i.e. Dhirendra Kumar, with the help of investors, made huge profits as the share prices rose to an all-time high of \\\\\\\\u20b9252 per share within a span of one year.  ii. I being one of the Promoters was always kept in the dark on the corporate affairs and was told that as Promoters we were not supposed to acquire shares where as my brother did acquire shares by other means and through shell companies.  I came to know of his deeds only when my brother was asked to step down from the post of CMD and subsequently, I was made MD in 2006 but during that period also I was kept aside and not allowed to function independently as MD as my brother had control of majority shares. Although I was appointed Managing Director of Camson Bio, I was not allowed to have access to any documents and was barred from entering the office and factory both in Bangalore and Himachal Pradesh.  Secondly, all the official mails were on mail.camsonbiotechnologies.com and prior to that, sify.com was being___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Camson Bio Technologies Limited    Page 13 of 42  used for correspondence and both the mails are not operational now, hence cannot retrieve any document from them.  I further wish to inform you that original shares of Camson Bio, which was to the tune of 1,10,000 shares was converted into digital form on September 5, 2017 through ICICI Bank Demat Services whereas the shares in question were allocated during the period of December 2008 to March 2009 and then transferred to Sanatan Herbals during the period of June 2009 to September 2009.   iii. The first time I doubted my elder brother\\\\\\\\u2019s intention was when the original shares in physical form (certificate bearing no. 17044 to 17143) were submitted for transfer in my name but to my surprise, I received a letter from the agency saying the same had already been transferred in the name of Dhirendra Kumar.  Fortunately, the copy of the said letter was sent to me by Sangayya who was associated and working with us right from the time we went public.  Even in the appointment letter as Managing Director, my brother had forged my father\\\\\\\\u2019s signature.   iv. My shares of Camson Bio were in hard copy and got converted into demat in 2012 because the dividends were supposed to be paid directly in the bank account.  I had never been handed over any additional shares nor have I transferred the same to any one without financial gain.   v. I was not allowed to enter the premises of Camson Bio\\\\\\\\u2019s office or the factory (Bangalore and Bilaspur) after 28th September 2016 (as this was the date of AGM) as the difference had surfaced in open between me and my brother Dhirendra Kumar and had to walk out without even my dues being cleared.  In fact my wife had travelled to Bangalore in 2019 to see my ailing father but for your information she was not allowed to meet him even once during that trip. Her entry to the farm and his house was banned and she stayed with her cousin brother as last resort.   vi. Truth will prevail and I am not above law but at the same time as per our system we should not punish a person if he has not done the act. Rest leaving it to my fate and will accept any judgment, penalty and punishment as I am born as brother of Dhirendra Kumar in this Life.  But once again I express our willingness to undergo any type of lie detector test as this is my only hope to prove my innocence.   2.4 Vide a reply dated November 9, 2017, Noticee no. 9 (Sudha K.) had denied the allegations in the SCN and had provided bank statements of HDFC Bank Account no. 03541050000053, jointly held in the name of one Gururaja R. and her evidencing the transfer of \\\\\\\\u20b98 Lakh on October 30, 2007, \\\\\\\\u20b990 Lakh on November 3, 2007 and \\\\\\\\u20b92 Lakh on March 17, 2008, to Camson Bio as consideration towards the allotment of warrants and shares.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Camson Bio Technologies Limited    Page 14 of 42   2.5 Vide replies dated (a) May 12, 2017, (b) February 23, 2018, (c) July 11, 2019 and (d) October 12, 2020, Noticee no. 10 (K.

It is further alleged that Noticees Adjudication order in the matter of Himachal Fibres Ltd Page 13 of 58 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7, i.e. Rishi Jain, Vijayalaxmi Jethmal Jain, Chandini Nitesh Badlani, Bhavini Mehul Modi and Ashishkumar Jethmal Jain indulged in an act amounting to manipulation of the price of the scrip and created misleading appearance of trading in the scrip through small trades. Thereby, it is alleged that Noticees violated section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 and regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a) and 4(2)(e) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  4. The details of delivery of SCNs and further communication with Noticees are as follows: 4.1. Rishi Jain, Vijaylaxmi Jethmal Jain and Ashishkumar Jethmal Jain The common SCN dated November 06, 2020 was sent to the Noticees via SPAD. However, the SCN sent to Rishi Jain returned undelivered. The SCN was also served on the Noticees vide digitally signed email dated November 09, 2020. Vide emails dated November 29, 2020 and November 27, 2020, Noticees acknowledged the receipt of the SCN and requested for inspection of the documents relied upon to form allegations in the matter. Vide letters dated December 08, 2020 and emails dated December 09, 2020, Noticee were granted the opportunity of inspection. Vide emails dated December 19, 2020, December 14, 2020 and December 12, 2020, Rishi Jain, Ashishkumar Jethmal Jain and Vijayalaxmi Jain respectively intimated that they would file their reply in the matter after availing the opportunity of inspection. Vide email dated December 26, 2020, Noticees reiterated request for availing inspection of documents in the matter. Vide emails dated January 07, 2021, Enforcement Department of SEBI (EFD) provided inspection of documents to Noticees digitally in view of the situation prevailing due to COVID pandemic. Vide emails dated January 22, 2021, Noticee were granted opportunity of personal hearing on February 04, 2021. Vide emails dated January 23, 2021, Noticees made written submissions as regards inspection of documents provided to them. The submission of Ashishkumar Jethmal Jain is summarized below. Rishi Jain and Vijayalaxmi Jethmal Jain made their submissions dated January 23, 2021 along the same lines: Adjudication order in the matter of Himachal Fibres Ltd Page 14 of 58 This is with reference to your email dated 22nd January, 2021, whereas I have been notified about the opportunity of personal hearing before the Hon'ble Adjudicating Officer, Shri K Saravanan at 14:30 AM on February 04, 2021, at the following address \\\\\\\\u2014 Securities and Exchange Board of India, SEBI Bhawan-ll, Plot No C-7, Block G, near NSE Exchange Plaza, Bandra Kurla Complex, Mumbai \\\\\\\\u2014 400051. In this regard there is a humble prayer that in the current situation where its not possible to procure current documents from broker due to imposed restrictions, whereas the inspection period is of 21.08.2014 till 21.10.2015 is more than 5 to 6 years back dated period.  I categorically would like to put the written submissions in support of my defense against the alleged violations, but as you must be aware that purpose of inspection was to look for entire set of documents corresponding exactly with nature of allegations, but the supplied information do not seem adequate. Since I have already submitted I would like to place my written submission and for that to properly written requires lot of documents probing and digging deep of my resources. So, it\\\\\\\\u2019s my humble submission, that kindly allow me time till 15th February, 2021 for written submission and postpone the notified hearing thereafter. Another humble request is hold the hearing between 15.02.2021 to 19.02.2021 and if that is not possible then after 28th February, 2021 any time. I hope you will consider my request and act kindly over the same. Moreover, whenever the personal hearing is proposed I would like to attend the same along with my authorized representative in person. I would like to thank you for sharing the documents through your mail dated 7 December, 2021, against my request for inspection of documents vide my letter dated 22 December, 2020. In this regard I would like to submit that post inspection of documents supplied by you, I found that those are inadequate vis a vis the allegations vide SCN dated November 06, 2020. Further this is to bring to your knowledge that the case file, was restricted to the xerox copies of the documents which are already supplied along with the SCN. Adjudication order in the matter of Himachal Fibres Ltd Page 15 of 58 I was only given inspection of the records (photocopies, not original) of the same documents thereby, rendering the inspection exercise perfunctory, futile and incomplete. You would appreciate that per applicable law, inspection of the record involves, inspection of the \\\\\\\\u201cfull records in the matter. including of those records that are relevant to arrive at a finding in the matter, and those that may be relevant to substantiate the charges contained in the impugned order and also that may be relevant to undermine the charges contained in the Show Cause Notice.\\\\\\\\u201d On a perusal of the SCN, it is evident that Investigation has in its possession records beyond the documents enclosed and/or referred to in the SCN. Further I also need to be allowed the documents like details of transactions, Ledger of that period as that is more than 5 years old and since pandemic is there and it is very much impossible to have these details and other records to prove the allegations. You would appreciate that it is a settled principle of law that an entity sought to be proceeded against should not only be made aware of the case that is sought to be made against it but also should be made aware of the material available with the concerned authority (either in favor or against the said entity). In the absence of such material our clients will not be able to appropriately defend itself. In view of the above, we request you to kindly provide us with proper inspection of the complete case file more specifically. Before proceeding to deal with the allegations in the SCN it is pertinent to note that SEBI while issuing the SCN has relied upon trading details and data showing connections among several entities. However, none of such details have been provided to me along with the SCN. Connections have been relied upon by SEBI to prove connection between entities, however only a glossary details on total transfer of shares has been Provided and not the complete details of transfer/receipt of shares have been provided. I deny that there is any link or correlation with trades and transfer, but the fact remains that the transfer data is not provided to me and without the complete data i.e. each record of those alleged transfer during previous long back, their reason, dates of the transfer, I would not be able to show that Adjudication order in the matter of Himachal Fibres Ltd Page 16 of 58 there is no link between the transfers and alleged connection among suspected entities. Alternatively, SEBI can show as to which alleged transfer correlates with which order and I would reply to it specifically. This would also help in showing the fact that no trades were done knowingly to manipulate market as alleged. In this regard attention is drawn to the judgment of Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Dhirajbhai V Sanghvi HUF vs. SEBI, Appeal No. 414 of 2018 (Date of decision 79/02/2020) wherein it was held as under: \\\\\\\\u201c7. In the light of the aforesaid, without going into the veracity of the submissions made by the learned counsel for the appellants as to whether the appellants were connected persons or whether there were actual synchronized trades or reversal trades, the appeals are being allowed on the Short ground of violation of the principles of natural justice. We find that the AO has considered the trade logs, order logs and the investigation report in coming to the conclusion that the appellants had indulged in synchronized and reversal trades. This Tribunal in Ketan Parekh vs. SEB/I Appeal No. 2 of 2004 decided on July 14, 2006 held that the nature of transaction executed, the frequency of the transactions is undertaken, the value of the transactions, whether they involved circular trading and whether there is a change in the beneficial ownership, the condition which have prevailing in the market are some of the factors which goes to show the intention of the parties. These factors can only be considered and found if trade logs, order logs and the investigation report are supplied to the appellants and a finding is given on that aspect.

From the above, it is alleged that the company has shown same purpose for raising funds through the IPO process as well as for availing loans from to the concerned bank. The company, on page 20 of the Prospectus, has disclosed as under: \"In case of any variation in the actual utilisation of funds earmarked for the above activities, increased fund deployment for a particular activity will be met from our internal accruals.\" 2.16. It is also further disclosed as under: \"The objects of the issue are proposed to be financed entirely through the proceeds of the issue less the issue expenses and including proceeds of pre-IPO placement. The shortfall shall be financed through internal accruals\" 2.17. The following is also mentioned in the annual reports of the company: 2.18.

From the Annual Reports, it is observed that the money utilised in setting up the plant is within the estimates mentioned in the Prospectus. Thus, the need to raise bank finance for the same does not arise. The fact of the company raising bank finance for the objects to the issue has also not been disclosed in the Annual Report. 2.20. It is observed that Indian Bank had conducted an investigation into the sanction and conduct of the BBIL account and the following is the analysis and the gist of the report of Indian Bank's vigilance department to its Head office : i. Availing Double finance: BBIL managed to avail double-finance for the company\\\\\\\\u2019s expansion projects and also convinced the consortium of banks to increase working capital limits. In addition, the company also issued unsecured NCDs for \\\\\\\\u20b9100 crore to LIC Mutual Fund (LICMF). ii. Non utilization of loan proceeds: The company did not use the term loan proceeds to expand the manufacturing facilities as per plan outlined in its term loan application, nor were the enhanced working capital funds used properly to improve the performance of the company. The company forayed into real estate projects and diverted substantial part of loan funds into those projects. The company reported a loss in the year ended March 31, 2010 and approached the DCR cell, RBI for restructuring its debt. The auditors, in their remarks in the financials of the company for the Financial Years 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11, have also stated that the term loans availed in the earlier years have not been utilized for the purpose for which they were sanctioned. iii. Purchase of second hand machinery: Second-hand machinery were purchased for Bangalore plant though term loan was availed for purchase of new machineries. As per the fixed asset valuation report obtained in Sept 2009, most of the machinery for purchase of which theFinal Order in the matter of Blue Bird (India) Limited       Page 9 of 71   company proposed to use the term loan proceeds were not purchased and the available machineries at Bangalore factory were all used-machineries. On an examination of the Annual reports of the company for the Financial Years 2007-08 and 2008-09, there does not seem to be any remark made by the company as to whether the machinery is first or second hand. The company appears to have bought second-hand machinery and assigned a realizable value of \\\\\\\\u20b9 71.97 lacs in September 2009.   iv. Non/Wrong disclosure of information in the Balance Sheet: The NCDs of the company were subscribed by LICMF, thereby raising \\\\\\\\u20b9 100 crore in April 2008. However, while the company claims that they repaid in 2008-09, the company has shown to have repaid the same only to avail the credit again. The company ventured into real estate in 2008 and invested the aforementioned fund, by its own admission vide letter dated March 18, 2009 to Indian Bank, in quite a few properties. However, from an examination of the financial results of the company, it can be seen that the real estate properties i.e. addition to Fixed Assets (Land) during 2006-07 and later, purchased by the company, were not brought into the books of the company.  v. Winding up orders: LICMF and Barclays Bank (not consortium members) have already obtained an order of winding up of BBIL. Another company, Ambica Cotton Mills Ltd, has also obtained a winding up order from the civil court in a suit filed against the company under Sec.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. vi. Sales tax demand and fudged sales: There is a Sales Tax demand notice for Rs. 44 Crore for the period from 2006-2010 and this indicates that the company deliberately reported higher sales to misguide the bankers and the investors including its shareholders but reported actual lower sales to the Sales-Tax authorities and paid lower sales-tax. But Sales-Tax authorities have raised supplemental demands on the basis of balance-sheet sales figures. The company has provided for the above tax demand on the basis of balance-sheet as at 31-03-2011 increasing the net loss.Final Order in the matter of Blue Bird (India) Limited       Page 10 of 71   vii. Write off of debts without assigning reason: There was a provision for bad debts amounting to Rs. 25 Crore during the year ending March 31, 2010. There was further write off of bad debts amounting to Rs. 142.89 cr. in 2010-11. No details were furnished by the company as the basis on which the provision was finalized and branch\\\\\\\\u2019s letters seeking details of debtors whose debts were written off were not responded to by the company. The company in its annual report for the year 2010-11, has mentioned that it has written off debtors worth the said amount in addition to provisions made in the previous year. They have concluded that due to such write off, the company's entire net worth has eroded. This is ostensibly to get themselves included as a sick company under the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). However, the BIFR has rejected the company's proposal. viii. Write off of stocks without assigning reason: In the Balance sheet as at March 31, 2011, stocks have been written down Rs. 128.70 cr. based on the technical report by Director (Technical & Production), but the said report has not been shared with the consortium banks. It can be seen from the Annual report of the company for the Financial Year 2010-11 that the following disclosure appears: \"the management, in order to depict the factual position of the company and on the basis of the reports of the technical and production director has reduced realizable value of the finished goods at 40% of the net realizable value and raw materials, components and spares are valued at 60% of purchase price.\" This is again ostensibly to get themselves included as a sick company under the BIFR. However, the BIFR has rejected the company's proposal.  It is of note that the auditors have not made any specific comment on the aforesaid writing off of stocks and debtors. ix. Resignation of independent directors: Quite a few independent directors resigned from the Board during 2008-09 and 2009-10. Some of them resigned within six months of their appointment. Both the statutory auditors of the company also resigned one after the other in 2009-10 andFinal Order in the matter of Blue Bird (India) Limited       Page 11 of 71   2010-11. These stand testimony to the steady deterioration evidenced in the affairs of the company. 2.21. Indian Bank has, in its report, classified the loan account of Noticee No. 1 as 'fraud' for the following reasons: a. The company has fudged its balance sheet figures in collusion with its auditors. The inconsistencies noticed in the monthly operational data submitted by the company corroborate the fudging indulged in by the company. b. The company availed double-finance for its project at Bangalore and Pune c. The company though availed 80% of term loan sanctioned, did not implement even 20% of its expansion project d. The company diverted substantial part of loan funds to purposes which were not approved by lenders. e. There is a strong possibility that the company inflated its sales, book debts figures to mislead the bankers. Sales-tax demand of Rs. 44 cr served on the company for the period 2005-10 by Maharashtra Sales Tax authorities indicates that the company earlier reported lower sales and accordingly paid lower sales tax and sales tax authorities have raised a supplemental demand on the basis of sales reported in balance-sheet of the company during the period from 2005-10. f. Real estate assets created by diversion of loan funds were not brought into the books of the company. g. Company has declined to give the full details of its debtors (it has refused to cooperate for a special investigative audit commissioned by the lending consortium) and it is a strong possibility that its book debts are not backed by genuine commercial transactions and exist in its books only to avail finance form the lending banks.  2.22. The statements of certain key personnel of BBIL and others, as mentioned below, were recorded by SEBI.    a. Shri Akhilesh Soni, former Company Secretary (joined in August 2007)Final Order in the matter of Blue Bird (India) Limited       Page 12 of 71   b. Shri David Kunder, former CFO (joined in 1999) c.

Shri Raju Nair, owner of Nairs Distributors Private Limited g. Shri Purushottam Rajaram Moghe, owner of Dhanashree Enterprises 2.23. During investigation by SEBI, it was inter alia observed that Mr. Nitin Sontakke & others have used following entities to show fictitious purchase and sales transactions:   a. Nairs Distributors Private Limited b. N.R. Distributors Private Limited c. M/s Dhanashree Enterprises d. Laukik Paper Industries Private Limited e. Sailab  Marketing Services Private Limited f.

Out of the above, statements were recorded of persons in control of entities mentioned at (a), (b) and (c) above. In their statements, the persons have inter-alia stated that the entities mentioned at (a) to (o) above were directly or indirectly controlled by Mr. Nitin Sontakke & others.Final Order in the matter of Blue Bird (India) Limited       Page 13 of 71   2.25. On Analysis of bank statements, Ledger accounts and statement of recordings of some of the controlled entities, the following was allegedly ascertained regarding the entities- 2.26. Nairs Distributors Private Limited i. Mr. Nitin Sontakke & others used Nairs Distributors Private Limited to allegedly show fake purchase for BBIL & diverting the funds. This entity was shown as creditor in the books of BBIL. It is observed that Shri Jayant Vasantrao Kolapkar, auditor of BBIL, was also the auditor of this company. ii. The following table indicates the alleged fake purchases done by BBIL from this entity over the years.

It is alleged that Mr. Nitin Sontakke and others used to submit the pre-assigned invoices, pre-signed delivery challans and pre-signed letterheads to the entity banks for discounting the bills. After the credit of the payment against Letter of Credit (LC) facility sanctioned to BBIL, Mr. Nitin Sontakke and others used to withdraw the amounts in the cash through pre-signed cheques.  2.27. M/s Dhanashree Enterprises i. Mr. Nitin Sontakke & others used this entity to show fake purchase for BBIL & diverting the funds. This entity was shown as creditor in the books of BBIL. It may be noted that Sh. Jayant Vasantrao Kolapkar was auditor of the firm. ii. The following table indicates the fake purchases done by BBIL from this entity over the years (Based on statements recorded).

After the credit of the payment against LC facility sanctioned to BBIL, Mr. Nitin Sontakke and others used to withdraw the amounts in the cash through pre-signed cheques.  2.28. N.R. Distributors Private Limited i. Mr. Nitin Sontakke & others used this entity to inflate the sales of BBIL & diverting the funds. This entity was shown as debtor in the books of BBIL. It may be noted that Sh. Jayant Vasantrao Kolapkar was auditor of the firm. ii. The following table indicates the fake sales from BBIL by this entity over the years.  Fake Sales  (in crores)  from BBIL during Financial Year 2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 2007-8 2008-09 28.27 41.42 127.66 31.97 --  iii. For making the payment for these sales, the amount was arranged from other controlled entities. Then the money were transferred to BBIL.  2.29. Similar transactions can also be seen in the Chargesheet filed by CBI.  2.30. The modus operandi of such transactions is given below: a. BBIL opens a facility for letter of credit with Banks.  b. Fake purchases are recorded from the controlled entities (as having sold to BBIL) c. Based on the amounts recorded as purchases(which are fictitious) to the controlled entities, BBIL, either directly or by discounting a letter of credit, transfers money to the bank accounts of these controlled entities.  d. Since Mr. Nitin Sontakke and Shri David Kunder can operate the bank account of the controlled entities, he: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Withdraws some part/all of the money directly in the cash from the accounts and  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Transfers the remaining money in the bank account to another controlled entity.Final Order in the matter of Blue Bird (India) Limited       Page 15 of 71   \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Makes the other controlled entity transfer such remaining money to BBIL, which shows it as sales revenue. 2.31. The whole modus operandi allegedly was to defraud the bank of the money raised through working capital loans, letters of credit and cash credits.  2.32. It is alleged that the fraud was perpetrated from Financial Year 2004-05 to Financial Year 2009-10. Based on these fake transactions, BBIL has manipulated its financial statements, showing a more than healthy picture of its profit and loss account and balance sheet.  2.33. Recourse is taken to the CBI Chargesheet, to portray the extent of manipulation in the financial statements of BBIL, for the following reasons - \\\\\\\\uf0a7 The CBI has collected all original documents from the company; \\\\\\\\uf0a7 The CMD of the company, Mr.Nitin Sontakke has not co-operated with the investigation; \\\\\\\\uf0a7 There is no filing of balance sheet or profit and loss account after the Financial Year 2011-12; \\\\\\\\uf0a7 The company is not operating since the past few years; \\\\\\\\uf0a7 Many of the persons associated with the company are not contactable and \\\\\\\\uf0a7 Annual reports of the company are not available for the past five years,  2.34. Accordingly, the following tables and Statement of records have been taken from the CBI Chargesheet to provide a comparison of the actual sales/purchases with recorded sales and purchases.  Sales and Purchase Data as per CBI documents  Description Year ended March ,31 (in Millions) As per FS Actual As per FS Actual As per FS Actual As per FS Actual 2004-05 2004-05 2005-06 2005-06 2006-07 2006-07 2007-08 2007-08 Domestic sales 328.24 284.44 393.04 349.11 448.49 133.25 449.68 419.46 Purchases 330.61 76.16 343.83 31.89 450.59 27.69 408.32 362.54Final Order in the matter of Blue Bird (India) Limited       Page 16 of 71   *FS= Financial statements  2.35. It is alleged that based on these manipulated statements, BBIL got listed on stock exchange in 2006. Further in Financial Year 2007-08 and 2008-09, BBIL availed finances for the projects for which it has already raised the money from public issue. Based on these manipulated annual statements, it got good credit rating from CARE Ratings Limited (CARE). Such acts cause serious prejudice to integrity of the securities market. The actual financial results remained within knowledge and possession of the Mr. Nitin Sontakke but the false and misleading financial results were published.  2.36. It is observed that on July 16, 2014, the firm's Managing Director Shri Nitin Sontakke and Financial Director Shri David Kunder, who were arrested on July 16, were remanded in judicial custody till August 2 on the basis of a complaint from the CBI's Economic Offences Wing for allegedly duping Indian Bank, Pune, to the tune of Rs. 74 crore. 2.37. It is further observed that the auditors, in their remarks in the financials of the company for the Financial Years 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11, have stated that the term loans availed in the earlier years have not been utilized for the purpose for which they were sanctioned. 2.38. It is observed that summons were issued to Shri Nitin Sontakke. The following table provides the details of the summons and non-compliance:  Date of SEBI letter Date of deposition Result September 30, 2016 October 7, 2016 Did not appear October 13, 2016 October 21, 2016 Did not appear December 30,2016 January 5, 2017 Did not appear January 09,2017 January 18, 2017 Did not appear January 20,2017 February 3, 2017 Did not appear January 27, 2017 February 15, 2017 Did not appear 2.39. It is further observed that in the letter dated January 27, 2017, SEBI had intimated Mr. Sontakke that this would be the last opportunity afforded to him and in case of non-compliance, SEBI would proceed on the basis of documents available on record, including action for non-compliance. But, he failed to depose each time citing one orFinal Order in the matter of Blue Bird (India) Limited       Page 17 of 71   other reason. Even though he was afforded sufficient opportunity to depose, he chose not to appear thereby not complying with the SEBI directions and consequently, not co-operating with the investigation.  2.40. Further, the findings of the Report of the Disciplinary Committee, The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), is as under- A. Shri Jayant Vasantrao Kolapkar, CA, one of the Auditors (\\\\\\\\u201cRespondent\\\\\\\\u201d) had issued a certificate on June 04, 2009 certifying that M/s Blue Bird (India) Ltd has incurred capital expenditure for a sum of Rs. 90.49 Crore as on March 31, 2009. However, on cross verification of the above figures with the audited balance sheet of the company for Financial Year 2008-09, it is observed that the above certified figures do not match with the figures appearing in Scheduled V of the balance sheet. Shri Jayant Vasantrao Kolapkar, in his defence, submitted that the company while finalising the accounts at March 31, 2009, had taken cognizance of cancellation of work orders and receiving back of the cheques given as advance. This is the cause of the difference between the amount shown in the certificate and Audited balance sheet for Financial Year 2008-09. B. In the matter, the committee opined that the Respondent had wrongly included the amount of advance as expenditure incurred on Plant & Machinery without verifying details of encashment of cheques. The Respondent was required to show the advance separately in the certificate so as to enable its user to take note of the same for a logical decision. Further being aware of cancellation of cheques, the Respondent should have included a reference of the same in his audit report. Hence the committee observed that the Respondent did not exercise due diligence while certifying certificate in respect of capital expenditure by including a subjective disclosure and did not take  care to adequately qualify the same in the audit report. The committee observed the Respondent is guilty of professional misconduct within the meaning of Clause (7) & (8) of Part I of Second Schedule to the Chartered Accountants Act,1949 as amended from time to time.Final Order in the matter of Blue Bird (India) Limited       Page 18 of 71   2.41. It is further observed that Shri Jayant Vasantrao Kolpkar, CA, Auditor of BBIL had been the statutory auditor for controlled entities viz. N.R Distributors Private Limited, Sailab Marketing Services Private Limited etc. during relevant period. Therefore, it is clear that Shri Nitin Sontakke and Shri David Kunder, with the help of Shri Jayant Vasantrao Kolpkar, has committed a white collar financial fraud with pre-meditated and well thought of plan and deliberate design for personal gains and to the detriment of the company and investors in its securities. Such acts cause serious prejudice to integrity of the securities market. The actual financial results remained within knowledge and possession of the Shri Nitin Sontakke, Shri David Kunder and Shri Jayant Vasantrao Kolpkar, but the false and misleading financial results were published.  2.42.

Moongipa Investments Limited (\\\\\\\\u2018MIL\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019) is a stock broker registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and is a member of both the National Stock Exchange Ltd. (NSE) and BSE Ltd.(BSE). The registered office of the Noticee is at No.6, 2nd Floor, BN Block, Local Shopping Centre, Shalimar Bagh, New Delhi \\\\\\\\u2013 110088. 2. During  the  period  July  11 to July 23,  2015,  SEBI  received 16  complaints  against  the Noticee through  the SEBI  Complaints  Redressal  System  (SCORES) platform. The complaints pertained to non-payment of funds and non-delivery of securities to the  clients. In view of this sudden increase in the number of investor grievances filed against the Noticee, SEBI carried out an inspection of the affairs of the Noticee. Pursuant to the inspection, it was observed that the Noticee was allegedly not complying with the provisions of the SEBI Act, the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956, the SEBI(Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers)Regulation, 1992 (Broker Regulations) and the circulars issued thereunder. The details of the alleged violations observed during the inspection which was detailed in Inspection Report(IR) are given below,- a. Non-segregation of own and clients funds and securities, and misutilisation of clients funds and securities._______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Moongipa Investments Limited                          2 b. Indulging in activities other than stock broking business involving accepting deposits and paying interest thereon to clients.  c. Non-compliance with the requirement of periodical settlement of client accounts.  d. Non-redressal of investor grievances. 3. In view of  the serious nature of the prima facie violations that  were observed during the inspection, SEBI in the interest of protecting the investors in the securities market, in exercise of powers under sections 11(1), 11(4), 11B and 11D of the SEBI Act, 1992, by way of an Ex-Parte -Ad-Interim Order dated September 10, 2015 issued the following directions: \\\\\\\\u201ca) The  financial  assets  of  Moongipa  Investments  Limited  (PAN: AAACM5584A)  and its  directors  namely,  Mr.  Madhur  Agarwal  (PAN: AAFPA1251Q),  Mr.  Sudhir Agarwal    (PAN: AAFPA1250R)    and    Mr. Subhash    Chander    Singal    (PAN: AALPS3587R)   and   its   former   director   Mr.   Shiv   Kumar   Agarwal   (PAN: AAFPA1252P) are  hereby  impounded till  further  directions.  They  are  further directed  not  to  dispose  off  or  alienate  any of  their assets,  whether  movable  or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets except for the purpose provided herein. b) Till further directions in this respect, the assets of these entities shall be utilised only for  the  purposes  of  refund  of  money  and/or  delivery  of  securities,  as  the  case  may be, to the clients/investors of Moongipa Investments Limited under the supervision of the concerned stock exchanges. c) The  banks  and  depositories  are  directed  that  no  debits  shall  be  made in  their  bank accounts/demat accounts, held jointly or severally, except for the above purpose and  after confirmation from the concerned stock exchange in this regard. d) The  concerned  stock  exchanges  and  the  banks  and  depositories  are  directed  to ensure that all the above directions are strictly enforced._______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Moongipa Investments Limited                          3 e) The aforesaid  entities  are  directed  to  provide  a  full  inventory  of  all  their  assets whether  movable  or  immovable,  or  any  interest  or  investment  or  charge  in  any  of such  assets,  including  details  of  their  all  bank  and  demat  accounts  immediately  but not later than 7 working days from the date of receipt of these directions. f) The aforesaid  entities are restrained  from  accessing  the  securities  market  and are further  prohibited from  buying,  selling  or  otherwise  dealing  in  securities,  either.\\\\\\\\u201d 4. Thereafter, SEBI vide order dated February 09, 2019, confirmed the findings in the said interim  order  and inter  alia prohibited  the  Noticee  and  its  directors  from  accessing  the securities market and further prohibited them from buying, selling or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly or being associated with the securities market in any manner whatsoever, for a period of five years. 5. Simultaneously with the aforesaid proceedings, SEBI initiated enquiry proceedings against the Noticee under Chapter V of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 (\"Intermediaries Regulations\") and appointed a Designated Authority (\"DA\") to enquire into  whether the alleged violation of Regulation 8(3)(f) of the SCRR, Regulation 9 read with Clause A(2) and A(5) of the Code of Conduct under the Stock Broker Regulations and SEBI circulars dated November 18, 1993, December 03, 2009 and August 22, 2011 by the Noticee warranted cancellation or suspension of the certificate of registration granted by SEBI or any other action provided in Chapter V of the Intermediaries Regulations.  6. On completion of the proceedings, the DA submitted the report on March 28, 2019 (DA\\\\\\\\u2019s Report) recommending that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s certificate of registration as a stock broker be cancelled. Pursuant to this, a post enquiry SCN dated June 03 2019 was issued to the Noticee, under Regulation 28 (1) of SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008, to show cause as to why action, as recommended by the DA or any other action as considered appropriate by the Designated Member, should not be taken against the Noticee.  A copy of the DA\\\\\\\\u2019s Report was also forwarded to the Noticee along with an advice to file reply, if_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Moongipa Investments Limited                          4 any, within 21 days from the date of receipt of the notice.  The Noticee did not file any reply to this notice. Thereafter, vide notice dated January 21, 2021, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on February 10, 2021. Noticee replied to said notice vide email dated February 09, 2021 stating that they had no additional submissions to make and the matter may be proceeded based on their submissions dated November 27, 2018 made before the DA. The summary of the submissions made before the DA is given below: a. The Noticee met with some financial hardships during the period 2013-14 and 2014-15 due to the fluctuations in the stock market. During mid 2015, when there was a serious liquidity crisis, the directors of the company liquidated their personal assets to pay the liabilities of the clients. However, despite all these efforts, the company could not recover from the liquidity crisis. b. The inspection conducted by SEBI was a surprise inspection and it happened when the Noticee was in the process of shifting its office premises. Because of the shifting process, during the time the inspection was carried out, the back office was not updated and the bank accounts were not reconciled. c. The SEBI team inspected the unreconciled and nonupdated back office data and the interim order was also passed based on the said unreconciled data.  d. None of the complaints made against the Noticee is pending as on date. The complainant\\\\\\\\u2019s were paid by the Exchanges either from the deposit of the Noticee available with the Exchange or from the Investor Protection Fund.  e. The Noticee was under a debt trap on account of losses and liability towards monthly interest payments which needed to be made on loans and advances availed by the Company and was therefore not in a position to fulfil other contractual obligations._______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Moongipa Investments Limited                          5 f. The Noticee and its directors have lost everything and have no assets, either movable or immovable, and since their PAN numbers and bank accounts are also frozen, they are not in a position to carry on any business activity.  CONSIDERATION  7. I have considered the Report submitted by the DA, the Post-Enquiry SCN issued to the Noticee, written submissions made by the Noticee before the DA and other material available on record.  8. The scope of the present proceedings before me is restricted to the enquiry initiated against the Noticee under Chapter V of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 to determine whether the following alleged violations by the Noticee warrant cancellation or suspension of the certificate of registration granted by SEBI or any other action provided under Regulation 27 of the Intermediaries Regulation:  a.

Non-redressal of investor grievances in contravention of the provisions of Regulation 9(e) of the Broker Regulations. 9.

CIR/MIRSD/16/ 2011 dated August 22, 2011 Simplification  and  Rationalization  of  Trading  Account  Opening  Process.  Annexure \\\\\\\\u20134  RIGHTS  AND  OBLIGATIONS  OF  STOCK  BROKERS,  SUB-BROKERS AND CLIENTS as prescribed by SEBI and Stock Exchanges ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS 33. The stock broker shall make pay out of funds or delivery of securities, as the case may be, to the Client within one working day of receipt of the payout from the relevant Exchange where the trade is executed unless otherwise specified by the client and subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the relevant Exchange from time to time where the trade is executed.\\\\\\\\u201d  ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION  Failure to segregate its own and clients' funds and securities 10. SEBI circulars mandate that stock brokers should segregate clients funds/securities from their own funds/securities. Client funds are required to be maintained in separate bank accounts and also required to be recorded separately. Further, stock brokers are not permitted to utilise client funds for meeting their own pay-in obligations. I note from the inspection report that as per the client master data maintained by the Noticee, they had allotted a total of 2555 unique client codes. It was further noted that, during the inspection, in respect of 221 clients there was a net pay-out obligation of Rs. 17.37 crores. The receivables from clients was only Rs. 0.69 crore and therefore there was a net admitted liability of Rs. 16.68 crores towards clients as per the books of accounts of the Noticee.  11. It is further noted from the findings of the NSE inspection, which was communicated to the Noticee vide letter dated May 18, 2015, that a difference of 4,19,134 shares in 169 scrips amounting to Rs. 1,10,94,737, was observed between quantity of securities as per the back office register of securities maintained by the Noticee and the holding statement of the beneficiary account, for the sample dated February 28, 2015.  It was also stated in_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Moongipa Investments Limited                          11 the report that there was non-segregation of transactions between client\\\\\\\\u2019s and own bank accounts and 53 instances were observed where funds were transferred from own bank accounts to client bank accounts.  12. It is further noted from the inspection report that when the inspection team had reached the office of the Noticee, they had witnessed several clients who were present at the office. These clients, as per the IR, were requesting the Noticee to return their funds and securities. It is further recorded in the report that when Madhur Agarwal, director of the Noticee,  was questioned during the inspection regarding the claims of the investors, he had stated that \\\\\\\\u201csome of the client securities were sold by [the Noticee] to meet [their] payin/margin obligations.\\\\\\\\u201d It is also noted from the records that NSE vide its letter dated August 13, 2015 had requested Delhi Police to take appropriate action against MIL for misappropriation of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities. 13. I note from the reply of the Noticee that it has not offered any specific rebuttals to the observations made in the IR regarding misappropriation of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities. It has only stated that the mismatch in data pertaining to the client accounts observed during the SEBI inspection was due to the non-reconciliation of client data during the period when the Noticee was shifting its office. I, however, do not find this explanation to be convincing as the Noticee has failed to provide the \\\\\\\\u2018reconciled data\\\\\\\\u2019 showing the true picture at any point during the course of these proceedings. I also note from the reply that the Noticee has admitted that they have failed to meet contractual payment obligations towards clients due to losses suffered by it. 14. In view of the above, I find that the Noticee has not only failed to segregate own funds and securities from the funds and securities of the clients as mandated under SEBI circulars, but also misappropriated client funds and securities for meeting its own payment obligations and thereby contravened the provisions of SEBI  Circular  SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993 read with Circular No._______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Moongipa Investments Limited                          12 MRD/DoP/SE/Cir-11/2008 dated April 17, 2008 and Circular No. CIR/MIRSD/16/2011 dated August 22, 2011. Indulging in activities other than stock broking business 15. It is noted from the assets/liabilities statement submitted by the Noticee vide letter dated August 03, 2015, that an amount of Rs. 6.30 crores was shown under the head \\\\\\\\u2018Non client loan accounts\\\\\\\\u2019. It is further noted from the IR that as per the Debtor/Creditor statement furnished by the Noticee during the inspection, MIL had taken unsecured loans from 53 entities amounting to Rs. 6.83 crores and was paying an interest in the range of 9%-18% on the said entities. It was also observed that some of the said entities had UCC allotted by the Noticee; however, none of these entities had ever traded through MIL. It was also observed during the inspection from the statement of accounts furnished by the Noticee that the MIL had paid interest to the said clients after deducting TDS.  16. I further note that SEBI had received a complaint, dated May 05, 2016, through the SCORES platform alleging that the complainant who used to trade through the Noticee on the F&O segment was asked maintain the margin money of Rs. 75,50,000 with Noticee with an assurance that interest would be paid on the said amount. It was further alleged that vide letter dated April 24, 2015, Noticee urged the complainant to give a letter in favour of the Noticee stating that the outstanding margin money has been converted into a loan. It was further stated that after July 09, 2015, the Noticee stopped paying interest on the said amount and the complainant has also not got back the principal amount despite repeated requests. I also note that the Noticee has stated in its reply that \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticee Company was under a debt trap on account of losses and liability towards monthly interest being paid by the company on loans/advances.\\\\\\\\u201d 17. In view of the above, I am of the view that the Noticee was accepting money in the nature of deposits/loans from clients and other entities and was paying interest on the said_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Moongipa Investments Limited                          13 amounts. I note that rule 8(3)(f) of the SCRR prohibits registered stock brokers from engaging in any activity or business involving personal financial liability, other than stock broking business. In view of the same, I hold that the Noticee by engaging in accepting deposits/loans from clients and other entities, engaged in activities involving financial liability, that was not incidental to its activities as a stock broker and thereby contravened Rule 8(3)(f) of the SCRR) and Clause A(2) and A(5) of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 9 of the Broker Regulations. Periodic Settlement of Client Accounts 18. I note from the IR that it was observed during the inspection that the Noticee was not settling the accounts of its clients periodically as mandated under SEBI circulars MIRSD/SE/Cir-19/2009 dated December 03, 2009 and SEBI/MIRSD/Cir-01/2011 dated May 13, 2011. It was further noted that Noticee had given an undertaking dated August 02, 2015 stating that 70% of the accounts were being settled periodically. I, however, note that no proof has been given by the Noticee to substantiate the said claim.  19. It is noted that SEBI circular dated December 03, 2009 prescribes that unless otherwise specifically authorised by a client in writing to maintain a running account, the stock broker has to settle the accounts within 24 hours of the pay-in/pay-out. I note from the IR that it was observed during the inspection that accounts of certain clients were not even settled once during the period April 01, 2014 \\\\\\\\u2013 August 03, 2015. Further, even if the undertaking dated August 02, 2015, given by the Noticee, is taken at face value, it would still remain that accounts of 30% of clients are not being settled periodically as mandated under the SEBI circulars.  20. In view of the above, I have no hesitation in holding that the Noticee has failed to periodically settle client accounts within the timelines prescribed under the SEBI circulars_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Moongipa Investments Limited                          14 MIRSD/SE/Cir-19/2009 dated December 03, 2009 and SEBI/MIRSD/Cir-01/2011 dated May 13, 2011. Non-redressal of investor grievances  21. I note from the information available on record that as on August 04, 2015, 22 complaints for cumulative claim amount of Rs. 1.24 crores  were pending against the Noticee on the SCORES platform. I note from the reply filed by the Noticee that it has not denied that these complaints were pending at the time these proceedings were initiated against the Noticee. Instead the Noticee has tried to rely on resolution of the complaints through the Investor Grievance Redressal Panel (IGRP) of the NSE and the Investor Redressal Grievance Committee (IGRC) of BSE and payments made to the complainants from the Investor Protection Fund maintained by the exchanges and security deposit and other funds of the Noticee available with the exchanges, to claim that no complaints are pending as on date. I am, however, unable to accept this contention raised by the Noticee as the resolution of a complaint through stock exchange dispute resolution mechanism does not exonerate an intermediary from its liability cast under the SEBI regulations for failure to satisfactorily redress investor grievance. On the contrary, the very fact that an investor had to approach the stock exchange dispute resolution framework is confirmation of the fact that the Noticee had failed to satisfactorily redress investor grievances.  22. I note that Regulations (e) of the Stock Broker Regulations provides as one of the conditions of registration that the broker \\\\\\\\u201cshall take adequate steps for redressal of grievances, of the investor within one month of the date of receipt of the complaint.\\\\\\\\u201d In view of the same, I hold that the Noticee has failed to satisfactorily redress investor grievances as mandated under Regulation 9(e) of the Broker Regulations.  23. It is further noted from the records that the Noticee was expelled by NSE on November 09, 2015 and the BSE had declared MIL as a defaulter on September 30, 2015, for non-_______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Moongipa Investments Limited                          15 compliance with the orders of the IGRP and IGRC. These orders related to complaints preferred by the clients of the Noticee alleging misappropriation/non-transfer of securities and funds.   24. In view of the above, I agree with the findings of the DA that the Noticee has violated the provisions of the SEBI Act, the SCRR, the Broker Regulations and the circulars made there under as detailed in the paragraphs 14, 17, 20 and 22 of this Order.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as 'SEBI'), had, pursuant to a preliminary enquiry into possible non-compliances with public issue norms stipulated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 including Sections 56, 60 and 73 thereof by the company, Alchemist Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as 'Alchemist' or 'the Company') in respect of its offer of Redeemable Preference Shares (hereinafter referred to as 'RPS'), issued an ex-parte interim order dated September 20, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as 'the interim order') against the Company and its directors including Mr. Sunil Kanti Kar, Mr. Brij Mohan Mahajan, Mr. Balvir Singh, Mr. Sukrit Sood, Ms. Ashima Sood,  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 2 of 24 Mr. Vikramaditya Singh and Mr. Chandra Shekhar Chauhan. 2. Subsequently, SEBI passed a Final Order bearing no. WTM/PS/38/NRO/AUG/2015 dated August 14, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \"Final Order\") against Alchemist Holdings Limited and the Directors, viz. Mr. Brij Mohan Mahajan [DIN: 00031819], Mr. Vikramaditya Singh [DIN: 01865565] and Mr. Chandra Shekhar Chauhan [DIN: 02517955], for the non-compliances with the public issue norms stipulated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956, including Sections 56, 60 and 73 thereof, by the company, Alchemist Holdings Limited in respect of offer of RPS. 3. The aforesaid Final Order inter alia made the following findings and directions: Findings in Brief : 3.1. The Company was incorporated as Mahindra Finlease Pvt. Limited on December 22, 1995, its name was subsequently changed to Alchemist Holdings Pvt. Limited on December 17, 2005, and thereafter to Alchemist Holdings Limited on February 01, 2006. The Company Mahindra Finlease Pvt. Limited was granted a certificate of registration under Section 45IA of the RBI Act on September 11, 2000 to act as Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC). After the change of name the Company was granted another certificate of registration dated May 02, 2006. 3.2. NBFCs and PFIs, though may be exempted from the limit of 49 persons, they still require to comply with the clauses (a) and (b) to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956. Therefore, in a case involving an NBFC or a PFI, it has to be proved that their offer or invitation did not result, directly or indirectly, in the securities becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation or such offer or invitation was a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer or invitation 3.3. From the list of investors as provided by the Company, it is noted that there is nothing on record to show that the subscription by the persons was on receipt of offer/ invitation or these were domestic concern. It is seen that the investors were from various walks i.e., agriculture, service, professional, business,  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 3 of 24 retired, housewife, others, etc. SEBI had taken a prima facie view in the interim order that the offer or invitation made by the Company was not a private placement and that such offer was made to the general public. The same has not been disproved by the Company. The Company did not produce documents as sought by SEBI and thus failed to substantiate its contention that its allotment was on private placement as provided under Section 67(3)(a) and (b) of the Companies Act, 1956. In view of the above, I conclude that the offer and allotment of RPS made by the Company during the Financial Years 2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, was a 'public issue'. The dates of allotment, number of allottees and funds mobilized has been collated from documents obtained from MCA 21 (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) portal i.e. FORM 2 (Return of allotment). 3.4. With reference to the contention of the Company on Financial Stability Report of the RBI in 2010 and the Circulars issued by RBI in the year 2013, on exemption of NBFC from the provision of section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956 [i.e. second proviso to section 67(3)], it was noted that the report does not state that NBFCs are exempt from satisfying clauses (a) & (b) to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956. Therefore, an NBFC, prior to June 27, 2013, had to have enough proof that its issue was on private placement satisfying clauses (a) and (b) of Section 67(3) of the Companies Act and from June 27, 2013 onwards had to comply with the restriction of allotting to not more than 49 in a private placement. 3.5. Also the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s contention that SEBI advertisement dated November 15, 2013 had stated that \\\\\\\\u201cSchemes/Arrangements made or offered by Cooperative Societies, deposits accepted by NBFCs ..... are outside the purview of SEBI's jurisdiction\\\\\\\\u201f. It was noted that the SEBI advertisement refers only to the \\\\\\\\u201cdeposits\\\\\\\\u201f by NBFCs and not offer or issuance of securities by NBFCs. NBFCs also have restraints in respect of the offer and issuance of securities to the public and these have to necessarily comply with the public issue norms mandated under the Companies Act, 1956 and the SEBI Act.  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 4 of 24 3.6. In view of the above, it was concluded that the Company had made a public issue of RPS as alleged in the interim order and confirmed the findings that the issue of RPS was a \\\\\\\\u201cpublic issue\\\\\\\\u201f of such securities in terms of the first proviso to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956. Having arrived at a conclusion that the Company had made a public issue of securities, it was under an obligation to comply with the Companies Act, 1956, SEBI Act, and the rules, regulations and guidelines framed thereunder which regulate the public issue of equity shares. 3.7. The issue of RPS was a \\\\\\\\u201cpublic issue\\\\\\\\u201d of securities in terms of the first proviso to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956. The company raised at least an amount of \\\\\\\\u20b9 444.67 crores from 4,26,676 allottees through the public issue and was under an obligation to comply with the Companies Act, 1956, SEBI Act, and the rules, regulations and guidelines framed thereunder which regulate the public issue of equity shares.  3.8. The Company admittedly neither issued any prospectus in relation to shares nor has it offered the same for public subscription. The Company has not provided any proof to show that it applied for listing permission from a stock exchange. The Company admitted that it did not file any 'prospectus' with respect to its offer and allotment of RPS.  3.9. The above said Offer of RPS was found to be a deemed public issue of securities under the first proviso to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956. Accordingly, it was held that the resultant requirements under Section 60, Section 56(1) and 56(3), Sections 73(1), (2) and (3) of the Companies Act, 1956, were not complied with by the Company. 3.10. The interim order and the hearing letters issued to Mr. Balvir Singh, Mr. Sukrit Sood, Ms. Ashima Sood and Mr. Sunil Kanti Kar (collectively referred hereinafter as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d) returned undelivered. It is seen from the Article of Association and the Memorandum of Association filed with Registrar of Companies (RoC) that, Ms. Ashima Sood was the original subscribers of the equity share capital of the Company and was also one of the directors of the  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 5 of 24 Company. Ms. Ashima Sood and Mr. Sukrit Sood had resigned from the Company on April 01, 2006, i.e. after the first tranche of allotment of RPS to public on March 25, 2006. 3.11. Mr. Brij Mohan Mahajan, Mr. Vikramaditya Singh and Mr. Chandra Shekhar Chauhan, being the persons in-charge of the affairs and policies of the Company, were responsible for the contraventions committed by the Company and are the 'officers in default' and liable in terms of Section 73(2) of the Companies Act, 1956, to make the repayments to investors.  Relevant Directions  3.12. In view of the violations committed by the Company and the Directors, to safeguard the interest of the investors who had subscribed to such preference shares issued by the Company and to further ensure orderly development of securities market, appropriate directions were issued against the Company and Mr. Brij Mohan Mahajan, Mr. Vikramaditya Singh, Mr. Chandra Shekhar Chauhan Mr. Krishna Kumar Singh and Rajiv Kumar Nayar, which are contained in paragraph 29 of the Final Order, including direction to refund the money collected by the Company through the issuance of RPS, including the money collected from investors, till date of passing of the final order, pending allotment of NCD, if any, with an interest of 15% per annum compounded at half yearly intervals, from the date when the repayments became due to the investors till the date of actual payment.  3.13. To take appropriate steps to complete the service of the interim order on Mr. Sunil Kanti Kar, Mr. Sukrit Sood, Ms. Ashima Sood and Mr. Balvir Singh, and proceed further. In view of the same, the interim directions issued vide the interim order dated September 20, 2013, against these persons shall continue in force. 4.  The following directions were issued in the said interim order dated September 20, 2013, with immediate effect against the Noticees in the interim order; 4.1. Mr. Balvir Singh [DIN: 00139599], Mr. Sukrit Sood [DIN: 00084077], Ms. Ashima Sood [DIN : 00037854] and Mr. Suil Kanti Kar [DIN : 00476819] are  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 6 of 24 hereby directed not to collect any money from investor till further orders  4.2. Mr. Balvir Singh, Mr. Sukrit Sood, Ms. Ashima Sood and Mr. Suil Kanti Kar, to show cause as to why appropriate actions under SEBI Act should not be taken/issued against them for non-compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act including sections 56, 60, 69 and 73 of the Companies Act. 5. Vide the said interim order, Mr. Balvir Singh, Mr. Sukrit Sood, Ms. Ashima Sood and Mr. Suil Kanti Kar, were also given the opportunity to file reply, within 15 days from the date of receipt of the said interim order. The order further stated that he may also indicate whether they wish to avail an opportunity of personal hearing in the matter.  6. Subsequently, an appeal bearing Appeal No. 423 of 2015 was filed by the Company and Mr. Chandra Shekhar Chauhan, against the final order. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT) vide order dated June 28, 2018, upheld all the findings and directions of the final order except deleting \\\\\\\\u2018compounded at half yearly intervals\\\\\\\\u2019. 7. Service of Interim Order and Personal Hearing: The letters forwarding the interim order to Mr. Sunil Kanti Kar, Mr. Balvir Singh, Mr. Sukrit Sood and Ms. Ashima Sood returned undelivered. Therefore, the letters of these persons were forwarded to the Company for onward delivery to the respective directors. An opportunity of personal hearing was also granted on June 20, 2014. The notices for the hearing issued to Mr. Balvir Singh, Mr. Sukrit Sood, Ms. Ashima Sood, Mr. Vikramaditya Singh and Mr. Sunil Kanti Kar, returned undelivered and therefore the same was forwarded to the Company for onward delivery to the Noticees. The Company vide its letter dated June 02, 2014, replied that Mr. Sunil Kanti Kar had expired. However, no death certificate was submitted. As regards, other Noticees namely Mr. Sukrit Sood and Mr. Balvir Singh, the Company replied that they had ceased to be the directors of the Company since April 01, 2006 and October 15, 2013, respectively. As regards, Ms. Ashima Sood it was submitted that she also ceased to be the director of the Company.  8. Thereafter, vide notification dated March 02, 2021, published in newspapers on  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 7 of 24 March 10, 2021, in Times of India-Kolkata Edition; Sanmarg-Kolkata Edition and Sangbad Pratidin-Kolkata Edition, The Times of India-Delhi Edition, Dainik Jagran-Delhi Edition, The Tribune-Chandigard Edition, Dainik Bhaskar-Chandigarh Edition and Rozana Spokesman-Chandigarh Edition, the Noticees were notified by SEBI, that interim order dated September 20, 2013 was issued against the Noticees and was advised to download the interim order copy from the website of SEBI (www.sebi.gov.in) or collect the copy of said interim order from respective SEBI offices or obtain by sending email to the emails id provided in the notification. Further, the Noticees were also notified that an opportunity of hearing has also been granted on April 01, 2021 at 3.00 Pm through webex. 9. It is noted that the Noticees have neither submitted a reply in the matter nor attended the scheduled hearing in the matter.  Consideration of Issues and Findings 10. It is noted that the Company made an appeal to Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT against the SEBI final order dated August 14, 2015. Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT vide its order dated June 29, 2018, upheld all the findings and directions of the final order with the following, \\\\\\\\u2026..while upholding the impugned orders passed by the WTM of SEBI on 14.08.2015 and 03.08.2015 we delete the direction given by the WTM of SEBI to pay interest \\\\\\\\u2018compounded at half yearly intervals\\\\\\\\u2019.  11. Thereafter, an appeal was filed by the Company before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India and vide order dated November 25, 2019, the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Tribunal was upheld. 12. I have considered the allegations and materials available on record. On perusal of the same, the following issues arise for consideration. Each question is dealt with separately under different headings. 12.1. Issue No. 1 - Whether the company came out with the Offer of RPS? 12.2. Issue No. 2 - If so, whether the said offer was in violation of Section 56, Section 60 and Section 73 of Companies Act 1956? 12.3. Issue No. 3 - If the findings on the aforesaid issue no. 2 are found in the  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 8 of 24 affirmative, whether the Noticee is liable for the violations committed? Issue No. 1- Whether the company came out with the Offer of RPS? 13. I have perused the interim order and I note that the Noticees have not filed any reply disputing the same.  14. Further, the Company has admitted to the offer of Redeemable Preference Shares during the Financial Years 2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cOffer of RPS\\\\\\\\u201d) and raising an amount of \\\\\\\\u20b9 444.67 crores from 4,26,676 allottees. The dates of allotment, number of allottees and funds mobilized has also been collated from documents obtained from MCA 21 portal i.e. FORM 2 (Return of allotment).  15. I therefore conclude that the company came out with an offer of RPS as outlined above. The same finding has been concluded in the final order also. Issue No. 2- If so, whether the said offer was in violation of Section 56, Section 60 and Section 73 of Companies Act 1956. 16. The provisions alleged to have been violated and mentioned in Issue No. 2 are applicable to the Offer of RPS made to the public. Therefore, the primary question that arises for consideration is whether the issue of RPS is a \\\\\\\\u2018public issue\\\\\\\\u2019. At this juncture, reference may be made to Sections 67(1) and 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956:   \"67. (1) Any reference in this Act or in the articles of a company to offering shares or debentures to the public shall, subject to any provision to the contrary contained in this Act and subject also to the provisions of sub-sections (3) and (4), be construed as including a reference to offering them to any section of the public, whether selected as members or debenture holders of the company concerned or as clients of the person issuing the prospectus or in any other manner.  (2) any reference in this Act or in the articles of a company to invitations to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures shall, subject as aforesaid, be construed as including a reference to invitations to subscribe for them extended to any section of the public, whether selected as members or debenture holders  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 9 of 24 of the company concerned or as clients of the person issuing the prospectus or in any other manner.  (3) No offer or invitation shall be treated as made to the public by virtue of sub- section (1) or sub- section (2), as the case may be, if the offer or invitation can properly be regarded, in all the circumstances-  (a) as not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation; or (b) otherwise as being a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer or invitation \\\\\\\\u2026 Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall apply in a case where the offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or debentures is made to fifty persons or more:  Provided further that nothing contained in the first proviso shall apply to nonbanking financial companies or public financial institutions specified in section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956).\\\\\\\\u201d  17. The following observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited & Ors. vs. SEBI (Civil Appeal no. 9813 and 9833 of 2011) (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cSahara Case\\\\\\\\u201d), while examining the scope of Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956, are worth consideration: -  \\\\\\\\u201cSection 67(1) deals with the offer of shares and debentures to the public and Section 67(2) deals with invitation to the public to subscribe for shares and debentures and how those expressions are to be understood, when reference is made to the Act or in the articles of a company. The emphasis in Section 67(1) and (2) is on the \\\\\\\\u201csection of the public\\\\\\\\u201d. Section 67(3) states that no offer or invitation shall be treated as made to the public, by virtue of subsections (1) and (2), that is to any section of the public, if the offer or invitation is not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation or otherwise as being a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer or invitations. Section 67(3) is, therefore, an exception to Sections 67(1) and (2). If the circumstances mentioned in clauses (1) and (b) of  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 10 of 24 Section 67(3) are satisfied, then the offer/invitation would not be treated as being made to the public.   The first proviso to Section 67(3) was inserted by the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2000 w.e.f. 13.12.2000, which clearly indicates, nothing contained in Sub-section (3) of Section 67 shall apply in a case where the offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or debentures is made to fifty persons or more. \\\\\\\\u2026 Resultantly, after 13.12.2000, any offer of securities by a public company to fifty persons or more will be treated as a public issue under the Companies Act, even if it is of domestic concern or it is proved that the shares or debentures are not available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation.\\\\\\\\u201d  18. Section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956 provides for situations when an offer is not considered as offer to public. As per the said sub section, if the offer is one which is not calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation, or, if the offer is the domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer, the same are not considered as public offer. Under such circumstances, they are considered as private placement of shares and debentures. It is noted that as per the first proviso to Section 67(3) Companies Act, 1956, the public offer and listing requirements contained in that Act would become automatically applicable to a company making the offer to fifty or more persons. However, the second proviso to Section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956 exempts NBFCs and Public Financial Institutions from the applicability of the first proviso.  19. In the present matter, I find that offer of RPS were made by the company to mobilize an amount of \\\\\\\\u20b9 444.67 crores from 4,26,676 allottees during FY 2005 to 2009. Further, the Company, being an NBFC, has admittedly made an offer of RPS and allotted 44,46,72,800 RPS to 4,26,676 persons during the Financial Years 2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008 and 2008-2009. These offers of RPS and allotments as per the Company were made pursuant to the grant of a certificate of registration from the RBI to act as an NBFC. Therefore, for the  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 11 of 24 Company in order to claim that it had made a \\\\\\\\u201cprivate placement\\\\\\\\u201f of such securities, it has to show that it had complied with either clause (a) or (b) of Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956 and further prove that its case fell within the ambit of either of the said clauses.  20. I note here that, the Financial Stability Report (FSR) of the RBI of 2010 records that NBFCs are exempt from the provisions of Section 67 of the Companies Act and that RBI was in the process of formulating guidelines in conjunction with the MCA to plug the contemporaneous regulatory gap;  - the issuance of RBI circulars dated June 27, 2013 and July 02, 2013, for NBFCs made it clear that no restrictions were applicable at the time when the Company issued the RPS. FSR of the RBI vide the following paragraphs no., states that:  5.62 NBFCs are exempt from the provisions of Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956, in terms of which issuance of shares/debentures to more than 49 investors needs to be through public issuance. This means that NBFCs, particularly those not regulated by the Reserve Bank, could issue debt or quasi-debt instruments to a large number of retail/institutional investors on a private placement basis. This would be tantamount to raising public deposits outside the extant regulatory framework. 5.63 Specific concerns in this regard have arisen in the past in the context of private placement of Convertible Preference Shares (CPS) by few NBFCs.\" 21. It can be noted that the focus is on the exemption to NBFCs from the provisions of Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956 [i.e. second proviso to section 67(3)]. The report does not state that NBFCs are also exempt from satisfying clauses (a) & (b) to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956. NBFC, prior to June 27, 2013, had to have enough proof that its issue was on private placement satisfying clauses (a) and (b) of Section 67(3) of the Companies Act and from June 27, 2013 onwards had to comply with the restriction of allotting to not more than 49 in a private placement. NBFCs also have restraints in respect of the offer and issuance of securities to the public and these have to necessarily comply with the public  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 12 of 24 issue norms mandated under the Companies Act, 1956 and the SEBI Act. Further there is no material on record to substantiate that allotment was on private placement as provided under Section 67(3)(a) and (b) of the Companies Act, 1956. In view of the above, it is concluded that the offer and allotment of RPS made by the Company during the Financial Years 2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, was a 'public issue'. The same is also concluded in the final order. 22. Further Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT vide its order dated June 29, 2018, in this matter upheld the final order findings and held that, \\\\\\\\u2026 there is no provision in the 1956 Act which excludes NBFCs from the provisions contained in the 1956 Act. Even the second proviso to Section 67(3) does not exempt NBFCs from the provisions contained in the 1956 Act. In fact the second proviso to Section 67(3) simply provides that the first proviso which provides that an offer or invitation of a company to fifty persons or more persons receiving the offer/ invitation shall be treated to be an offer/ invitation made to public shall not be applicable to NBFCs. It obviously means that the offer/invitation made by NBFCs to more than 49 persons shall not be treated to have been made to the public, provided, the offer/invitation is only to the persons receiving the offer/ invitations. 23. Therefore, in view of the material available on record, I find that the Offer of RPS by the Company is deemed as public issue as there is no proof that, issue was on private placement as provided under Section 67(3)(a) and (b) of the Companies Act, 1956. Therefore, company was mandated to comply with the 'public issue' norms as prescribed under the Companies Act, 1956. The same has also been decided vide Final Order. Further Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT has also held in this matter vide its order dated June 29, 2018 that,\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u201cIn the present case, since the offer/ invitation of the company was not restricted to the persons to whom the offer/ invitation was made, the WTM of SEBI was justified in holding that the company had made the offer to the public without following the provisions applicable to public offer under the 1956 Act.\\\\\\\\u201d 24. In view of the RPS by the Company being \\\\\\\\u2018public issue\\\\\\\\u2019, Section 60 of the Companies Act, thereof, mandates a company to register its 'prospectus' with the  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 13 of 24 RoC, before making a public offer/ issuing the 'prospectus'. Further as per the section 2(36) of the Companies Act, 1956, \\\\\\\\u201cprospectus\\\\\\\\u201d means any document described or issued as a prospectus and includes any notice, circular, advertisement or other document inviting deposits from the public or inviting offers from the public for the subscription or purchase of any shares in, or debentures of, a body corporate. As the offer of RPS was a deemed public issue of securities, the company was required to register a prospectus with the RoC under Section 60 of the Companies Act, 1956.  25. Further, in terms of Section 56(1) of the Companies Act, 1956, every prospectus issued by or on behalf of a company, shall state the matters specified in Part I and set out the reports specified in Part II of Schedule II of that Act. Further, as per Section 56(3) of the Companies Act, 1956, no one shall issue any form of application for shares in a company, unless the form is accompanied by abridged prospectus, containing disclosures as specified. I find that, the Company had admitted that it did not file any 'prospectus' with respect to its offer and allotment of RPS, and therefore the Company has contravened the above provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. I, therefore, find that the company has not complied with the provisions of Section 56 of the Companies Act, 1956. The same has also been decided vide Final Order. 26. Since the offer of RPS was public issue of securities, such securities shall also have to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, as mandated under Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956. As per Sections 73(1) and (2) of the Companies Act, 1956, a company is required to make an application to one or more recognized stock exchanges for permission for the shares or debentures to be offered to be dealt with in the stock exchange and if permission has not been applied for or not granted, the company is required to forthwith repay with interest all moneys received from the application. However, it was observed from the Annual Report for the financial year 2012-2013 of the Company, that 44,16,46,610 RPS amounting to \\\\\\\\u20b9441.64 crores were outstanding as on March 31, 2012. Further recovery proceeding and necessary action in terms of the final order directions have been initiated against the Company and the respective directors mentioned  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 14 of 24 in the final order. 27. From the above it is noted that there is no material available on record to substantiate the following, 27.1. The allotment by the company being an NBFC was on private placement as provided under Section 67(3)(a) and (b) of the Companies Act  27.2. Prospectus in relation to RPS was issued and registered with the RoC as per section 56 and 60 read with 2(36) of the Companies Act 27.3. The company has made an application seeking listing permission from any recognized stock exchange as per section 73(1) of the Companies Act 27.4. The amount collected through the RPS issues has been refunded to the investors with interest within the stipulated time as per section 73(2). 27.5. The amount collected by the RPS issue is kept in a separate bank account as per section 73(3) of the Companies Act Therefore, I find that the company has contravened provisions contained in section 56, 60, 67, and 73 of the companies Act. The same has also been decided vide Final Order.  28. With respect to the jurisdiction of SEBI over various provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 including the above mentioned provisions, in the case of public companies, whether listed or unlisted, when they issue and transfer securities, flows from the provisions of Section 55A of the Companies Act, 1956. While examining the scope of Section 55A of the Companies Act, 1956, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Sahara Case, held that:  \"We, therefore, hold that, so far as the provisions enumerated in the opening portion of Section 55A of the Companies Act, so far as they relate to issue and transfer of securities and non-payment of dividend is concerned, SEBI has the power to administer in the case of listed public companies and in the case of those public companies which intend to get their securities listed on a recognized stock exchange in India.\"  Order in the matter of Alchemist Holdings Limited                                     Page 15 of 24 \"SEBI can exercise its jurisdiction under Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11A(1)(b) and 11B of SEBI Act and Regulation 107 of ICDR 2009 over public companies who have issued shares or debentures to fifty or more, but not complied with the provisions of Section 73(1) by not listing its securities on a recognized stock exchange\"  29. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that by virtue of Section 55A of the Companies Act, 1956, SEBI has to administer Section 67 of Companies Act, so far as it relates to issue and transfer of securities, in the case of companies who intend to get their securities listed. While interpreting the phrase \\\\\\\\u201cintend to get listed\\\\\\\\u201d in the context of deemed public issue the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in Sahara Case observed-  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026But then, there is also one simple fundamental of law, i.e. that no-one can be presumed or deemed to be intending something, which is contrary to law.

The present proceedings have emanated from a show cause notice dated January 20, 2021 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) issued by Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) to M/s. Shri Research Services, and its sole proprietor i.e. Mr. Gourav Kumar Gour, (hereinafter collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticees\\\\\\\\u201d), alleging that the Noticees have carried out investment advisory activities without obtaining a certificate of registration from SEBI, in prima facie violation of provisions of Sections 12(1) and 12A (a), (b), (c) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \"SEBI Act, 1992\"), Regulation 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations, 2003\\\\\\\\u201d), and Regulation 3(1) of SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations, 2013\\\\\\\\u201d).   2. The allegations made in the SCN are as under:  a. SEBI had received a complaint dated February 02, 2018 against M/s. ShriFinal Order against Shri Research Services (Proprietor: Gourav Kumar Gour) Page 2 of 12  Research Services, wherein it was inter alia alleged that the complainant had received call from the Noticees for taking investment advisory services and he thereafter, deposited Rs. 12,000/- for investment advisory services but had not got any service. Based on the same, an examination of the complaint was carried out by SEBI.  b. From the KYC and confirmation obtained from Axis Bank Ltd., it was observed that Mr. Gourav Kumar Gour was the sole Proprietor of SRS   c. From the analysis of the bank account statement of Axis Bank Account- 916020044292311 of the Noticees, it is noted that credit of Rs. 14,63,061 have been received for the period January 01, 2018 \\\\\\\\u2013 July 12, 2018.   d. From the analysis of said bank statements, it is revealed that the Noticees had collected fees directly from clients in its bank account. The fees of Rs. 12,000 which the complainant had alleged to have paid, is noticed in the Axis bank statement on January 22, 2018.   e. Further, Mr. Gourav Kumar Gour in his letter dated April 10, 2018 had accepted providing tips in stock markets to its clients, which he has since stopped. He had further stated that he was using the name of \\\\\\\\u2018Alpha Investment Research\\\\\\\\u2019 to provide tips to clients and was giving 30% to the said entity. Mr. Gourav Kumar Gour also submitted letters dated April 06, 2018 from its 5 employees namely- Anil Nimbola, Sangeeta Gargo, Rahul Parmar, Sapna Bhargav and Prahlad Chauhan, in which they had stated that, \\\\\\\\u2018We are employees of SRS, which had taken franchisee of Alpha Investment Research and was providing services in share market\\\\\\\\u2019.   3. The SCN also called upon the Noticees to show cause as to why suitable directions under Sections 11(1), 11(4), and 11B(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 should not be issued against them for alleged violations. The Noticees were further called upon to show cause as to why inquiry should not be held against them in terms of Rule 4 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cRules\\\\\\\\u201d) and penalty be not imposed under Section 11 (4A), 11 B(2)Final Order against Shri Research Services (Proprietor: Gourav Kumar Gour) Page 3 of 12  for violation of Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013 and Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  4. The SCN also provided to the Noticees an opportunity to file their objections/reply, if any, within 21 days from the receipt of the notice. I note that the SCN could not be delivered at the last known address available with SEBI, even though letters issued during examination was delivered to the Noticees at the same address to which they had responded vide letter dated April 10, 2018 to SEBI. Accordingly, the SCN was served through newspaper publication on March 15, 2021 in the Times of India, Indore (English Edition) and Dainik Bhaskar, Indore (Hindi Edition), having  circulation in the locality of last  known addresses of the Noticees. Vide the same newspaper publication on March 15, 2021, opportunity of personal hearing was also granted to the Noticees on April 27, 2021. However, on April 27, 2021, the Noticees did not appear for the hearing and neither did they file any letter seeking adjournment. I also note that the Noticees did not file any reply/objections to the SCN. Hence, I shall now proceed to examine the matter on the basis of the material available on record.   5. I note that the definition of investment adviser, as given in Regulation 2(1)(m) of IA Regulations, 2013, provides that investment adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Regulation 2(1) (l) of the IA Regulations defines investment advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d   6. I note that during examination of the complaint received in the matter by SEBI, Mr. Gourav Gour in his letter dated April 10, 2018 to SEBI, had accepted providing tips in stock markets to its clients, which he claimed he had since stopped. In the said letter, Shri Gourav Gour also admitted that he owned Shri Research Services which is franchisee of Alpha Investment. Mr. Gourav Gour, in his another letter of the sameFinal Order against Shri Research Services (Proprietor: Gourav Kumar Gour) Page 4 of 12  date i.e. April 10, 2018, had inter alia submitted that he has closed down Shri Research Services through which it used to give investment advice to investors, by using the name of Alpha Investment Research with which he had a goodwill use arrangement for which he used to pay 30% of the fees/commission charged from investors to Alpha Investment Research. He had further stated that he was using the name of \\\\\\\\u2018Alpha Investment Research\\\\\\\\u2019 to provide tips to clients and was giving 30% to the said entity. Further, I note that he had submitted letter dated April 06, 2018 from its 5 employees namely- Anil Nimbola, Sangeeta Gargo, Rahul Parmar, Sapna Bhargav and Prahlad Chauhan, in which they had stated that, \\\\\\\\u2018We are employees of SRS, which had taken franchisee of Alpha Investment Research and was providing services in share market\\\\\\\\u2019. I also note that complaint was filed with SEBI by one Mr. Vinod Pareek alleging that he had received call from Shri Research Services for taking investment advisory services and he thereafter, deposited Rs. 12,000/- for investment advisory services but had not got any service. I note that Mr. Gourav Gour has also submitted statements of bank account of Shri Research Services held with with Axis Bank having number 916020044292311. KYC documents of said bank account, as received from Axis Bank, also shows that Shri Research Services is the sole proprietary concern of Shri Gourav Gour.   7. From the details of the said bank account, it is further noted that credits of Rs. 14,63,061/- have been received for the period January 01, 2018 \\\\\\\\u2013 July 12, 2018. The bank account statement of said account also shows credit of amount of Rs. 12,000/- of the complainant. From the aforesaid facts, I find that the Noticees were engaged in giving advice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, in lieu of consideration. In terms of Regulation 2(1) (l) of IA Regulations, 2013 such an advice is \\\\\\\\u201cinvestment advice\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Noticees were engaged in the business of providing investment advice to public, for consideration and were thus, acting as an investment adviser, as defined under Regulation 2(1) (m) of the IA Regulations, 2013.     8. Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 provides as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investmentFinal Order against Shri Research Services (Proprietor: Gourav Kumar Gour) Page 5 of 12  adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  9. In order to protect the interest of investors and to maintain integrity of the securities market, IA Regulations, 2013 provides safeguards to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected. One such safeguard is that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to obtain registration from SEBI as required under Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013. Regulation 3(1) provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of IA Regulations. Further, safeguards provided under IA Regulations, 2013 includes continued minimum professional qualification and net-worth requirement for investment adviser, disclosure of all conflict of interest, prohibition on entering into transactions which are contrary to advice given for 15 days, risk profiling of investors, maintaining documented process for selecting investment for client based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s objective and risk profile, understanding the nature and risks of products or assets selected for clients, etc.   10. The activities of the Noticees, as admitted by Mr. Gourav Gour and as can be made out from the material available on record, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 and IA Regulations, 2013, show that the Noticees were acting as an investment adviser. However, it is noted that Shri Research Services is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of Investment Advisor. Hence, I find that these activities carried on by the Noticees without holding a certificate of registration as investment adviser are in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013.  11. SCN also alleges that Noticees have violated Section 12A (a), (b), (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. In this regard, I note that Noticee have been found to be engaged in giving advice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investmentFinal Order against Shri Research Services (Proprietor: Gourav Kumar Gour) Page 6 of 12  products, in lieu of consideration and in this context one complaint from one Shri Mr. Vinod Pareek, alleging payment of Rs. 12,000/- to Shri Research Services has also been referred. I note that Section 12A(a), (b), (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 deals with fraud related to securities market and the provisions of Regulations 3(b), (c) & (d), of PFUTP Regulations, 2003 are also related to securities market fraud/manipulation/ unfair trade practices. Section 12A (a), (b) & (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 may be invoked in cases where there exists any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, any device, scheme or artifice to defraud or any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, purchase, sale or dealing, of any securities. It is noted that after February 01, 2019, acts which may be knowingly designed to influence the decision of investors in securities, have been made as part of dealing in securities as defined under Regulation 2(1)(b) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. In case of Investment Advice the Investment Adviser has to give advice after risk profiling and taking into consideration the suitability of the product. However, the investor may or may not accept the advice and has the full option to go by the advice of the Investment Adviser or not. I note that in his letter dated April 10, 2018 Mr. Gourav Gour has submitted that Noticees have stopped giving investment advice. I note that the material available on record does not suggest anything to the contrary. Therefore, violations of Section 12A (a), (b) & (c) Regulations 3(b), (c) & (d), of PFUTP Regulations, 2003 may not be attracted in the present case. I note that there is no allegation in the SCN that the Noticees were having any website for providing any investment advisory service. I note that in terms of Regulation 4(2) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003, as existing at the relevant time, dealing in securities shall be deemed to be fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include an advertisement that is misleading or that contains information in a distorted manner and which may influence the decision of the investors. In the present case, material available on record does not point out that Noticees had issued any advertisement regarding their investment advisory services. It is noted that in one of the letter dated April 06, 2018 by SEBI to the Noticees, it has been mentioned that Noticees were operating a website i.e. www.shriresearchservices.com, however, further proof of operating such website like printouts of the webpages showing the content of the website such as showing rendering of investment advisory services by Shri Research Services, or holdingFinal Order against Shri Research Services (Proprietor: Gourav Kumar Gour) Page 7 of 12  himself as registered Investment Adviser, payment options for availing such advice like bank account/payment gateways, etc. where advisory fees could be paid for availing services, are not available on record. The complaint received from one Mr. Vinod Pareek in the matter though mentions that the complainant had paid Rs. 12,000/- to Shri Research Services, however, it does not mention the name of any website. Therefore, even the provisions of Regulation 4(2) (k) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003 may not be attracted in the present case.    12. I note that the material available on record does not indicate the exact amount of fees collected by the Noticees,  as  a  result  of  providing  investment  advice  to investors,  in  violation  of  the  provisions  of  the  IA  Regulations, 2013.  However, I note that the complainant Mr. Vinod Pareek has claimed that he had paid an amount of Rs. 12,000/- to the Noticees, for availing investment advisory services from the Noticees.  13. I note that the SCN also calls upon the Noticees to show cause as to why inquiry should not be held against them in terms of Rule 4 of the Rules and penalty be not imposed under Section 11 (4A) and 11 B(2) for violation of Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013 and Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. In this regard, I find that Section 15HA and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 which provides as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cPenalty for fraudulent and unfair trade practices.   15HA. If any person indulges in fraudulent and unfair trade practices relating to securities, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than five lakh rupees but which may extend to twenty-five crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such practices, whichever is higher.  Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided.  15HB. Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees.\\\\\\\\u201dFinal Order against Shri Research Services (Proprietor: Gourav Kumar Gour) Page 8 of 12  14. I note that Noticees are in violation of provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 and IA Regulations, 2013, as discussed in para 10 above, therefore, Noticees are liable for penalty under Section 15HB of SEBI Act, 1992. In view of the findings recorded in para 11 above, penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992, is not attracted in the present case.  15. I note that while imposing penalty under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 the factors enumerated in Section 15J are to be taken into consideration. Section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992 provides as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cFactors to be taken into account while adjudging quantum of penalty.  15J. While adjudging quantum of penalty under 15-I or section 11 or section 11B, the Board or the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely :\\\\\\\\u2014  (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default;  (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default;  (c) the repetitive nature of the default.   Explanation.\\\\\\\\u2014 For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E, clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.\\\\\\\\u201d  16. I find that the material available on record does not indicate the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticees as it cannot be confirmed whether the credits of Rs. 14,63,061/- in the Axis Bank Account- 916020044292311 of the Noticees for the period January 01, 2018 \\\\\\\\u2013 July 12, 2018  have been received only from investors for unregistered investment advisory services. I note that the Noticees are being directed refund the money received from the clients/investors/complainant, as fees or consideration or  in  any  other  form,  in  respect  of  their  unregistered  investment  advisory activities. Further, the material available on record does not indicate the total amount of loss caused to specific investors or group of investors, as a result of the default by the Noticees. However, IFinal Order against Shri Research Services (Proprietor: Gourav Kumar Gour) Page 9 of 12  note that the complainant, Mr. Vinod Pareek has claimed that he had paid an amount of 12,000/- to the Noticees for availing investment advisory services. With regard to whether the default by the Noticees is repetitive in nature, I note that the Noticees were acting as investment adviser without obtaining a certificate of registration as investment adviser.  17. In  view  of  the  foregoing,  I,  in  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  upon  me  under Sections, 11(1), 11(4), 11(4A), 11B(1), 11B(2) and 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Rule 5 of the Rules, hereby direct that:  (i) The Noticees shall within a period of three months from the date of coming into force of this direction, refund the money received from the clients/investors/complainant, as fees or consideration or  in  any  other  form,  in  respect  of  their  unregistered  investment  advisory activities;  (ii) The Noticees shall issue public notice in all editions of two National Dailies (one  English  and  one  Hindi)  and  in  one  local  daily  with  wide  circulation, detailing the modalities for refund, including the details of contact person such as names, addresses and contact details, within 15 days of coming into force of this direction;  (iii) The repayments to the clients/investors shall be effected only through Bank Demand Draft or Pay Order or electronic fund transfer or through any other appropriate  banking  channels,  which  ensures  audit  trails  to  identify  the beneficiaries of repayments;  (iv) The Noticees are prevented from selling their assets, properties and holding of mutual funds/shares/securities held by them in demat and physical form except for the sole purpose of making the refunds as directed above.

The SCN, inter alia, alleged that Inter Globe Finance Limited (hereinafter also referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIGFL\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cthe Company\\\\\\\\u201d) and its directors i.e. Noticee no. 2 to 6, have failed to present true and fair financial statements of IGFL and had executed transactions which are non-genuine in nature tantamounting to misrepresentation of the accounts/ financials statement and misuse of funds of the Company and such acts were found to be fraudulent in nature as they induced the investors to trade in the securities of the Company and had the potential to mislead the investors. It was also alleged that the directors of IGFL had failed to exercise duty of care, and failed to discharge their fiduciary responsibility. In view of the above, the SCN alleged that the Company (Noticee no. 1) and its directors (Noticee no. 2 to 6) have violated Sections 12A(a), (b) & (c) of the SEBI Act,1992 and Regulations 3(b), (c) & (d) and Regulations 4(1), 4(2) (f) & (r) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulation, 2003\\\\\\\\u201d), Regulations 4(2)(f)(ii)(6) & (7), 4(2)(f)(iii)(3),(6) & (12), Regulation 33(1)(d) and Regulation 30(6) of SEBI (Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulation, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cLODR Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) read with Section 21 of SCRA, 1956.   2. The brief facts of the case, the brief findings of the investigation and the allegations levelled against the Noticees, as mentioned in the SCN are as follows:   2.1. SEBI passed an interim order on March 01, 2018, inter-alia, permitting the promoters and the directors (Noticee no. 2 to 6) of IGFL to only buy the securities of IGFL and restraining them from selling any of securities held by them. Further,Final Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 3 of 62   vide the said interim order, the stock exchange (BSE) was directed to appoint an independent forensic auditor to, inter-alia, further verify:  2.1.1. Misrepresentation including of financials and/or business of IGFL, if any;  2.1.2. Misuse of the funds/books of accounts of IGFL, if any.    2.2. The forensic audit report was submitted to SEBI by the stock exchange on September 11, 2019 and the findings of the forensic audit report from the period April 01, 2015 till March 31, 2018 were examined.   2.3. The investigation, inter-alia, revealed the following:  I. Misrepresentation including of financials and misuse of funds/ books of accounts:  2.3.1. The Company has paid huge amount of funds amounting to Rs 34.64 lakhs in cash to M/s Kashiram Jain & Co. for acquisition of shares of 6 companies (Inter Globe Projects Ltd., Inter Globe Realty Ventures Ltd., Inter Globe Tradex and Services Ltd, Inter Globe Medical College & Hospital Ltd., Inter Globe Engitech India Ltd. and Inter Globe Realtors Projects India Ltd) thereby raising concerns over the genuinity of business transactions carried out by the Company and also indicating that the Company has not followed good governance practices by carrying out such huge amount of transactions in cash.  2.3.2. The disposal of shareholding by IGFL in 6 investee companies i.e. Inter Globe Projects Ltd., Inter Globe Realty Ventures Ltd., Inter Globe Tradex and Services Ltd, Inter Globe Medical College & Hospital Ltd., Inter Globe Engitech India Ltd. and Inter Globe Realtors Projects India Ltd. (hereinafter the six companies collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Investee Companies\\\\\\\\u2019), at a loss of Rs 5.47 lakhs (sale price of Rs 29.17 lakhs, cost Rs 34.64 lakhs) indicates that IGFL has not carried out proper and necessary due diligence of theFinal Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 4 of 62   fundamentals and performance of the 6 investee companies before acquisition of shares in these companies.  2.3.3. The absence of any prudent economic and business rationale, behind sale and repurchase of shares amounting to Rs 10.28 crores by IGFL to/from its subsidiary i.e. M/s Inter Globe Tradex & Services Ltd. and subsequent closing of the said subsidiary, indicates that the transaction was merely carried out by IGFL to facilitate accommodation entries/circulation of funds, thereby leading to misuse of funds of the Company.  2.3.4. The fact that 44 companies are operating from the same registered office address as that of IGFL, raises doubts over the operations of the company  2.3.5. The SCN alleges that these irregularities tantamount to misrepresentation of financials/misuse of funds/ books of accounts of the Company and has misled existing and prospective investors.  II. Violation of SEBI Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations):  2.3.6. IGFL has violated Regulation 33(1)(d) of Chapter IV of SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015 as the auditor of the company has not subjected himself to the peer review process of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and does not hold a valid certificate issued by the Peer Review Board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).  2.3.7. IGFL has violated Regulation 30(6) of SEBI LODR Regulations, by not disclosing to the stock exchange about its acquisition of shares in 6 companies (Inter Globe Projects Ltd., Inter Globe Realty Ventures Ltd., Inter Globe Tradex and Services Ltd, Inter Globe Medical College & Hospital Ltd., Inter Globe Engitech India Ltd. and Inter Globe Realtors Projects India Ltd), within twenty four hours of such acquisition as the disclosure was made byFinal Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 5 of 62   the Company to the stock exchange only on September 01, 2016 whereas the obligation for purchase was discharged by the Company on November 13, 2015 and February 06, 2016.   2.4.

It is further alleged that IGFL had misused funds/ misrepresented books of accounts which are detrimental to the interests of genuine investors and are fraudulent in nature.  2.5.

In view of the above, the SCN alleged that the Company and its directors (Noticee no. 2 to 6) have violated Sections 12A(a), (b) & (c) of the SEBI Act,1992 and Regulations 3(b), (c) & (d) and Regulations 4(1), 4(2) (f) & (r) of the PFUTP Regulation, 2003, Regulations 4(2)(f)(ii)(6) & (7), 4(2)(f)(iii)(3),(6) & (12), Regulation 33(1)(d) and Regulation 30(6) of LODR Regulations read with Section 21 of SCRA, 1956.   3. I note that Noticee no. 3 and 6 have filed a combined reply dated December 25, 2020 to the SCN. I also note that Noticee no. 1, 2, 4 and 5 have filed a combined merit based reply dated December 24, 2020. The Noticees were granted an opportunity of personal hearing on December 28, 2020, on which date the Advocates appearing on behalf of the Noticees were heard. Subsequent to the personal hearing, Noticee no. 1, 2, 4 and 5 have filed written submission dated January 12, 2021.Final Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 6 of 62   4. Noticee no. 1, 2, 4 and 5, vide their combined merit based reply dated December 24, 2020 and written submissions dated January 12, 2021, have raised the following key contentions to the allegations levelled by the SCN:  Allegation (I)(i): IGFL\\\\\\\\u2019s acquisition of the shares of the Investee Companies by means of a cash transaction with M/s Kashiram Jain & Co., amounting to Rs. 34.64 lakhs raises concern over genuineness and is not good governance practice.   4.1. It is our submission that this allegation is generic and unsubstantiated. There is a logical and genuine trail of entries that follows this transaction. The investments via bank withdrawal have been properly recorded in our books under non-current investments in the annual accounts of FY 2015-2016. IGFL is not a fly by night company\\\\\\\\u2014it is also a public listed company fully functioning.  4.2. In addition, it has also been properly recorded in the books of M/s Kashiram Jain & Co in its annual audited accounts for the financial year 2015-16 filed by them with BSE. M/s Kashiram Jain & Co has also issued a proper receipt for the cash received by IGFL. It is pertinent to note that M/s Kashiram Jain & Co is not a fly-by-night company in any manner. It is also a BSE public listed company. Details of the recording of this transaction in M/s Kashiram Jain & Co\\\\\\\\u2019s books of accounts can be found at paragraph 17 of the Reply.   4.3. The amount of Rs. 34.64 lakhs might seem large but it was the total amount invested into the 6 different investee companies. Therefore, investment into each investee company was not a large sum whatsoever. The details of the amounts invested into each of these Investee Companies are reiterated as follows and can also be found at paragraph 15 of the Reply. Table No. 4 Sl.

The amount paid by IGFL, i.e. Rs 34.64 Lakhs, was properly recorded in books of accounts and reflected as \\\\\\\\u2018Non\\\\\\\\u2013Current investments\\\\\\\\u2019 in the annual accounts of FY 2015-16. The recording of the transaction is as per normal accounting procedure prescribed in \\\\\\\\u2018AS-13. Accounting for Investments\\\\\\\\u2019 issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.   4.5. The Forensic Audit Report relies on Clause 2.2 of the Share Purchase Agreement  dated November 6, 2015 entered with the seller to suggest that as per the said Share Purchase Agreement, the payment was to be made to the seller through bank transfer and since IGFL made payment by cash, the transaction is \\\\\\\\u2018suspicious\\\\\\\\u2019. Such a reasoning is incorrect and arbitrary. More-so since, the seller M/s Kashiram Jain & Co, a listed company on BSE, had issued proper Receipts evidencing payment of the requisite amount by IGFL. In fact, these payments are duly reflected in the annual audited accounts of M/s Kashiram Jain & Co for the financial year 2015-16 filed by them with BSE. Form AOC \\\\\\\\u2013 1 filed by the sellerFinal Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 8 of 62   for FY 2015-16, statement of accounts of the seller (duly stamped) the receipts of the amount paid by IGFL along-with Cash Flow statement for the year 2015-16 and Schedule of Investments. Correspondingly, the annual accounts of IGFL has also duly reflects these payments acquisition of the shares. The purchase of shares of Investee Companies is also duly reflected in the Shareholders Register and Share Transfer Register of those companies.  4.6. Merely because such a transaction was done by means of cash cannot be grounds to doubt its genuineness. Its genuineness is further supported by the fact that it was properly recorded and disclosed in the books of both IGFL and M/s Kashiram Jain & Co and that it corresponds perfectly with another.    4.7. It is pertinent to note that decisions were taken in the commercial wisdom and were informed decisions. These were taken keeping the best interests of IGFL and its shareholders in mind. It is a well settled principle of law that courts will not interfere in commercial decisions or substitute their own notions of what is sound business judgment in decisions. Courts cannot go into merits of commercial decisions since they are not considered to have expertise in the commercial decision-making for a particular enterprise. This principle is also well-established in the United States of America and the United Kingdom where it is referred to as the business judgment rule and is used in cases of ascertaining liability of corporations and directors. It has now evolved to be a general common law doctrine.  4.8. The Noticees submit that the payment for acquisition of shares from M/s Kashiram Jain & Co was in the FY 2015-16. During the relevant time there was no restriction in undertaking cash transactions in terms of the Income Tax Act, 1961. It was only in the subsequent financial year (i.e. from FY 2017-2018) certain limits were prescribed by the government of India on certain cash transactions. In other words, prior to April 1, 2017, there was no restriction on cash payments/receipts. Hence, we submit that the purchase of shares of Investee Companies wasFinal Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 9 of 62   undertaken in due compliance of the IT Act as well as the applicable securities laws.  4.9. Further, as per RBI master circular dated July 1, 2014 (no. RBI/2014-15/92), all banks are required to maintain & report cash transactions beyond a limit of Rs. ten (10) lakhs to the RBI in the form of Cash Transaction Report and all suspicious transactions are to be reported in the Suspicious Transaction Report if they felt that such transaction was suspicious or there was something amiss. Although Karnataka Bank has included the withdrawal of cash made by IGFL for payment of consideration to M/s Kashiram Jain & Co in the Cash Transaction Report, the same was not treated as \\\\\\\\u2018suspicious\\\\\\\\u2019 transaction, and rightly so, by the relevant team of the bank.  Allegation I(ii): the disposal of shareholding in the 6 Investee Companies at a loss of 5.47 lakhs indicates that IGFL did not carry out due diligence before acquisition   4.10. It is further alleged in the SCN that disposal of six Investee Companies at a loss of Rs. 5.47 lakhs (sale price of Rs. 29.17 lakhs against cost price of Rs. 34.64 lakhs) indicates that IGFL has not carried out due diligence while acquisition of shares. Such an allegation is contrary to the facts on record and wholly unsubstantiated. More-so, because: (i) adequate due diligence was undertaken by the Board at all stages of acquisition; and (ii) there was no loss on sale of Investee Company and Rs. 5.47 lakhs was the business expense for operations of the Investee Companies.  4.11. At the relevant time, the net-worth of IGFL was around Rs. 92.8 cores. The investment in Investee Companies was for Rs. 34.64 lakhs, which constitutes merely 0.36% of overall net-worth of IGFL. Thus, of all the investment decisions taken by IGFL, the impact of this particular acquisition of the Investee Companies was relatively less. Regardless, IGFL took the decision only after carrying out proper and adequate due diligence of the Investee Companies which alsoFinal Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 10 of 62   included several telephonic and physical meetings with the M/s Kashiram Jain & Co and after having satisfied itself of the commercial benefits of the acquisition.  4.12. The Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s had appointed a company law consulting firm viz, M/s Ranay Goswami & Co. which conducted a thorough due diligence of the Investee Companies.   4.13. The Forensic Audit Report observes that the due diligence report (of Ranay Goswami & Co.) contains information from the public domain only, which is plainly incorrect. To illustrate, the said reports contain details of income tax returns of the Investee Companies, which are not available anywhere in the public domain. The Noticees had given a specific mandate to M/s Ranay Goswami & Co. to enquire into all the liabilities of the Investee Companies so as to not be surprised by any hidden liabilities after the acquisition of the Investee Companies. The information provided by the seller to Ranay Goswami & Co. was verified and checked with the information available in the public domain to the extent that it was available before the proposed acquisition  4.14. In accordance with Section 179 of the Companies Act, the IGFL board (on November 6, 2015) decided that it is prudent to diversify operations as well as risks and hence funds be invested in the Investee Companies. The purpose of the investment was to diversify IGFL\\\\\\\\u2019s operations as well as risks since the lending operations in FY 2014-15 were not very conducive. The Board of Directors of IGFL in its Management Discussion & Analysis Report  contained in the Annual Report for FY 2014-15 had already conveyed to its shareholders about its cautious approach towards lending in order to avoid non-performing assets. Therefore, in the meeting of the Board of Directors held on November 6, 2015, the Board decided to invest in the Investee Companies as it was confident that the 6 companies (even though small in size/ operation) would help IGFL in achieving its long-term objective of diversification/ growth. The investment was also undertakenFinal Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 11 of 62   on the basis of various deliberations by the management, which is also a recorded and documented fact.   4.15. At the time of acquisition of the Investee Companies, IGFL wanted to explore investment opportunities in real sectors of the economy. However, subsequently, the Managing Director S.K. Jain\\\\\\\\u2019s health took a turn for the worse. In addition, it is also pertinent to note at this point that it was Mr. S.K. Jain who had been instrumental in leading plans for exploring investment opportunities in these sectors.   4.16. Due to on-going health issues of the Managing Director Mr. S.K. Jain, the Audit Committee of IGFL suggested that it was not the right time to diversify and instead suggested that IGFL focus on its core operations. On 7th August 2017, the Board of the Investee Companies met and decided to wind up and strike-off the Investee Companies. An extra-ordinary general meeting was held on 30th August 2017 to obtain shareholder approval for the winding up of Investee Companies. All necessary formalities were initiated with the Registrar of Companies for striking-off the Investee Companies and the STK-2 Challan was issued on 12th September 2017. Eventually Mr. Jain passed away due to ill-health in February - 2018  4.17. Generally, on the winding up of a company, all the assets in the books of a subsidiary company\\\\\\\\u2014in whatever form they might be in\\\\\\\\u2014are transferred to the subsidiary owner. IGFL\\\\\\\\u2019s and its subsidiaries case was no different. Accordingly, assets amounting to Rs. 29.18 lakhs of all Investee Companies were transferred to IGFL\\\\\\\\u2019s books. The difference between the amount invested, i.e. Rs. 34.64 lakhs, and amount recovered, i.e. Rs. 29.18 lakhs, is Rs. 5.47 lakhs. This Rs. 5.47 lakhs was the amount spent during FY 2015-16 to FY 2017-18 on the Investee Companies primarily on account of ROC & other statutory filing expenses apart from normal business expenses. Certain amount was also paid to GovernmentFinal Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 12 of 62   agencies & towards other sundry petty expenses. This was the \\\\\\\\u201closs\\\\\\\\u201d alleged by the SCN. However, in view of above, it can be seen that it was merely the regular business expenses and not in any way contentious.   4.18. In fact, the independent forensic auditors appointed by the Independent Directors of IGFL by the name of M/S JLN US & Co., which are also SEBI & NSE empanelled auditors, thoroughly scrutinised the records to arrive at the amount of Rs. 5.47 lakhs.  4.19. Further, the Forensic Audit Report (@page 17 under para 9) makes a passing mention that due diligence was not conducted by IGFL since the Investee Companies were sold within period of four (4) months. Such a stand is incorrect since the Investee Companies were sold after a period of twenty (20) months and not four (4) months. Based on this misunderstanding the Forensic Auditor\\\\\\\\u2019s arrived at incorrect conclusion of Board of Directors being non-diligent.  4.20. In view of the above, it is submitted that the allegation that there was not adequate due diligence\\\\\\\\u2014particularly in light of the external M/s Ranay Goswami\\\\\\\\u2019s opinion\\\\\\\\u2014following the investment and its disposal is baseless and erroneous.  4.21. The Forensic Audit Report alleges that IGFL was not \\\\\\\\u2018diligent\\\\\\\\u2019 in investing in the Investee Companies. It is submitted that, as part of its business operations, the Board makes various investments decisions. Some of these result in profit and some result loss. Merely incurring a loss, especially a loss due to regular business expenses, which in the context of IGFL is relatively nominal, cannot be the basis to level an allegation that the Board is not diligent. The law on what is considered as \\\\\\\\u2018due diligence\\\\\\\\u2019 has been clarified by the Supreme Court of India in the case of Chander Kant Bansal [(2008) 5 SCC 117]. 27. In addition, it is submitted that the decision to invest or dispose of the shareholding were decisions taken exercising commercial wisdom and business judgment of IGFL and its Board of Directors. ItFinal Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 13 of 62   is, therefore, submitted that courts should not go into the merits of these decisions or substitute their own judgment in these decisions.  Allegation I(iii): there is no economic and business rationale behind the sale and repurchase of shares amounting to Rs. 10.28 Crores by IGFL to/from its subsidiary  4.22. It is submitted that this allegation has no basis and has not been substantiated either in the Forensic Audit Report or in the SCN. The brief chronology of events that led to the sale and repurchases of shares of IGOL and IGRL, to M/s Inter Globe Tradex & Services Ltd (subsidiary) is as follows.  4.23. On 4th April 2015, the Board of Directors of IGFL decided to reduce volatility in share business by reducing the shareholding portfolio and focusing on trading portfolio in a board meeting. In order to focus on the core business area, the Board thought it prudent to \\\\\\\\u201creduce business volatility by reducing share transactions\\\\\\\\u201d in a meeting held on 5th April 2016.  4.24. Consequently, on 12th November 2016, the IGFL Audit Committee reviewed and approved the sale of investments in IGOL and IGRL to M/s Inter Globe Tradex & Services Ltd.   4.25. On 28th November 2016, the Board of IGFL decided to transfer its investments in IGOL and IGRL to M/s Inter Globe Tradex & Services Ltd. Shareholders of IGFL were informed by way of a BSE announcement dated 28th November 2016. On November 30th, the shares of IGOL and IGRL were sold to M/s Inter Globe Tradex & Services Ltd for Rs. 10.25 crore and properly reflected in the books of account.  The break-up is as follows:  IGRL= 62,650 shares * Rs. 125/share = Rs. 78,31,250 IGOL= 4,80,600 * Rs. 197/share = Rs. 9,46,78,200Final Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 14 of 62   4.26. IGFL also submitted a Chartered Accountant\\\\\\\\u2019s certificate which stated that the necessary procedure and process as required for the sale of shares to M/s Inter Globe Tradex & Services Ltd. had been carried out in good faith.   4.27. The reasons IGFL had decided to focus on core business operations rather than diversify have already been set out above. The business rationale, therefore, is abundantly clear behind this decision. The decision to transfer shares of IGOL and IGRL to their own subsidiary rather than outside of their Investee Companies was taken with the intention of not impacting the overall revenue of IGFL and its shareholders. The decision was taken by the Board in its prudence without any economic detriment to the shareholders of IGFL and, in fact, only for the benefit of IGFL and its shareholders The rationale was also shared with shareholders in the annual report of 2016-17 which states as follows:  \\\\\\\\u201cThe Business strategy of reducing Equity investments and focusing on core loan activity helped company deliver robust numbers. The summary of our financial performance is as follows:  Our Interest Income stood at Rs. 666 lakhs. Profit after tax increased to Rs. 156.60 lakhs in 2016-17 against Rs. 27.37 lakhs in 2015-16. Earnings per share (EPD) stood at Rs. 2.30 in the current year against Rs. 0.40 in 2015-16.\\\\\\\\u201d  4.28. The rise in profits of the Company by nearly 5 times itself shows successful implementation of the overall business strategy & hence satisfying the economic and business rationale as well.  4.29. In addition, even the Forensic Audit Report in respect to this allegation opines that \\\\\\\\u201cthe transaction of sale and re-purchase seems to fulfil all the legal requirements\\\\\\\\u201d. Despite this, the SCN alleges that the transaction seems to be more in the natureFinal Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 15 of 62   of circulation of funds/accommodation entries. However, no such alleged particular accommodative entries or evidence of alleged circulation of funds have been pointed out in the entire SCN as well as the Forensic Audit Report.  4.30. Subsequent to the Forensic Audit report, these transactions were scrutinised by Income tax department & an assessment order was passed by two different assessing officer where they have considered the purchase and sale transaction between IGFL & M/s Inter Globe Tradex & Services Ltd as genuine. It is respectfully submitted that income tax department is the primary department that review and scrutinizes such transaction did not find anything amiss or illegal in the transaction. In hindsight, for the Forensic Audittor to consider the same as non-genuine and that too without any evidentiary proof is arbitrary and illegal.   Allegation I(iv): there are allegedly 44 companies are operating from the same registered address as IGFL which raises doubts over operation of IGFL .  4.31. It is submitted that this allegation that 44 companies are operating from the same registered office as IGFL has no substantiated basis in whatsoever. The allegation has been made in the SCN and Forensic Audit Report by relying on a non-official and random website called \\\\\\\\u2018Zauba\\\\\\\\u2019. No official records have been relied on and instead of relying on the records of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), a fly-by-night website is being relied on. Such records are not in any way official records. This allegation is, therefore, absolutely factually incorrect and does not require any warrant any further argument whatsoever.  4.32. Additionally, the forensic auditors after their audit unequivocally opined that \\\\\\\\u201cOn the basis of site visit the Company seem to be operating in the normal course of business and no adverse observation could be found\\\\\\\\u201d As a matter of fact, Forensic Audit Report has not made any such allegation. On the said particular allegation, the SCN travels beyond the Forensic Audit Report and makes a random and unsubstantiated allegation.Final Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 16 of 62    4.33. Without prejudice to same, based on the nonpartisan review and scrutiny of ROC records, an independent company secretary in its report opined that:  4.33.1. Out of forty-four (44) companies listed in the Forensic Audit Report, seventeen (17) companies are non-active due to amalgamation/strike-off/ liquidation, etc. They do not exist at the impugned address.  4.33.2. Out of the remaining twenty-seven (27) companies, there are six companies (6) which are not situated in Aloka House and have a completely different address as per the MCA records.  4.33.3. Out of the remaining twenty-one (21) companies, eighteen companies are not related to IGFL/ its promoters/ directors. These companies are situated in separate blocks on the first floor of Aloka House and not in Room No. B-19 (wherein IGFL is situated).  4.33.4. The address remaining three (3) companies related to IGFL or its promoters entity are as under:  Table: Address of Companies Sl. No. Name of Company Block No. (on first floor of IGFL) 1. Inter Globe Finance Ltd B \\\\\\\\u2013 19 2. Inter Globe Realty LLP B - 13 3. Inter Globe Overseas Ltd B - 22  4.34. IGFL does not conduct its business from the entire first floor of the building (Aloka House) wherein its registered office is located. There are almost thirty-two (32) office spaces /blocks/ rooms on the first floor itself (numbered from B-1 to B-32). Hence, to sweepingly assume that the office of other entities and IGFL is same is incorrect.Final Order in the matter of Inter Globe Finance Limited    Page 17 of 62    Allegation II(i): the auditor of IGFL has not subjected itself to the peer review process of ICAI and does not hold a valid certificate issued by the Peer Review Board of ICAI  4.35. It is submitted that the current auditors, M/s Bijan Ghosh & Associates, as well as the past auditors, M/s Manish Mahavir & Co, of IGFL subsequently subjected themselves to the peer board review process and obtained valid certificates issued by the peer board review of the ICAI.   Allegation II(ii): IGFL has not disclosed to stock exchange about its acquisition of shares in the Investee Companies within twenty-four (24) hours of acquisition.  4.36. It is submitted, in regard to this allegation, that the agreement to purchase shares of the Investee Companies was executed on 6th November, 2015 when the LODR Regulations had not even come into force. The LODR Regulations were notified on 1st September 2015 and only came into force much later from its 90th day of its publication, i.e. from 1st December 2015.
