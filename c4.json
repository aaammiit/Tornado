It is alleged from the trading pattern of the above group (13 entities) that they were not acting as genuine buyers and had no bona fide intention to buy because in-spite of sufficient sell orders with abundant quantity being available in the market, they placed buy orders for only 1 or 2 shares repeatedly in each transaction, in 983 instances, which were above the last traded price. Further, In 49 instances the counterparties were also found to be connected. By these repeated trades, the entities, as a group, were instrumental in establishing a price higher than the last traded price and thus contributed to increase in scrip price with each of their trades.  Hence, it is alleged that the Noticees manipulated the scrip price and created a misleading Adjudication order in the matter of Aadhaar Ventures India Ltd Page 9 of 71 appearance of trading in the scrip of AVIL by such trades in violation of Regulations 3(a)(b)(c)(d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) and 4(2)(e) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003.  4. The details of delivery of SCNs and further communication with Noticees are as follows: 4.1. Chandrakant B Shah (Noticee 1) The common SCN was sent via Speed Post with Acknowledgement Due (SPAD). However, it returned undelivered. Therefore, SCN was served on the Noticee vide affixture on February 22, 2018. Vide letter dated August 25, 2020, Noticee were granted final opportunity to submit reply to the SCN by September 07, 2020 and was granted opportunity of personal hearing on September 14, 2020. Further, vide email dated September 08, 2020, Noticee requested additional time for submitting reply to the SCN. Vide email dated September 11, 2020, Noticee was granted time till September 08, 2020 to submit reply to the SCN. Vide email dated September 14, 2020, Noticee intimated appointment of RV legal, Advocates as Authorized Representatives in the matter. Vide letter dated September 14, 2020, Noticee submitted reply to the SCN. The reply is summarized below: 1. The Noticee writes with reference to the notice dated 08.02.2018 (SCN) directing him to Show Cause in connection with the dealings in the scrip of Aadhar Ventures India Limited (herein after referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAVIL\\\\\\\\u201d) during the investigation period 01.01.2009 to 24.04.2015 to ascertain possible violations in respect of twenty noticees mentioned in the said SCN. The Noticee is named as Noticee No. 1. 2. At the outset, the common Show Cause Notice issued by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Adjudicating Officer suffers from great delay and latches. The delay is not even explained which is against the principle of natural justice and has caused great prejudice to the Noticee as due to his old age, has stopped dealing in securities market since 2012 and if any penalty is levied at this junction it will be a burden on the Noticee. The impugned transactions pertain to the period September 2009, June to August 2010 and November 2010. Whereas the SCN is issued on 08.02.2018 and hence there is a delay of more than 7 years in issuance of SCN which delay is not even explained. In the matter of HB Stockholdings Limited versus Securities and Exchange Board of India (Appeal No. 114 of 2012), Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT while observing that \\\\\\\\u2018the alleged trades took place in the year 2000. The first show cause notice itself was issued by the Respondent on September 2, 2005 i.e. after a period of more Adjudication order in the matter of Aadhaar Ventures India Ltd Page 10 of 71 than five years had already lapsed. There is not even a whisper in the impugned order to explain away such a long delay in issuing the SCN\\\\\\\\u2019 observed that, \\\\\\\\u201cAt this point we find it pertinent to note that human memory has a short shelf life. Allowing matters to go on and on for years together by the Respondent serves no purpose, rather it risks loss of evidence such as important documents which may get destroyed while the issue gathers dust. Such systemic failures occur to the disadvantage of all parties concerned and lead to consequences such as genuine violators being allowed to function normally in the capital market for years together, whereas in some situations the reputation of innocent entities gets tarnished as they wait for the wheels of justice to turn a bit faster than the pace at which they seem to be going.\\\\\\\\u201d On this line Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Tribunal concluded that \\\\\\\\u201cThus, the existence of unnatural and unexplained delay of more than a decade and prejudice caused due to such undue delay is writ large in the matter. Therefore, the impugned order deserves to be quashed on this ground as well.  3. Further, the Noticee states that the investigation period is from 01.01.2009 to 24.04.2015 which is divided into 3 Patches however, only trades during Patch I i.e. 01.01.2009 to 01.08.2011 are considered objectionable. This is very unusual and abnormal. It appears that for considering such a long period there seems to be some collateral purpose. The charges in the SCN pertain to PFUTP Regulations and it is highly unlikely that an undesirable activity can last long for such a period. Hence, SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s throwing a wide net far and long itself raises suspicion about its motive and that too after a period of 5 years from the settled dates of trades. The entire cause of action is unreasonable and disproportionate. 4. At the further outset, the Noticee states that multiple enforcement actions in sequence \\\\\\\\u2014 one after the other SCN under section 1 1(1), 11(4), & 11 B of SEBI Act, 1992 and then Notice under Rule 4 of SEBI (procedure for holding inquiry and imposing penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules 1995, are initiated against the Noticee in this scrip which has caused great prejudice to the Noticee. The Noticee states that an order dated 30.07.2020 has already been passed by the WTM under Section 11(1), 11 (4), & 11 B of SEBI Act, 1992 by which the Noticee has been debarred from the securities market for a period of 6 months. Hereto annexed and marked as Annexure \\\\\\\\u201cA\\\\\\\\u201d is a copy of the said WTM\\\\\\\\u2019s order dated 30.07.2020. The Noticee is already undergone debarment and thus the penalty, if any, levied on the Noticee in this adjudication proceedings shall cause prejudice to the Noticee after almost a decade of the impugned transactions. The Noticee relies upon the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT\\\\\\\\u2019s order dated 02.08.2019 in the matter of P G Electroplast Ltd. v SEBI. \\\\\\\\u201c16. Since the appellant had already undergone a considerable period of debarment pursuant to the order of SEBI, the Tribunal reduced the debarment from ten years to seven years for the partial disclosure of information in the prospectus. In the ultimate analysis, the order of debarment was for violation of partial disclosure in the prospectus and not for violation of PFUTP Regulations. The AO while imposing the penalty 3 has not factored this debarment while fixing the quantum of penalty. Further, in our opinion, the Adjudication order in the matter of Aadhaar Ventures India Ltd Page 11 of 71 factors contemplated under Section 15J was also not considered by the AO in the right perspective.\\\\\\\\u201d Hereto annexed and marked as Annexure \\\\\\\\u201cB\\\\\\\\u201d is a copy of the said order dated 02.08.2019. 5. The Noticee states that he is 83 years old and is not actively trading in the securities market since 2012. Thus, any penalty levied at this juncture i.e. after a period of 10 years from the settled impugned transactions will be a burden on the Noticee. 6. The Noticee states that the following are the details of trades of 8 days on which days certain trades of the Noticee are considered objectionable towards positive LTP : Date Total buy quantity Qty of shares alleged towards +LTP LTP (Rs) Market volume 24.09.2009 65151 2 0.37 80125 21.06.2010 37581 1 0.10 673788 25.06.2010 249002 1 0.15 582262 30.06.2010 6111 1 0.25 602026 01.07.2010 10281 1 0.20 802578 08.07.2010 340 1 0.30 854087 06.08.2010 4452 1 0.25 1007204 11.11.2010 228905 1 0.50 626027   9 2.12   7. The Noticee states that SEBI has alleged (in para 11 of the SCN) that the group of 13 Noticees were instrumental in manipulating the price of the scrip by continuously placing orders for miniscule quantities even when the counter orders were already existing at higher / lower prices and for larger quantities in 983 instances which were above the Last Traded Price thus created a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip. The Noticee denies the charges as alleged by SEBI based on the reasons explained hereunder.  ALLEGATIONS AND COMMENTS : 8. In para 4 of the SCN, \\\\\\\\u201cit was noted that a group of 79 entities had either traded or connected with those who had traded in the scrip of AVIL. Based on the trading pattern and connections, the said group of 79 entities were considered suspected group entities. The details of connections between suspected group entities is placed in Annexure \\\\\\\\u2014 1\\\\\\\\u201d, S No PAN Entity Basis of connection Remarks Adjudication order in the matter of Aadhaar Ventures India Ltd Page 12 of 71 29 AAFCA3926K Aansal Securities Services Pvt Ltd S No 78 is a director at S No 29 and 30 The Noticee was a director in this company till 01.04.2011. No other role, involvement or participation of Aansal Securities Services Pvt Ltd. trades with the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s trades is shown or established. Further, the entity is not even a noticee to the SCN and hence the connection of the Noticee is of no relevance and of not Significance. It has not been alleged to have contributed to positive LTP. 30 AAFCM1942F Moss Traders Pvt Ltd S No 78 is a director at S No 29 and 30 The Noticee was a director in this company only till 01.04.2011. No other role, involvement or participation of Moss Traders Pvt Ltd trades with the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s trades is shown or established 78 AJKPS6764L Chandrakant Bhogilal Shah S No 78 is a director at S No 29 and 30 The Noticee was a director in these companies till 01.04.2011. No other role, involvement or participation with respect to the trades of these 2 companies is shown or established. 79  Santosh Vasant Bhelekar Off market transfer with S No 78 The quantity of shares and the day on which the said off-market transaction is executed is not even mentioned in the SCN and the Noticee requests SEBI to provide with the details of these off-market transfers. As per the Noticee, there were no off-market transaction that took place with Santosh Bhelekar Adjudication order in the matter of Aadhaar Ventures India Ltd Page 13 of 71 The Noticee states that for the purpose of establishing connection, 79 entities are sought to be connected. The Noticee states that for the purpose of positive LTP allegation, the investigation was boiled down to 52 entities. Further, the investigation was boiled down to 18 entities for the purpose of positive LTP allegation by entering into trades of 1 or 2 shares. The Noticee states that SEBI has been fumbling and faltering in deciding the parameters for the purpose of charge. Thus, it appears that discretion is not used judiciously and judicially. The Noticee denies that the Noticee was a part of the group as alleged or otherwise. The Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s trading was separate, independent and stand alone and cannot be linked / connected or related to the group\\\\\\\\u2019s volume. The SCN has not established any cogent connection between the Noticee and each and every party of the alleged group on contemporaneous basis at the relevant time and are not related to each of  their trades and no role played in each of the trades. Further, with respect to the two companies where the Noticee is shown as a director, the Noticee states that they are not the counter party to any of his trades which are considered objectionable towards positive LTP contribution and the company Aansal Securities Services Pvt Ltd is not even a party in the SCN. The Noticee submits that the findings against him in SCN are not borne out by facts and he has been roped in just because of a few trades of 1 or 2 shares. The Noticee had been buying and / or was selling shares of even higher quantities and thus the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s trades were in the ordinary course of trading / investment business. The findings are therefore de hors consideration of Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s investment pattern. There is no concrete material to suggest that the Noticee acted in collusion or in concert with anyone. The Noticee with respect do not accept the adverse inferences / conclusions against him as they do not have any substantive basis in law and are contrary to facts.  9. In para 6 of the SCN, \\\\\\\\u201cit was observed that 52 entities had contributed to net positive LTP as a buyer. The LTP contribution of these 52 entities as a buyer are as under: S.

After considering the submissions made by the Noticees no. 2 to 5 and the Noticee no. 7, the then Whole Time Member, vide his order dated June 07, 2016, directed SEBI to also investigate the allegations pertaining to the SAST Regulations, 2011 levelled against the Noticees no. 2 to 5 and the Noticee no. 7 apart from other allegations covered in the interim as well as the confirmatory order. 3. On the basis of the above mentioned orders, SEBI conducted detailed investigation into the matter of dealings in the scrip of ZSL to examine whether there was any violation of provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992, the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Markets) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u2018PFUTP Regulations, 2003\\\\\\\\u2019), the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u2018PIT Regulations, 1992\\\\\\\\u2019) read with regulation 12 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 and provisions of Equity Listing Agreement (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Listing Agreement\\\\\\\\u2019) during the period of January 01, 2012 to December 31, 2012 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Investigation Period\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018IP\\\\\\\\u2019). 4. ZSL is a Chennai based information technology enabler and solutions provider for enterprises worldwide. I note from the records before me that, by way of an Order dated July 03, 2014, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Madras High Court appointed the Official Liquidator, Madras High Court as the Provisional Liquidator of the Company. Further, Justice (Retd.) S Rajeswaran, Madras High Court was also appointed as administrator of ZSL. The scrip of ZSL was listed on Bombay Stock Exchange (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBSE\\\\\\\\u201d) and National Stock Exchange (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNSE\\\\\\\\u201d) during the IP. Subsequently, the scrip of ZSL has been delisted from NSE w.e.f. February 24, 2021 and from BSE w.e.f. March 03, 2021. BSE and NSE are collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018stock exchanges\\\\\\\\u2019 in the present Order. The scrip of the Company had a fall in its price from INR 300.50 on October 08, 2012 to INROrder in the matter of Zylog Systems Ltd.   Page 4 of 167 76.40 on November 22, 2012 on NSE amounting to a fall of 74.58% in 32 trading sessions. A similar fall in price was also observed on BSE during this period. The investigations, inter alia, revealed that: (1) Stihithi, Sudarshan and Ramanujam were the promoters of ZSL during the IP. Further, Sudarshan was holding the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Ramanujam was holding the position of Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer of ZSL during the IP. Sudarshan and Ramanujam each were holding 50% shares of Sthithi and both of them were its only directors during the IP. (2) Srikanth was shown as an Independent Director in the Red Herring Prospectus of ZSL dated July 07, 2007 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018RHP\\\\\\\\u2019), filed with SEBI and Registrar of Companies (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018ROC\\\\\\\\u2019) at the time of Initial Public Offering (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018IPO\\\\\\\\u2019) of the Company. Later on, Srikanth was appointed as the Whole Time Director of ZSL on May 21, 2010. Further, Srihari, who was designated as the then Global Chief Financial Officer of ZSL, was related to Srikanth as brother-in-law, as his sister Sripriya is the spouse of Srikanth. As per the RHP, Sripriya was the 4th largest shareholder of ZSL as on the date of the IPO. (3) Companies, including Aditicon Services India Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Aditicon\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018Noticee no. 8\\\\\\\\u2019) and Effica Systems Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Effica\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018Noticee no. 9\\\\\\\\u2019) were floated in the name of employees of ZSL. Mohan R (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Mohan\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2019Noticee no. 10\\\\\\\\u2019) and Santanakumar R (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Santanakumar\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018Noticee no. 11\\\\\\\\u2019), both employees of ZSL, were made directors of Aditicon. Similarly, Santanakumar, and Krishnaveni Ganesan (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Krishnaveni\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018Noticee no. 12\\\\\\\\u2019) were appointed as directors of Effica.  (4) Krishnaveni is the wife of M V Ganesan (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Ganesan\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018Noticee no. 13\\\\\\\\u2019), the Vice President (Accounts) of the Company during the IP. Further, Noticee no. 10 was working asOrder in the matter of Zylog Systems Ltd.   Page 5 of 167 administrative officer in ZSL drawing a salary of approximately INR 20,000/- per month and Noticee no. 11 was working as accounts executive of ZSL with a salary of approximately INR 10,300/- per month.  (5) Noticee no. 13, acting as Vice President (Accounts), was directly reporting to Ramanujam. Noticees no. 10 to 12 informed during the investigation that they were made directors at the instances of Sudarshan, his brother V Viswanathan (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Viswanathan\\\\\\\\u2019) and Ramanujam and were insisted by the said three persons to sign on various documents. Thus, both Aditicon and Effica appear to be de facto controlled by the then Key Managerial Personnel (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cKMP\\\\\\\\u201d) of ZSL. (6) The connections that were noticed amongst various Noticees are presented below in a tabular as well as pictorial format: Table 1: Inter-se connections of the Noticees Noticee No. Name of Entity Connection 1 Zylog Systems Limited  Company 2 Sthithi Insurance Services Pvt Ltd  Promoter of the Company, had Sudarshan and Ramanujam as the shareholders (holding 50% shares each) and directors. V. Viswanathan (Viswanathan), brother of Sudarshan, was the authorized person for Sthithi. He was also the then General Manager (Administration) of ZSL. 3 Ms. Sudarshan Venkataraman  Promoter of the Company;  then chairman and CEO of the Company  4 Mr. Ramanujam Sesharathnam  Promoter of the Company; then MD and COO of the Company  5 Mr. P Srikanth  Whole Time Director of ZSL and spouse of Sripriya (Noticee no. 7) who was holding shares of ZSL since 2002Order in the matter of Zylog Systems Ltd.   Page 6 of 167 and fourth largest shareholder as per RHP of ZSL dated 07/07/07. 6 Mr. S.P.Srihari  Brother-in-law of Srikanth (Sripriya\\\\\\\\u2019s brother) and was the then Global Chief Financial Officer of ZSL. 7 Mrs Sripriya Srikanth Wife of Srikanth (Noticee no. 5) who was the Whole Time Director of ZSL; Sister of Srihari 8 Aditicon Services India Private Ltd. Formed in the name of employees of ZSL; The directors of Aditicon during the Investigation Period were Mohan (Noticee no. 10) and Santhanakumar R (Noticee no. 11) who are both employees of ZSL. Aditicon was controlled by then KPMs of ZSL. The same was corroborated by the statements of the then employees namely, Noticees no. 10 and 11 and M V Ganesan, Saravanan S P and Srinivasan B 9 Effica Systems Private Limited  Formed in the name of employees of ZSL; The Directors of Effica during the Investigation Period were Santhanakumar R (then employee of ZSL) and Krishnaveni Ganesan (Noticee no. 12) (wife of M V Ganesan, then VP Accounts of ZSL). Effica was controlled by then KMPs of ZSL. 10 Mr. Mohan R  An employee of ZSL; Director of Aditicon 11 Mr. Santhanakumar R  An employee of ZSL;  Director of Aditicon and Effica 12 Mrs. Krishnaveni Ganesan Wife of M V Ganesan, then VP Accounts of ZSL; Director of Effica 13  M V Ganesan Vice President \\\\\\\\u2013 Corporate Accounts of ZSL and reporting to Ramanujam.Order in the matter of Zylog Systems Ltd.   Page 7 of 167  (7) It, therefore, appears that Sudarshan, Ramanujam, Srikanth and Srihari had known to each other much before the IPO of ZSL was launched. This is because Sripriya, who was the 4th largest shareholder of ZSL as per the RHP of ZSL had received and transferred shares of ZSL from/to promoter group entity(ies) even before the IPO of ZSL was launched. Such relationships of Noticees no. 3 to 7 among themselves were relevant and were required to be disclosed in the RHP of ZSL. However, ZSL did not disclose the relationship of Noticees no. 3 to 7. Further, despite being related to Sripriya and Srihari, Srikanth was appointed as an Independent Director of ZSL at the time of the IPO. (8) Further, Noticees no. 3 to 6 had incorporated companies viz. Aditicon and Effica by making certain employees of ZSL and their relatives viz. Noticees no. 10 to 12 as Directors in these companies. The names of these companies were used to open demat and bank accounts, which were thereupon used to acquire shares of ZSL and route funds to Noticees no. 3Order in the matter of Zylog Systems Ltd.   Page 8 of 167 to 6 and entities connected with them.  (9) As per the interim order, Sripriya had received funds from ZSL, its subsidiaries, its promoters as well as Aditicon and Effica on numerous occasions which were immediately transferred to various brokers, to be used for margin trading facility availed by her, as well as transferred to certain Non-Banking Financial Companies (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018NBFCs\\\\\\\\u2019), as repayments of loans taken by her. The said fund transactions with ZSL were contended to be for a land deal entered into during April 2012 for establishment of a Disaster Recovery Site (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018DRS\\\\\\\\u2019). However, neither any disclosure was made to the stock exchanges or to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (\\\\\\\\u2018hereinafter referred to as MCA\\\\\\\\u2019) regarding such a land deal nor such transactions were reflected as \\\\\\\\u2018related party transactions\\\\\\\\u2019 in the Annual Report of ZSL for the Financial Year (for short \\\\\\\\u201cFY\") 2011-12. Similar such fund transactions were also observed to have taken place in the bank accounts of Sthithi. It, therefore, appears that Aditicon and Effica were used by Noticees no. 3 to 6 for the purpose of routing funds to Sthithi and Sripriya, and that ZSL had funded Sripriya and Sthithi to trade in violation of the provisions of section 77(2) of Companies Act, 1956, in its own shares i.e. ZSL. (10) As per the annual report of ZSL for the FY 2011-12, Sthithi was mentioned under the list of related parties of ZSL and was described as \\\\\\\\u201cEnterprise influenced by Key Management Personnel\\\\\\\\u201d. However, none of the transactions taken place between ZSL and Sthithi during the said FY had been disclosed under the head \\\\\\\\u201crelated party transactions\\\\\\\\u201d in the said annual report. Further, it has been noticed that the transactions of ZSL with Sthithi had not been taken into consideration in the consolidated figures of creditors and debtors of ZSL in the annual report for FY 2011-12. It, therefore, appears that by funding Sthithi\\\\\\\\u2019s trades in the scrip of ZSL and not disclosing the said transactions under the category of \\\\\\\\u2018related party transactions\\\\\\\\u2019 in annual report for FY 2011-12, ZSL published falseOrder in the matter of Zylog Systems Ltd.   Page 9 of 167 and misleading information and also indulged in fraudulent and unfair trade practices, thereby, violating the provisions of section 12A(a), (b), (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(f) & (r) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003 and section 21 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018the SCRA, 1956\\\\\\\\u2019) read with Clauses 32 & 49 of the Listing Agreement.  (11) Further, Sudarshan, Ramanujam and Srihari, by falsely vouching for the accuracy of the financial statements in the annual report for FY 2011-12, appear to have aided and abetted ZSL in publication of the aforesaid false and misleading information, thereby violating the provisions of sections 12A(a), (b), (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(2)(f) & (r) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  (12) Several emails were sent by Srikanth to various entities in relation to the fund and share transactions in the account of Sripriya, copy of which were marked to Sudarshan, Ramanujam and Srihari. At the same time, various emails were also found to have been circulated amongst Sudarshan, Ramanujam, Srikanth and Srihari, wherein they were discussing the share transactions as well as fund details in the accounts of Sripriya and Sthithi.  (13) It thus appears that Srikanth was handling the transactions in the accounts viz. demat accounts, trading accounts as well as Bank accounts of Sripriya and Sthithi. Further, Sudarshan, Ramanujam and Srihari were well aware of the said transactions taking place in the accounts of Sthithi and Sripriya and Aditicon and Effica, all of which, by lending their accounts for routing funds to Sripriya, aided and abetted the aforesaid funding of Sripriya\\\\\\\\u2019s trades in the scrip of ZSL making them as well as their directors viz. Noticees no. 10 to 12 parties to such fraudulent act. Therefore, it appears that the Noticee no. 1, Noticees no. 3 to 7, Aditicon and Effica as well as their directors viz. the Noticees no. 10 to 12 were parties to the aforesaid fraudulent acts. Considering the foregoing, it appears that the Noticee no. 1 and Noticees no. 3 to 12 had indulged in fraudulent and unfair trade practices while dealing in the scrip of ZSL during the InvestigationOrder in the matter of Zylog Systems Ltd.   Page 10 of 167 Period(IP), thereby violating the provisions of section 12A(a), (b), (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) & 4 (1) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  (14) In the quarterly shareholding pattern of ZSL for the quarter ended June 2009, Ganesan was shown as a public shareholder and he continued to appear in the list of the public shareholders holding more than 1% of the total shareholding of the Company. He was initially shown to be holding 2,28,998 shares of ZSL as on quarter ended June 2009. An investigation into his shareholding in the scrip of ZSL revealed that, out of the said 2,28,998 shares held by him, he had received 1,40,000 shares from Aditicon on June 15, 2009 in off-market transactions, and 88,998 shares in off-market transactions from Prabhudas Liladhar Financial Services Ltd. during period June 19 to June 26, 2009. At the same time, Ganesan was observed to have availed the margin trading facility and loan against shares facility from Prabhudas Liladhar Pvt. Ltd. and Prabhudas Liladhar Financial Services Ltd. respectively. The value of the loan against shares that was initially availed by Noticee no. 13(Ganesan) during May 2009 was INR 2 crores. While his annual income was declared as INR 12 Lakhs in the KYC document submitted with PLFS, the value of his trades in the scrip of ZSL was in the range of crores of rupees, which was highly disproportionate to his annual income. On the basis of various emails available on record, it is noticed that the Noticee no. 13 (Ganesan) has facilitated in the opening of a demat account and a loan account in his name with PLFS so that the same can be effectively handled & managed by Srikanth. It is also observed from the bank statements of Noticee no. 13 that large amount of funds, at times in the range of crores of INR, were received by him from PLFS which were later on transferred to ZSL and its connected entities including Aditicon and Effica. It, therefore, appears that Noticee no. 13 was also acting in coordination with the promoter group entities by helping them operate mule demat & loan accounts opened in his name and therefore, the shareholding pattern submitted to the stock exchanges wherein Ganesan (Noticee no. 13) alongwith Sripriya wereOrder in the matter of Zylog Systems Ltd.   Page 11 of 167 shown as a shareholder under public category turned out be a false and misleading information about promoter shareholding in the scrip of ZSL. Further, by lending their names, Sripriya and Ganesan, along with Srikanth, Srihari, Sudarshan and Ramanujam have aided and abetted ZSL in making false and misleading disclosure leading to the alleged violation of the provisions of section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(f) and (r) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. (15) As per the quarterly shareholding patterns submitted by ZSL to the stock exchanges for all the quarters of the Calendar Year 2012, the disclosed shareholding of the promoters viz. Sthithi, Sudarshan and Ramanujam were not matching with their shareholdings as per their demat statements. It appears that ZSL disclosed wrong information with respect to promoter shareholding to the stock exchanges in its quarterly shareholding patterns for all the 4 quarters of the Calendar Year 2012. Further, the shareholding of Sthithi, disclosed as part of the said quarterly shareholding patterns, include shares held in the name of other entities along with the shareholding of Sthithi. Further, as mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, the shareholding of Ganesan was shown as part of the public shareholding in the quarterly shareholding patterns, despite his shareholding being managed by Srikanth. From the above, it appears that by disclosing false and misleading information with respect to the promoter shareholding, ZSL has violated the provisions of section 12A(a), (b), (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), and 4(1), 4(2)(f) and (r) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003 and section 21 of the SCRA, 1956 read with clause 35 of the Listing Agreement. Further, by lending their names to various transactions and for opening of various mule accounts in their names, Sripriya and Ganesan along with Srikanth, Srihari, Sudarshan and Ramanujam had aided and abetted ZSL in disclosing false and misleading information with respect to the promoter shareholding. The above acts of disclosing false and misleading information is alleged to have violated the provisions of section 12A(a),Order in the matter of Zylog Systems Ltd.   Page 12 of 167 (b), (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(f) and (r) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. (16) In view of all the above, it appears that ZSL was being run and managed by four key persons viz. Sudarshan, Ramanujam, Srikanth and Srihari, who were known to each other well before the IPO of the Company was launched. At the same time, Srikanth was shown as an Independent Director in the RHP despite being directly and closely related to Srihari and Sripriya, and despite being a director in the wholly owned subsidiary of ZSL etc. The said appointment of Srikanth as Independent Director continued till 2010 and the Company continued to disclose him as Independent Director in various filings with stock exchanges viz. as a part of Investors\\\\\\\\u2019 Grievance Committee, Remuneration Committee etc., in his capacity of Independent Director as per the Annual Report for the FY 2008-09.  (17) Further, the directorship of Srikanth in Twinkle Natural Resources Private Limited was not disclosed in RHP. Therefore, ZSL, by submitting wrong information in the RHP as well as in disclosures to the stock exchanges, has appeared to have violated the provisions of section 21 of the SCRA, 1956 read with Clause 6.15.2 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u2018DIP Guidelines\\\\\\\\u2019) read with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issuance of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u2018ICDR Regulations, 2009\\\\\\\\u2019) read with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issuance of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u2018ICDR Regulations, 2018\\\\\\\\u2019) read with Regulation 49 of the Listing Agreement. (18) Similarly, by being signatory to the said RHP, Srikanth and Srihari, have also been seen to have violated the provisions of Clause 6.15.2 of the DIP Guidelines read with the ICDR Regulations, 2009 and the ICDR Regulations, 2018.Order in the matter of Zylog Systems Ltd.   Page 13 of 167 (19) Various irregularities in running the affairs of the Company including showing Aditicon and Effica as vendors, oral instruction being given to the staff handling desk functions, inadequate narration in the books of accounts of the Company for various fund transactions etc. suggest that the operations of ZSL were not being conducted in compliance with the Corporate Governance norms. (20) Activities relating to dealing in shares of ZSL by Sthithi, Sripriya and others including Ganesan were closely run and managed by Srikanth in coordination and agreement with Sudarshan, Ramanujam and Srihari. On the basis of various emails, it is seen that Srikanth was placing the orders/receiving confirmation of trades/interacting with the respective Brokers/NBFCs in respect of dealings in the accounts of Sripriya and Sthithi. Moreover, Srikanth had made arrangements with brokers to buy shares for and on behalf of entities related to ZSL. (21) During the course of investigation, the price of the scrip of ZSL had witnessed heavy downfall on October 18, 2012 on account of increased supply of shares due to invocation of pledge and subsequent sale of shares of promoters by IFCI Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018IFCI\\\\\\\\u2019) and Karvy Financial Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Karvy\\\\\\\\u2019) on account of non-payment of interest due to be paid by the promoters. Despite being aware of that, ZSL informed BSE on October 19, 2012 that it was having 'business as usual' and promoters were increasing their stake in the Company. Therefore, it is alleged that, despite facing severe financial stress and continuous selling of shares from the accounts of the promoters, ZSL made a contrarian disclosure falsely stating that promoters were increasing their shareholding and the Company was having \\\\\\\\u2018business as usual\\\\\\\\u2019. By making such a false and misleading disclosure, ZSL appears to have violated the provisions of sections 12A(a), (b), (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), and 4(1), 4(2)(a), (f), (r) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003 and section 21 of the SCRA, 1956 read with Clause 36 of the Listing Agreement. At the same time, it also appears thatOrder in the matter of Zylog Systems Ltd.   Page 14 of 167 Sudarshan, Ramanujam, Srikanth and Srihari were aware and were also behind the said false disclosure of ZSL and, thus, they have also violated the provisions of sections 12A(a), (b), (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a), (f) and (r) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  (22) Similarly, it has also been noticed that Sudarshan had quoted in a news article titled \\\\\\\\u201cZylog crashes 40% on pledged share sale talk; CEO blames crash on panic by speculators\\\\\\\\u201d, published in the Economic Times dated November 02, 2012, stating that promoters were increasing their stake during price fall period. He has further stated that there was no adverse impact on the Company's business. In view of the observations in the previous paragraph, it appears that Sudarshan had inter-alia given false and misleading statement in media and thereby has violated the provisions of section 12A(a), (b), (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a), (f) and (r) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  (23) Further, the promoters of ZSL viz. Sthithi, Sudarshan and Ramanujam had failed to make disclosures regarding their transactions in the scrip of ZSL as well as their pledge related transactions in the said scrip. Thereby, they appear to have violated the provisions of regulations 31(1) and (2) read with regulation 31(3) of the SAST Regulations, 2011 and regulation 13(4A) read with 13(5) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  (24) Similarly, Srikanth, being the whole time director of ZSL, has also failed to disclose the transactions of his dependant, namely his wife Sripriya, in the scrip of ZSL. Thereby, he appears to have violated the provisions of regulation 13(4) read with 13(5) of the PIT Regulations, 1992. (25) By funding Sthithi and Sripriya to trade in the scrip of ZSL and by making all the above-mentioned wrong disclosures as well as indulging in various other malpractices, ZSL and its connected entities have as part of a deliberate design or scheme, published false information and created a wrong impression before the investors that everything was all right with the Company and there was \\\\\\\\u2018business as usual\\\\\\\\u2019. In execution of the saidOrder in the matter of Zylog Systems Ltd.   Page 15 of 167 scheme, an elaborate misleading public impression was created by Noticees no. 3 to 7 about the Company and its shares with the active support and assistance of rest of the Noticees to defraud the common investors. It is therefore, alleged that the Noticees have violated the provisions of section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), and 4(1), 4(2)(a), (f), (r) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  (26) Further, as narrated in the foregoing paragraphs, Sripriya, Srikanth and Srihari appear to be persons acting in concert (\\\\\\\\u2018PAC\\\\\\\\u2019) with the promoters of ZSL namely Sudarshan, Ramanujam, and Sthithi during the Investigation Period wherein they were together holding more than 25% of shareholding in the scrip of ZSL as on March 31, 2012. The promoters of ZSL along with Sripriya, Srikanth and Srihari while acting in concert, together acquired more than 5% shareholding of ZSL on gross basis during the period from April 01, 2012 to December 31, 2012. In the said process of continuous acquisition of shares, the threshold of 5% was breached on two occasions- July 10, 2012 and October 08, 2012 during the Investigation Period, warranting making of a public offer under regulation 3(2) of the SAST Regulations, 2011 which Noticees no. 2 to 7 failed to make. Therefore, by making continuous purchase in the scrip of ZSL, the Noticees no. 2 to 7 acquired more than 5% of voting rights in ZSL during the financial year 2012-13 on two separate occasions, without making public announcement, as required under regulation 3(2) of the SAST Regulations, 2011 and thus appear to have violated the aforesaid provision. 5. Based on various findings of the investigation, as narrated above, a common Show Cause Notice (\\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) dated August 02, 2019 was issued to the Noticees alleging that: (1) ZSL, by making false and misleading disclosure on October 19, 2012, has violated the provisions of section 12A(a), (b), (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(a), (f) & (r) of the PFUTPOrder in the matter of Zylog Systems Ltd.   Page 16 of 167 Regulations, 2003 and section 21 of the SCRA, 1956 read with clause 36 of the Listing Agreement.

In respect of:  Noticee No.  Name of the entity PAN No. 1. M/s. Max India Research (Proprietor: Mr. Abhishek Gupta) BKEPG0910Q    1. The present proceedings have emanated from a show cause notice dated January 20, 2021 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) issued by Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) to M/s. Max India Research, and its sole proprietor i.e. Mr. Abhishek Gupta, (hereinafter collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticees\\\\\\\\u201d), alleging that the Noticees have carried out investment advisory activities without obtaining a certificate of registration from SEBI, in prima facie violation of provisions of Sections 12(1) and 12A (a), (b), (c) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \"SEBI Act, 1992\"), Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations, 2003\\\\\\\\u201d), and Regulation 3(1) of SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations, 2013\\\\\\\\u201d).   2. The allegations made in the SCN are as under:  a. SEBI had received a complaint dated April 04, 2018, against M/s. MaxFinal Order against Max India Research (Proprietor: Abhishek Gupta) Page 2 of 12  India Research, wherein it was inter alia alleged that the complainant had paid Rs.50,000/- for investment advisory services but had incurred losses due to their services. Based on the same, an examination of the complaint was carried out by SEBI.  b. From the KYC and confirmation obtained from ICICI Bank Ltd., it was observed that Mr. Abhishek Gupta was the sole Proprietor of Max India Research.   c. Max India Research has claimed on its website, \\\\\\\\u201cMIR is now a leading stock analysis and commodity analysis advisory company which provides expert recommendations for cash and future traded in NSE. We provide market recommendations through SMS and committed support team\\\\\\\\u201d.   d. Max India Research has various services on offer like- Stock Cash, Stock Future, HNI Cash, Bullions, Options, etc.  e. From the analysis of the bank account statement of ICICI Bank Account- 420405500032 of Max India Research, it is noted that credits of Rs. 5,83,669/- have been received for the period January 1, 2018 - April 11, 2018.  3. The SCN also called upon the Noticees to show cause as to why suitable directions under Sections 11(1), 11(4), and 11B(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 should not be issued against them for alleged violations. The Noticees were further called upon to show cause as to why inquiry should not be held against them in terms of Rule 4 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cRules\\\\\\\\u201d) and penalty be not imposed under Section 11 (4A), 11 B(2) for violation of Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013 and Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  4. The SCN also provided to the Noticees an opportunity to file their objections/reply, if any, within 21 days from the receipt of the notice. I note that the SCN could not beFinal Order against Max India Research (Proprietor: Abhishek Gupta) Page 3 of 12  delivered at the last known address available with SEBI, which is \\\\\\\\u2018Plot no. 4A, PU4 Scheme No.54, AB Road, Indore, Madhya Pradesh\\\\\\\\u2019, as provided in the KYC of the Noticee, obtained from ICICI Bank Ltd, where the Noticees have Account no.- 420405500032. Accordingly, the SCN was served through newspaper publication on March 15, 2021 in the Times of India, Indore (English Edition) and Dainik  Bhaskar, Indore (Hindi Edition), having  circulation in the last  known addresses of the Noticees. Vide the same newspaper publication on March 15, 2021, opportunity of personal hearing was also granted to the Noticees on April 27, 2021. However, on April 27, 2021, the Noticees did not appear for the hearing and neither did they file any letter seeking adjournment. I also note that the Noticees did not file any reply/objections to the SCN. Hence, I shall now proceed to examine the matter on the basis of the material available on record.   5. I note that the definition of investment adviser, as given in Regulation 2(1)(m) of IA Regulations, 2013, provides that investment adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Regulation 2(1) (l) of the IA Regulations defines investment advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d   6. I note that the Noticees had a website www.maxindiaresearch.com, which is currently not active. Copy of the webpages that were downloaded during examination of the matter have been provided to the Noticees as Annexure B to the SCN. From the pages downloaded, I note that the Noticees had claimed on their website that they are providing investment advisory services and that they offer a diversified range of services. The Noticees claimed on their website that \\\\\\\\u201cMIR is now a leading stock analysis and commodity analysis advisory company which provides expert recommendations for cash and future traded in NSE. We provide market recommendations through SMS and committed support team\\\\\\\\u201d. They also claimed on their website that they are providing various services on offer like- Stock Cash,Final Order against Max India Research (Proprietor: Abhishek Gupta) Page 4 of 12  Stock Future, HNI Cash, Bullions, Options, etc. and were providing premium stock cash calls, Nifty Future tips, intraday calls etc. with high level of accuracy. Further, I note that the pricing for the aforesaid services were provided on the website. Some instances of the service pricings are as given under:  S No. Intraday Cash                     Rs. 1 Monthly 5000 2 Quarterly 12,000 3 Half yearly 20,000 4 Yearly 30,000     HNI Cash 1 Monthly 20,000 2 Quarterly 45,000 3 Half yearly 80,000 4 Yearly 1,00,000     Intraday Future 1 Monthly 7,000 2 Quarterly 18,000 3 Half yearly 30,000 4 Yearly 50,000     Jobber\\\\\\\\u2019s Cash Pack 1 Monthly 75,000 2 Quarterly 2,10,000 3 Half yearly 4,00,000 4 Yearly 7,80,000     Commodity Bullion 1 Monthly 10,000 2 Quarterly 27,000 3 Half yearly 50,000 4 Yearly 90,000     Combo (Cash+Future) 1 Monthly 75,000 2 Quarterly 2,10,000Final Order against Max India Research (Proprietor: Abhishek Gupta) Page 5 of 12  3 Half yearly 4,00,000 4 Yearly 7,80,000  7. I find that these services were being offered by the Noticees in lieu of the consideration which could be paid by the investor concerned directly to the bank accounts opened in the name of Max India Research with ICICI Bank (A/c No. 420405500032) and Bank of Maharashtra (A/c No. 60289891942), the details of which were mentioned on their website and alternatively through PayU money. From the details of the ICICI Bank Account- 420405500032, it is noted that credits of Rs. 5,83,669/- have been received for the period January 01, 2018 - April 11, 2018.  From the aforesaid facts, I find that Max India Research was engaged in giving advice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, through its website www.maxindiaresearch.com. I note that the KYC for the ICICI Bank Account, copy of which was forwarded by the bank to SEBI, states that the sole proprietor is Mr. Abhishek Gupta, having PAN: BKEPG0910Q. Therefore, I find that Max India Research and Mr. Abhishek Gupta were giving investment advice, in lieu of consideration. In terms of Regulation 2(1) (l) of IA Regulations, 2013 such an advice is \\\\\\\\u201cinvestment advice\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Noticees were engaged in the business of providing investment advice to public, for consideration and were thus, acting as an investment adviser, as defined under Regulation 2(1) (m) of the IA Regulations, 2013.    8. Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 provides as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  9. In order to protect the interest of investors and to maintain integrity of the securities market, IA Regulations, 2013 provides safeguards to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected. One such safeguard is that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to obtain registration from SEBI asFinal Order against Max India Research (Proprietor: Abhishek Gupta) Page 6 of 12  required under Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013. Regulation 3(1) provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of IA Regulations. Further, safeguards provided under IA Regulations, 2013 includes continued minimum professional qualification and net-worth requirement for investment adviser, disclosure of all conflict of interest, prohibition on entering into transactions which are contrary to advice given for 15 days, risk profiling of investors, maintaining documented process for selecting investment for client based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s objective and risk profile, understanding the nature and risks of products or assets selected for clients, etc.   10. The activities of the Noticees, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that the Noticees were holding themselves out and acting as an investment adviser. However, it is noted that Max India Research is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of Investment Advisor. Hence, I find that these activities/ representations as being made by the Noticees without holding the certificate of registration as investment adviser are in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013.  11. In my view, unregistered investment advisors like the Noticees in the present case can put investors at great risk by misleading them. In the present case, Noticees on their website mentioned that Max India is a leading stock analysis and commodity analysis advisory company which provides expert recommendations for cash and future traded in NSE and that it provides premium stock cash calls, Nifty Future tips, intraday calls etc. with high level of accuracy. As stated above, SEBI Act, 1992 and IA Regulations, 2013 requires any investment advisor to hold a certificate of registration to act as such. I find that Noticees were not holding any certificate of registration from SEBI to act as investment adviser. Thus, the claims/representations made by the Noticees on their website were misleading and were made to allure investors to avail investment advisory services being offered by the Noticees. The Noticees have knowingly misrepresented on the websites floatedFinal Order against Max India Research (Proprietor: Abhishek Gupta) Page 7 of 12  by them that Max India Research is a leading investment advisory firm and it provides premium stock cash calls, Nifty Future tips, intraday calls etc. with high level of accuracy, without holding any registered Investment Advisor certificate, the Noticees have held themselves out as investment advisors and offered services through their website to investors with the objective of raising money. The above discussed misleading representations are deceptive activities of the Noticees and therefore, fraudulent and are covered within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d defined under Regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. Regulation 4(2)(k) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003, provides that  dealing  in securities  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  manipulative, fraudulent  or  an  unfair  trade practice  if  it  involves  disseminating  information  or  advice  through  any  media, whether physical or digital, which the disseminator knows to be false or misleading and  which  is  designed  or  likely  to  influence  the  decision  of  investors  dealing  in securities.  In the present case, Noticees without holding certificate of registration as investment adviser, knowingly hold themselves as investment adviser on their website. In the facts and circumstances of the present case, I find that the activities of Noticees are covered under Regulation 4(2)(k) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. However, I note that the SCN alleges the violation of Regulation 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and not Regulation 4(2)(k) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. In my view, as discussed above, the activities of the Noticees fall under Regulation 4(2)(k) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. Therefore, I find that Noticees have violated Regulations 4(2)(k) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  12. I note that the material available on record does not indicate the exact amount of fees collected by the Noticees,  as  a  result  of  providing  investment  advice  to investors,  in  violation  of  the  provisions  of  the  IA  Regulations, 2013.  However, I note that the complainant Ms. Vandana M Kotagi has claimed that she had paid an amount of Rs. 50,000/-to the Noticees, for availing investment advisory services from the Noticees.  13. I note that the SCN also calls upon the Noticees to show cause as to why inquiry should not be held against them in terms of Rule 4 of the Rules and penalty be not imposed under Section 11 (4A) and 11 B(2) for violation of Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013 and Section 12A(a),Final Order against Max India Research (Proprietor: Abhishek Gupta) Page 8 of 12  (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. I find that Section 15HA and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 which provides as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cPenalty for fraudulent and unfair trade practices.   15HA. If any person indulges in fraudulent and unfair trade practices relating to securities, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than five lakh rupees but which may extend to twenty-five crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such practices, whichever is higher.  Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided.  15HB. Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees.\\\\\\\\u201d  14. In view of the violation of provisions of SEBI Act, 1992, IA Regulations 2013 and PFUTP Regulations 2003 by the Noticees, as found in paras 10 and 11 above, I find that the Noticees are liable for penalty under Section 15HA and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992.  15. I note that while imposing penalty under Section 15HA and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 the factors enumerated in Section 15J are to be taken into consideration. Section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992 provides as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cFactors to be taken into account while adjudging quantum of penalty.  15J. While adjudging quantum of penalty under 15-I or section 11 or section 11B, the Board or the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely :\\\\\\\\u2014  (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default;  (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default;  (c) the repetitive nature of the default.Final Order against Max India Research (Proprietor: Abhishek Gupta) Page 9 of 12  Explanation.\\\\\\\\u2014 For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E, clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.\\\\\\\\u201d  16. I find that the material available on record does not indicate the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticees as it cannot be confirmed whether the credits of Rs. 5,83,669/- in the ICICI Bank Account- 420405500032 of the Noticees for the period January 01, 2018 - April 11, 2018 have been received only from investors for unregistered investment advisory services. Further, the material available on record does not indicate the total amount of loss caused to specific investors or group of investors, as a result of the default by the Noticees. However, I note that the complainant, Ms. Vandana M Kotagi has claimed that she had paid an amount of Rs. 50,000/- to the Noticees for availing investment advisory services. With regard to whether the default by the Noticees is repetitive in nature, I note that the Noticees were holding themselves as investment adviser without obtaining a certificate of registration as investment adviser. I note that in terms of Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992, a minimum penalty of Rupees Five lakh has to be mandatorily imposed on the Noticees and in terms of Section 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992, a minimum penalty of Rupees One lakh has to be mandatorily imposed on the Noticees.  17. In  view  of  the  foregoing,  I,  in  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  upon  me  under Sections, 11(1), 11(4), 11(4A), 11B(1), 11B(2) and 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Rule 5 of the Rules, hereby direct that:  (i) The Noticees shall within a period of three months from the date of coming into force of this direction, refund the money received from the clients/investors/complainant, as fees or consideration or  in  any  other  form,  in  respect  of  their  unregistered  investment  advisory activities;  (ii) The Noticees shall issue public notice in all editions of two National Dailies (one  English  and  one  Hindi)  and  in  one  local  daily  with  wide  circulation, detailing the modalities for refund, including the details of contact person suchFinal Order against Max India Research (Proprietor: Abhishek Gupta) Page 10 of 12  as names, addresses and contact details, within 15 days of coming into force of this direction;  (iii) The repayments to the clients/investors shall be effected only through Bank Demand Draft or Pay Order or electronic fund transfer or through any other appropriate  banking  channels,  which  ensures  audit  trails  to  identify  the beneficiaries of repayments;  (iv) The Noticees are prevented from selling their assets, properties and holding of mutual funds/shares/securities held by them in demat and physical form except for the sole purpose of making the refunds as directed above.

I find that these services were being offered by the Noticees in lieu of the consideration which could be paid by the investor concerned directly to the bank accounts opened in the name of Capital Money Mantra with ICICI Bank (A/c No. 185905000263), HDFC Bank (A/c No. 50200013713266) and Axis Bank (A/c No. 915020050222831), the details of which were mentioned on their website and alternatively, through PayU money. Details of the money credited into the various bank accounts held by the Noticees is as under:   Sl. No. Bank Account No Transaction Period Aggregate Value of Credit Transactions (in Rs.) 4.  ICICI Bank A/c No.185905000263 October 2015 to July 2017 24,32,546 5.  HDFC Bank A/c No.50200013713266 October 2015 to Oct 2017 82,94,402 6.  Axis Bank A/c No. 915020050222831 October 2015 to Feb 2017 12,11,452  Total 1,19,38,400 4. Credits through PayU Money 64,93,867  7. From the aforesaid facts, I find that Capital Money Mantra was engaged in giving advice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, through its website www.capitalmoneymantra.co.in. I note that the Account Opening Form for the ICICI Bank Account and HDFC Bank Account, copy of which was forwarded by the banks to SEBI, states that the type of profession of Capital Money Mantra is consultancy. I also note that the Account Opening Form for the Axis Bank Account, copy of which was forwarded by the bank to SEBI, states that the type of profession of Capital Money Mantra is Advisory service. The said Account Opening Forms for the ICICI, HDFC and Axis BankFinal Order against Capital Money Mantra (Proprietor: Gaurav Yadav) Page 7 of 11  Accounts further show that the sole proprietor is Mr. Gaurav Yadav, having PAN: AAZPY1259J. Thus, I find that Capital Money Mantra was the proprietary concern of Mr. Gaurav Yadav and was engaged in investment advisory activity. In view of this, I find that Noticees were providing the investment advice, in lieu of consideration. In terms of Regulation 2(1) (l) of IA Regulations, 2013 such an advice is \\\\\\\\u201cinvestment advice\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Noticees were engaged in the business of providing investment advice to public, for consideration and were thus, acting as an investment adviser, as defined under Regulation 2(1) (m) of the IA Regulations, 2013.   8. Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 provides as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  9. In order to protect the interest of investors and to maintain integrity of the securities market, IA Regulations, 2013 provides safeguards to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected. One such safeguard is that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to obtain registration from SEBI as required under Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013. Regulation 3(1) provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of IA Regulations. Further, safeguards provided under IA Regulations, 2013 includes continued minimum professional qualification and net-worth requirement for investment adviser, disclosure of all conflict of interest, prohibition on entering into transactions which are contrary to advice given for 15 days, risk profiling of investors, maintaining documented process for selecting investment for client based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s objective and risk profile, understanding the nature and risks of products or assets selected for clients, etc.Final Order against Capital Money Mantra (Proprietor: Gaurav Yadav) Page 8 of 11   10. The activities of the Noticees, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that the Noticees were holding themselves out and acting as an investment adviser. However, it is noted that Capital Money Mantra is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of Investment Advisor. Hence, I find that these activities/ representations as being made by the Noticees without holding the certificate of registration as investment adviser are in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013.  11. I note that the material available on record does not indicate the exact amount of fees collected by the Noticees, as a result of providing investment advice to investors, in violation of the provisions of the IA Regulations, 2013.  However, I note that the complainant Mr. Yavan Kumar has claimed that he had paid an amount of Rs. 76,000/-to the Noticees, for availing investment advisory services from the Noticees. Further, the complainant Mr. Amit Verma has claimed that he had paid an amount of Rs. 30,000/-to the Noticees, for availing investment advisory services from the Noticees.  12. In view of  the  foregoing,  I,  in  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  upon  me  under Sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B, read with of Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992, hereby direct that:  (i) The Noticees shall within a period of three months from the date of coming into force of this direction, refund the money received from the clients/investors/complainant, as fees or consideration or in any other form,  in  respect  of  their  unregistered  investment  advisory activities;  (ii) The Noticees shall issue public notice in all editions of two National Dailies (one  English  and  one  Hindi)  and  in  one  local  daily  with  wide  circulation, detailing the modalities for refund, including the details of contact person such as names, addresses and contact details, within 15 days of coming into force of this direction;Final Order against Capital Money Mantra (Proprietor: Gaurav Yadav) Page 9 of 11  (iii) The repayments to the clients/investors shall be effected only through Bank Demand Draft or Pay Order or electronic fund transfer or through any other appropriate  banking  channels,  which  ensures  audit  trails  to  identify  the beneficiaries of repayments;  (iv) The Noticees are prevented from selling their assets, properties and holding of mutual funds/shares/securities held by them in demat and physical form except for the sole purpose of making the refunds as directed above.

ItPage 13 of 178 is also observed from the letter dated December 28, 2010 of Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority to Euram Bank, a copy of which was forwarded to SEBI by Euram Bank, that Ashok (Noticee 5) was also a director of Vintage. x) In view of this, it is alleged that Ashok, being a director and owner of Alkarni Holding Ltd. as well as being a director of Vintage, is equally liable for the violations committed by Vintage. y) It is observed that, in terms of Section 11C(3) read with 11C(6) of the SEBI Act, it is obligatory on any person so summoned by the Investigating Authority to produce the necessary documents/information/appear in person to/before the Investigating Authority. It is observed that during the course of investigation, vide summons dated November 28, 2011 and March 21, 2012, SEBI, inter alia, advised IFCF to furnish details of beneficial owners of all its investors. In this regard, it is alleged that IFCF failed to provide the said information. Further, even though GDRs were transferred from Vintage and IFCF and both Vintage and IFCF are controlled by AP, IFCF vide letter dated April 2, 20212 denied any connection or agreement with Vintage and denied entering into any agreement contractually or otherwise with any entity for purchase, sale and conversion of GDRs of the Issuer Companies. z) In view of the above, Noticee 1 and 2 were alleged to have violated the provisions of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act read with Regulation 3(c), 3(d), 4(1), 4(2)(c), 4(2)(e), 4(2)(f), 4(2)(k) and 4(2)(r) of PFUTP Regulations. Noticee 3 and 5 were alleged to have violated the provisions of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3(c), 3(d), 4(2)(a), (c), (e), (f) and (k) of PFUTP Regulations. Noticee 4 was alleged to have violated the provisions of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act read with Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a), (c) and (e) of the PFUTP Regulations, and Section 11C(3) read with 11C(6)of SEBI Act. SCN to Noticee 5 to 17 aa) It is alleged that the complete process of issuance of GDRs and the subsequent conversion of the GDRs into shares were devised and structured by AP in connivance with the Issuer Companies. It is furtherPage 14 of 178 alleged that AP had orchestrated a fraud by devising a mechanism under which structured GDRs were issued by Asahi, Avon, CAT, IKF, K Sera Sera, and Maars which were subsequently sold after their conversion into underlying shares, through various entities which are connected to AP. bb) It is observed that the sub-accounts, namely, India Focus Cardinal Fund (IFCF) and KII Limited (KII) (hereinafter collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Sub-accounts\\\\\\\\u2019) which were allegedly connected to AP converted the GDRs held by them into underlying shares and sold the same in the Indian market. The counter parties to majority of such sale were CP group who were also allegedly connected to AP. A tabular depiction of the alleged connection among IFCF, KII, CP group and AP as mentioned in the investigation report is enclosed as Annexure to the SCN. Copy of the documents in support of the aforesaid connection is enclosed as Annexure to SCN.  cc) It was observed that AP, through one of the companies controlled by him, namely, Vintage FZE acquired all the GDRs of the issuer companies by utilizing the loans taken from European American Investment Bank (\\\\\\\\u2018Euram Bank\\\\\\\\u2019). In this regard, the securities for such loans were provided by the respective issuer companies by way of pledge agreement with Euram Bank wherein they pledged the GDR proceedings with Euram Bank. Thus, it is alleged that, effectively, AP was holding the GDRs of the issuer companies without incurring any cost. Thereafter, by way of converting the GDRs and selling the resultant shares in India, AP was able to monetize the structured GDRs. dd) It was observed that during the Investigation Period, out of the GDRs subscribed by Vintage, GDRs worth Rs. 1,20,17,33,280 were sold by it through IFCF and KII after converting the same into shares. Similar to Vintage, IFCF and KII were also allegedly under the control of AP. The comparison of GDRs acquired by Vintage to GDRs sold by it to IFCF and KII till September 21, 2011 are given below:  Issuer Date of GDR Issue No. of GDRs acquired by Vintage No. of GDRs sold by Vintage to IFCF and KII % of GDRs sold by Vintage to IFCF and KII to total GDRs acquired by Vintage Asahi 29-Apr-09 29,91,000 16,51,000 55.20Page 15 of 178 Avon 19-Jun-09 16,00,000 16,00,000 100.00 CAT 27-Jul-07 43,04,348 1,95,000 4.53 11-Jun-09 15,95,333 13,685 0.86 IKF 15-May-09 54,13,048 31,84,000 58.82 K Sera 26-Aug-07 47,61,900 32,56,900 68.39 16-Oct-09 44,75,238 13,85,000 30.95 Maars 8-Oct-07 73,80,000 20,75,000 28.12  ee) The details of the transactions of the CP Group with IFCF and KII till September 21, 2011 are given in the table mentioned in point (q) above. ff) From the said table, it is observed that the shares of issuer companies were not completely sold by IFCF and KII. Majority of the shares sold by IFCF and KII were purchased by the CP Group, only to be sold later. It is also observed that a range of 39.38% (IFCF in Maars) to almost 100% (IFCF in CAT) of shares sold by IFCF and KII were purchased by the Noticees. In total, IFCF and KII sold shares worth Rs. 1,20,17,33,278 of the issuer companies during the Investigation Period. Out of this, shares worth Rs. 79,11,13,054 were sold by IFCF and KII to the CP Group. Therefore, it is observed from the above that a major portion of shares of the aforesaid companies (around 65.83%) sold by IFCF and KII were purchased by the CP Group. Trading in Issuer Companies by the sub-accounts and the CP Group: Asahi gg) It is observed that there were 676 trading days during the IP 1 in the scrip of Asahi. The Sub-accounts started selling the shares of Asahi on August 21, 2009 and the CP Group started trading in Asahi from May 08, 2009. However, from May 08, 2009 till September 03, 2009, there were only 9 trades worth Rs. 15,729 between sub accounts and CP Group. The frequent trading by CP Group in Asahi started after September 03, 2009 only. In total, CP Group traded on 467 days out of these 676 trading days. Thus, it is observed that CP Group started trading in Asahi almost 10 days after issuance of GDRs. However, the significant trading of CP Group started 12 days after the Sub-Accounts started selling the shares obtained from conversion of GDRs in underlying shares. IFCF and KII had cancelled a total of 49.52% i.e. 14,81,000 GDRs issued by Asahi till September 21, 2011.Page 16 of 178 The below table gives the details of buy and sell trades done by CP Group and Sub-Accounts in the scrip of Asahi during January 01, 2009 to September 21, 2011: No. of shares purchased by CP Group and Sub-Accounts No. of shares sold by CP Group and Sub-Accounts Net volume of trading by CP Group and Sub-Accounts Value of shares purchased by CP Group and Sub-Accounts (Rs.)

The Noticee was running debt schemes inspected akin to Credit Risk Fund scheme and in a similar manner (in terms of investment strategy, credit rating, Macaulay duration, portfolio and Fund Manager) despite the investment objectives of these schemes being different.  The debt schemes inspected were projected as duration\\\\\\\\u2013based schemes instead of Credit Risk Fund schemes. B. The Noticee had not disclosed its strategy of investing in high yield securities with credit rating of AA and A to investors of the respective debt schemes inspected. C. The Noticee incorrectly calculated Macaulay duration, taking interest rate reset dates as deemed maturity date even though there was no explicit exit to both the parties i.e. Issuer and Investor, on the interest rate reset date.  As incorrect date was taken as deemed maturity date, the securities were valued incorrectly.  Further, the Macaulay duration disclosed to investors was also incorrect.  By way of taking interest rate reset date as deemed maturity date, the Noticee had accommodated many long duration securities in shorter duration portfolios and had managed to run multiple schemes with a similar strategy. D. The Noticee had entered into terms of investment which were ambiguous and without equal rights to both the Issuer and Investor. E. The Noticee did not value the securities as per the Principles of Fair Valuations, thereby not reflecting the true realisable value of the underlying securities. F. The Noticee had not disclosed change in terms of investment immediately to valuation agencies and credit rating agencies. G. The Noticee had made incorrect disclosures of the monthly portfolio of securities. H. The Noticee invested in illiquid securities without proper due diligence. I. The Noticee had made investments which were akin to giving loan to Issuers. J. The Noticee had not ensured independence of risk management function and also reduced the role of Business Risk Management Committee, without approval from its Board.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Asset Management Company Limited  Page 4 of 100 K. The Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s Board had not provided guidance or suggested any concrete steps to manage various risks (concentration, downgrades, early warning signal and liquidity issues) of the securities in the portfolio even though it was repeatedly reported to its Board. L. The Noticee did not have any policy on detail objective criteria to be recorded in the Investment Process Note (\\\\\\\\u201cIPN\\\\\\\\u201d).  Adequate documentations for investment decisions, were also not maintained. M. The Noticee did not exercise due diligence to ensure that investment parameters were analysed for individual Issuers (and not only at Group level), adequate documentations were maintained/obtained, terms of investments (covenant) were enforced, all material information about terms of investments (which had a bearing on the investments) were timely disseminated to unit holders. N. The Noticee had failed to ensure appropriate policy to have pro\\\\\\\\u2013rata allotment of partial buy\\\\\\\\u2013back to all the schemes and had managed liquidity across schemes by allocating partial buyback on non\\\\\\\\u2013pro\\\\\\\\u2013rata basis in the instances of partial buy back of securities, which benefited investors of one scheme over others.  O. The Noticee had allowed a SEBI debarred entity to redeem units of mutual fund. P. The Noticee had failed to maintain high standards of integrity, exercise due diligence, ensure proper care and exercise independent professional judgement as per the Code of Conduct specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Mutual Funds Regulations.  2.2 Several documents including the following were also annexed to the SCN to substantiate the allegations made therein, against the Noticee.

Clauses (a), (c), (g), (h) and (i) of the Code of Conduct as specified in the Eight Schedule Investment Valuation Norms Principles of Fair Valuation Mutual  fund  shall  value  its  investments  in  accordance  with  the  following  overarching principles so as to ensure fair treatment to all investors including existing investors as well as investors seeking to purchase or redeem units of mutual funds in all schemes at all points of time: (a) The valuation of investments shall be based on the principles of fair valuation i.e. valuation  shall  be  reflective  of  the  realizable  value  of  the  securities/assets.  The valuation shall be done in good faith and in true and fair manner through appropriate valuation policies and procedures. (c) The assets held by the mutual funds shall be consistently valued according to the policies and procedures. The policies and procedures shall describe the process to deal with exceptional events where market quotations are no longer reliable for a particular security. (g) The responsibility of true and fairness of valuation and correct NAV shall be of the asset  management  company,  irrespective  of  disclosure  of  the approved  valuation policies and procedures i.e. if the established policies and procedures of valuation do  not  result  in  fair/  appropriate  valuation,  the  asset  management  company  shall deviate  from the established policies  and procedures in order to value the  assets/ securities at fair value:  Provided  that  any  deviation  from  the  disclosed  valuation  policy  and procedures may be allowed with appropriate reporting to Board of Trustees and the Board of the asset management company and appropriate disclosures to investors.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Asset Management Company Limited  Page 7 of 100 (h) The asset management company shall have policies and procedures to detect and prevent incorrect valuation. (i) Documentation of rationale for valuation including inter scheme transfers shall be maintained and preserved by the asset management company as per Regulation 50 of these regulations to enable audit trail. SEBI CIRCULAR NO. MFD/CIR/6/73/2000 DATED JULY 27, 2000 Sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 25 of Mutual Funds Regulations stipulates that the asset management company (AMC) shall exercise due diligence and care in all its investment decisions as would be exercised by other persons engaged in the same business. With a purpose to implement the regulation in an effective manner and to bring about transparency in investment decisions, the AMCs are hereby advised to maintain records in support of each investment decision which will indicate the data, facts and opinion leading to that decision. While the AMC boards can prescribe broad parameters for investments, it is important that the basis for taking individual scrip-wise investment decision in equity and debt securities should be recorded. While there should be a detailed research report analysing various factors for each investment decision taken for the first time, the reasons for subsequent purchase and sales in the same scrip should be recorded. The contents of the research reports may be decided by the asset management companies and the trustees.  AMC boards may develop a mechanism to verify that due diligence is being exercised while making investment decisions. They may pay specific attention in case of investment in unlisted and privately placed securities, unrated debt securities, NPAs, transactions where associates are involved and the instances where there is poor performance of the schemes.  SEBI CIRCULAR NO. MFD/CIR/8/92/2000 DATED SEPTEMBER 18, 2000  Valuation of securities with Put/Call Options The option embedded securities would be valued as follows: Securities with call option: The securities with call option shall be valued at the lower of the value as obtained by valuing the security to final maturity and valuing the security to call option. In case there are multiple call options, the lowest value obtained by valuing to the various call dates and valuing to the maturity date is to be taken as the value of the instrument. Securities with Put option:___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Asset Management Company Limited  Page 8 of 100 The securities with put option shall be valued at the higher of the value as obtained by valuing the security to final maturity and valuing the security to put option. In case there are multiple put options, the highest value obtained by valuing to the various put dates and valuing to the maturity date is to be taken as the value of the instruments. Securities with both Put and Call option on the same day: The securities with both Put and Call option on the same day would be deemed to mature on the Put/Call day and would be valued accordingly. SEBI CIRCULAR NO.  MFD/CIR/15/19133/2002 DATED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 Risk Management Function  The Mutual Fund should have an independent risk management function consisting of one or more risk managers. \\\\\\\\u2026 The function should be separate from fund management and should report to the Chief Executive Officer of the AMC. \\\\\\\\u2026 SEBI CIRCULAR NO. SEBI/HO/IMD/DF3/CIR/P/2017/114 DATED OCTOBER 6, 2017 It is desirable that different schemes launched by a Mutual Fund are clearly distinct in terms of asset allocation, investment strategy etc. Further, there is a need to bring in uniformity in the characteristics of similar type of schemes launched by different Mutual Funds. This would ensure that an investor of Mutual Funds is able to evaluate the different options available, before taking an informed decision to invest in a scheme. \\\\\\\\u2026 Process to be followed for categorization and rationalization of schemes:  a. Only one scheme per category would be permitted, except:  i. Index Funds/ ETFs replicating/ tracking different indices;  ii. Fund of Funds having different underlying schemes; and  iii. Sectoral/ thematic funds investing in different sectors/ themes  b. Mutual Funds would be required to analyze each of their existing schemes in light of the list of categories stated herein and submit their proposals to SEBI after obtaining due approvals from their Trustees as early as possible but not later than 2 months from the date of this circular.  c. The aforesaid proposals of the Mutual Funds would also include the proposed course of action (viz., winding up, merger, fundamental attribute change etc.) in respect of the existing similar schemes as well as those that are not in alignment to the categories stated herein.  d. Subsequent to the observations issued by SEBI on the proposals, Mutual Funds would have to carry out the necessary changes in all respects within a maximum period of 3 months from the date of such observation.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Asset Management Company Limited  Page 9 of 100 e. Where there is a merger of schemes/change of fundamental attribute(s) of a scheme (as laid down under SEBI Circular No. IIMARP/MF/CIR/01/294/98 dated February 4, 1998), the AMCs would be required to comply with Regulation 18 (15A) of SEBI (Mutual Funds Regulation, 1996).  f. Mutual Funds are advised to strictly adhere to the scheme characteristics stated herein as well as to the spirit of this circular. Mutual Funds must ensure that the schemes so devised should not result in duplication/minor modifications of other schemes offered by them. The decision of SEBI in this regard shall be binding on all the mutual funds.  SEBI CIRCULAR NO. SEBI/HO/IMD/DF3/CIR/P/2017/126 DATED DECEMBER 4, 2017 SEBI, vide Circular no.

Directions for \\\\\\\\u2013    i. Suspension of launching of any scheme(s) for a specified period;  ii. Refund of the investment management and advisory fees to the debt schemes inspected from the effective date of the SEBI Categorization Circulars in respect of the said schemes.   B. Monetary penalty, in exercise of SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s powers under Sections 11(4A) and 11B(2) of the SEBI Act read with Sections 15A(b), 15D(b), 15D(f), 15E and 15HB of the aforesaid Act.  2.5 The Noticee replied to the SCN vide a letter dated January 22, 2021.    PERSONAL HEARING:   3.1 Thereafter, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on March 17, 18 and 19, 2021, through video conferencing on the WebEx App.  The Noticee was represented by Shri Janak Dwarkadas, Senior Counsel, Shri Mustafa Doctor, Senior Counsel, along with Shri Saurabh Gangrade, Chief Compliance Officer, FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC.  The Noticee reiterated the submissions contained in its reply dated January 22, 2021 and also made additional oral submissions. The Noticee was granted two weeks\\\\\\\\u2019 time to file additional written submissions, which it did so vide a letter dated April 5, 2021.    3.2 The allegations in the SCN and the submissions/contentions raised by the Noticee in its reply/additional submissions are being considered at length in seriatim while examining each issue identified for the purpose of this Order.  Before getting into the merits, I would like to deal with certain preliminary objections raised by the Noticee.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Asset Management Company Limited  Page 11 of 100 PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS RAISED BY THE NOTICEE:   4.1 To begin with, the Noticees have raised certain preliminary objections to the instant proceedings, such as (a) lack of clarity in the charges contained in the SCN, (b) Circulars alleged to have been violated are \\\\\\\\u2018Advisory\\\\\\\\u2019 in nature and (c) the procedure prescribed under the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Inquiry Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) has not been followed.  I would like to deal with these objections at the outset.    4.2 The allegations enlisted under paragraph 2.1 hereinabove, clearly summarizes the violations levelled against the Noticee.  Further, the SCN has brought out the analysis of facts and the circumstances that have led to such allegations.  Thus, I do not find any lack of clarity, as alleged by the Noticee.  The second objection raised is with regard to the binding nature of Circulars alleged to have been violated by the Noticee i.e. whether the Circulars are \\\\\\\\u2018advisory\\\\\\\\u2019 or mandatory in nature.  Primarily, the Circulars in question are all prescriptive in nature and are issued with the purpose of implementing the Mutual Funds Regulations and towards enhancing the efficacy and transparency in the activities of the asset management company with respect to its functions.  Given that these Circulars have been issued in furtherance of the Mutual Funds Regulations, they are undoubtedly binding in nature and hence, I do not find any merit in this objection.  The third objection pertains to non\\\\\\\\u2013adherence to the procedure laid down under the SEBI Inquiry Rules with regard to the issuance of two Notices (a preliminary one, limited to why an inquiry ought not to be conducted and a detailed one, for conducting the inquiry, upon satisfaction that it is required) to be issued at two stages for the purpose of adjudicating, before the imposition of any monetary penalty under the SEBI Act.  I find the said objection to be unsustainable, in the facts and circumstances of the case.  Moreover, in a given case of an adjudication proceeding under Sections 11(4A) and 11B(2) of the SEBI Act, which is combined with a proceeding under Section 11B(1) of the SEBI Act, there is a commonality of facts and allegations and in my view, no purpose will be served by separately following a different procedure for adjudging the penalty.  It is trite law that procedure is only a handmaiden of justice and cannot be made a stumbling block to substantive justice.  In any case, the Noticee has failed to show that any prejudice has been caused or that the principles of natural justice have been violated.  I am thus, inclined to reject the objections raised and proceed to consider on merits.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Asset Management Company Limited  Page 12 of 100 CONSIDERATION ON MERITS:    5. I have considered the SCN, the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s replies dated January 22, 2021 and April 5, 2021, the Forensic Audit Report along with all the material available on record.  I shall now proceed to deal with the violations alleged in the SCN in seriatim by detailing the response of the Noticee to the SCN; the analysis of the Forensic Auditor on the issue and conclude the issue with my findings on the same.    5.1 MULTIPLE SCHEMES RUN IN A SIMILAR MANNER:  5.1.1 The SCN has alleged that the debt schemes inspected were run in a similar manner on account of the following alleged similarities observed across the Schemes:  I. All debt schemes inspected had high exposure to securities with rating AA and below.  a. Each of the debt schemes inspected had taken exposures of more than 65% of their net asset to securities rated AA and below, which is the exclusive scheme characteristic prescribed for a Credit Risk Fund such as FI\\\\\\\\u2013CRF, consistently for a long time.  b. The comparative analysis of FI\\\\\\\\u2013CRF vis\\\\\\\\u2013\\\\\\\\xe0\\\\\\\\u2013vis the other five debt schemes inspected with respect to holding in corporate bonds rated AA and below is as under:    TABLE I \\\\\\\\u2013 % OF ASSET UNDER MANAGEMENT (AUM) SCHEME 31\\\\\\\\u2013MAR\\\\\\\\u201319 29\\\\\\\\u2013JUN\\\\\\\\u201319 30\\\\\\\\u2013SEP\\\\\\\\u201319 31\\\\\\\\u2013DEC\\\\\\\\u201319 31\\\\\\\\u2013MAR\\\\\\\\u201320 FI\\\\\\\\u2013CRF 82.90% 76.14% 75.96% 85.94% 97.99% FI\\\\\\\\u2013DAF 81.30% 77.27% 75.31% 86.09% 88.60% FI\\\\\\\\u2013IOF 73.34% 71.56% 78.67% 83.58% 96.82% FI\\\\\\\\u2013LDF 71.42% 70.94% 73.40% 84.04% 105.51% # FI\\\\\\\\u2013STIP 81.51% 74.72% 76.52% 79.84% 101.42% # FI\\\\\\\\u2013UBF 76.06% 69.46% 69.91% 72.68% 93.49% #DUE TO BORROWINGS, % HAS EXCEEDED 100%.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Asset Management Company Limited  Page 13 of 100 II.

The issue that arises for consideration in the present matter is whether the redemption of units in some schemes of a mutual fund by a director of the Asset Management Company of the Mutual Fund, and his immediate family, at a time when the said schemes were facing significant redemption pressure (the schemes were later wound up) and the director was allegedly in possession of material non-public information relating to the same, would fall within the scope of \\\\\\\\u2018fraudulent\\\\\\\\u2019 or \\\\\\\\u2018unfair trade practice\\\\\\\\u2019 as defined under the SEBI(Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices)Regulations, 2003. BACKGROUND 1. Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund (\\\\\\\\u201cFT\\\\\\\\u2013MF\\\\\\\\u201d) is a mutual fund registered with SEBI. Franklin Templeton Asset Management Company Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cFT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC\\\\\\\\u201d) is the Asset Management Company and Franklin Templeton Trustee Services Pvt. Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cTrustees\\\\\\\\u201d) acts as the Trustee of FT\\\\\\\\u2013MF.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund                                                Page 2 of 44  2. The Trustees vide notice dated April 23, 2020, informed the unit holders of certain schemes of FT-MF that it was winding up the schemes in conformity with the provisions of Regulation 39(2)(a) of the SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996 (\\\\\\\\u201cMutual Fund Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). The schemes that were to be wound up (\\\\\\\\u201cImpugned Debt Schemes\\\\\\\\u201d) were,- i. Franklin India Low Duration Fund (\\\\\\\\u201cFI\\\\\\\\u2013LDF\\\\\\\\u201d); ii. Franklin India Ultra Short Fund/Ultra Short Bond Fund (\\\\\\\\u201cFI\\\\\\\\u2013UST\\\\\\\\u201d); iii. Franklin India Short Term Income Fund/Plan (\\\\\\\\u201cFI\\\\\\\\u2013STIP\\\\\\\\u201d); iv. Franklin India Credit Risk Fund (\\\\\\\\u201cFI\\\\\\\\u2013CRF\\\\\\\\u201d); v. Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund (\\\\\\\\u201cFI\\\\\\\\u2013DAF\\\\\\\\u201d); vi. Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund (\\\\\\\\u201cFI\\\\\\\\u2013IOF\\\\\\\\u201d).  3. Subsequent to the decision to wind up the schemes, Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI/Board\\\\\\\\u201d) ordered a Forensic Audit/Inspection (\\\\\\\\u201cInspection\\\\\\\\u201d) in terms of Regulation 66 of the Mutual Fund Regulations and appointed Chokshi and Chokshi LLP, Chartered Accountants (\\\\\\\\u201cAuditor\\\\\\\\u201d) to conduct a forensic audit/inspection of FT\\\\\\\\u2013MF, FT-AMC and Trustees, particularly in respect to the Impugned Debt Schemes.  4. The data regarding the purchases and redemptions of units in the schemes by the key personnel of FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC during the period April 1, 2019 to April 23, 2020 was also examined by the Auditor and it was observed that Noticee no. 1 - Vivek Kudva (Director of FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC), Noticee no. 2 - Roopa Kudva (Wife of Vivek Kudva) and Noticee no. 3 - Vasanthi Kudva (Mother of Vivek Kudva) (collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d) had redeemed units in the Impugned Debt Schemes during the period.

SHOW CAUSE NOTICE  6. Upon consideration of the Auditor\\\\\\\\u2019s observations on the transactions by the Noticees, chronology of events and FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC / Trustees reply to the said observations, SEBI issued a Show Cause Notice (SCN) to the Noticees. The allegations made in the SCN is reproduced below,- a. Vivek Kudva in his capacity as a Director of FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC, was privy to information such as concerns of redemption, concentration and liquidity risk pertaining to the stress in the Impugned Debt Schemes, most of which was not in public domain.  b. In an e\\\\\\\\u2013mail dated March 18, 2020, Vivek Kudva had recognized and admitted that the stress in debt funds may need preparation for different scenarios and had requested FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC to share the liquidity profile stating: \\\\\\\\u201cDo send me the liquidity profile of the 6 managed credit funds ASAP, ideally by EOD today, if possible.  We are losing between 500\\\\\\\\u20131000 Crores per day from the funds and I want to make sure we are well prepared for different scenarios\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  Thereafter, on March 19, 2020, FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC had shared the information on negative return of the schemes with Vivek Kudva, which included the debt schemes inspected.  Subsequently, Noticee nos. 1 and 3 i.e. Vivek Kudva and Vasanthi Kudva, started redeeming their investments from debt schemes from March 20, 2020.   c. Vide an e\\\\\\\\u2013mail dated March 21, 2020, Vivek Kudva had specifically sought details of the Impugned Debt Schemes.  These details included latest borrowings of the schemes, % of borrowing at end of day, etc.  The information sought was received by him in an e\\\\\\\\u2013__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund                                                Page 6 of 44  mail dated March 23, 2020, forwarded by FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC.  The information contained in the aforementioned e\\\\\\\\u2013mail had inter alia identified exhaustion of borrowing limit of 20% by the FI\\\\\\\\u2013STIP.  At the same time, SEBI had approved increase in borrowings limits in the schemes, FI\\\\\\\\u2013LDF and FI\\\\\\\\u2013STIP, on March 23, 2020, beyond regulatory limits, pursuant to the request made by FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC vide an e\\\\\\\\u2013mail dated March 19, 2020.   d. On March 23, 2020, Noticee no. 2 -Roopa Kudva- redeemed all her investments from FI\\\\\\\\u2013STIP and a portion of her investments from FI\\\\\\\\u2013IOF.  Further, on March 24, 2020, Noticee nos. 2 and 3 i.e. Roopa Kudva and Vasanthi Kudva, redeemed all their remaining investments from FI\\\\\\\\u2013IOF.   e. Vivek Kudva was part of the Liquidity Review Committee, which was formed by FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC for assessing the liquidity crunch in the corporate bond market arising from the Covid\\\\\\\\u201319 pandemic and the resultant market dislocation.  Further, as per the reply of FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC, the said Liquidity Review Committee had received daily reports and held meetings/calls as necessary to monitor liquidity and discuss strengthening of the existing range of liquidity measures that the Schemes had implemented from March 27, 2020.  The daily reports submitted to members of the Liquidity Review Committee consisted of information such as inflows (pre\\\\\\\\u2013payments, maturity & coupon payment, etc.), redemptions and borrowing related data as well as projected cash flows and breach of limits related to borrowings, etc. pertaining to the managed credit funds.   f. Vide an e\\\\\\\\u2013mail dated April 3, 2020, Sanjay Sapre, CEO, FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC, had shared the fact sheets (as on 31.3.2020) of the six debt schemes inspected with Vivek Kudva.  In the said e\\\\\\\\u2013mail, it was stated that: \\\\\\\\u201cConcentrations have gone up as anticipated, though in some funds not as sharply as feared. Ability to sell down some of the top positions as we have been stating remains critical to the long term.\\\\\\\\u201d  On that said date, Vivek Kudva was left with an investment of around Rs. 10.70 Crore in FI\\\\\\\\u2013STIP.  The information shared with Vivek Kudva included the factsheet of FI\\\\\\\\u2013STIP along with the details of the rating and concentration of__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund                                                Page 7 of 44  securities.  The said investment was redeemed by Vivek Kudva on the same date i.e. April 3, 2020.  Post April 3, 2020, none of the Noticees had any investment in any of the debt schemes inspected.  g. From the pattern of transactions of the Noticees, it is observed that they had been holding units in two of the debt schemes inspected, viz. FI\\\\\\\\u2013IOF and FI\\\\\\\\u2013STIP, for a long time as no transaction was observed from April 1, 2019 till March 19, 2020 i.e. except the redemption of the entire holding of the Noticees on the dates mentioned in Table II at paragraph 9.   h. In its reply dated September 3, 2020, FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC had stated that: \\\\\\\\u201cVivek and his wife are settlors of two private trusts and primary beneficiaries of each other\\\\\\\\u2019s Trusts.  Each trust has invested Rs. 5 Crores (total Rs. 10 Crores) in Franklin India Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund-of-Funds (FD\\\\\\\\u2013AAF), as recently as 26 February 2020 and FD\\\\\\\\u2013AAF invests in the Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, which is under winding up.  Hence through the trusts, they continue to have significant exposure to the funds being wound up\\\\\\\\u201d.   However, the investment of Franklin India Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund of Funds (\\\\\\\\u201cFD\\\\\\\\u2013AAF\\\\\\\\u201d) scheme was open for redemption and were not part of the schemes under winding up.  Further, the Noticees had redeemed all their direct investments in the debt schemes inspected.  These redemptions from direct investments were during the period when Vivek Kudva was in possession of the non\\\\\\\\u2013public information and prior to the decision for winding up of the schemes, as taken by Trustees.   i. Further, FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC had in its reply dated September 3, 2020, submitted that the Noticees had also redeemed their investments from other Franklin schemes during the aforesaid period and hence, it would be incorrect to isolate few transactions and attribute motive to the same.  However, FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC\\\\\\\\u2019s reply is not acceptable as Vivek Kudva had specific non\\\\\\\\u2013public information while redeeming all his units from the debt schemes inspected.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund                                                Page 8 of 44  Accordingly, redemptions with respect to debt schemes inspected cannot be compared with redemptions from other schemes. j. In view of the above, Vivek Kudva, being director of FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC, after recognizing and admitting the stress in debt funds, had continued to seek and receive information from FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC, which was not available in the public domain and upon receipt of the said information, had along with the other Noticees started redeeming their investments from debt schemes inspected.   k. In view of the above, it was alleged that the act of redemption of units by the Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 3 in two of the Impugned Debt Schemes - FI\\\\\\\\u2013IOF and FI\\\\\\\\u2013STIP, while in possession of non\\\\\\\\u2013public information with respect to stress in the debt schemes inspected, amounted to an unfair trade practice in securities market and a fraud on the other unsuspecting unit holders of said debt schemes who were not privy to such confidential information and therefore, could not redeem their investments.  As a result, the Noticees had avoided loss (which shall be calculated as Redemption amount + Interest earned on the redeemed amount) with respect to the redemptions of their investments in two of the debt schemes inspected, viz. FI\\\\\\\\u2013IOF and FI\\\\\\\\u2013STIP, prior to closure of the said schemes.  Further, as a Director of FT\\\\\\\\u2013AMC, Vivek Kudva should have acted in a fiduciary capacity and should not have, directly or indirectly, sold or otherwise dealt in any units of the debt schemes in a fraudulent manner or indulge in any unfair trade practice in securities market, while dealing in units of the schemes which were under extreme stress and which were subsequently wound up by FT\\\\\\\\u2013MF.  Accordingly, Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 3 are alleged to have violated Section 12A(e) of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3(a), 4(1) and 4(2)(q) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (\\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations, 2003\\\\\\\\u201d).__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund                                                Page 9 of 44  REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 7. Subsequent to the issuance of the SCNs, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to Noticees on March 15, 2021 and March 16, 2021, wherein they were represented by Mr. Darius Khambata, Senior Advocate and Mr. Mustafa Doctor, Senior Advocate.  Noticees had also filed written submissions dated January 19, 2021. Noticee No.1 filed submissions on behalf of himself and Noticee No. 3, whereas Noticee No. 2 apart from adopting the reply filed by Noticee No.1 also submitted a separate reply. Noticees also made further written submissions which was received by SEBI on March 30, 2021, containing the summary of the arguments made on their behalf during the oral hearing. The summary of the submissions made on behalf of the Noticees is given below,- Noticee No. 1 and Noticee No. 3  i. It was submitted that the Noticees have neither effected any fraud or unfair trade practice and therefore any remedial intervention by way of disgorgement or imposition of monetary penalty is not warranted. The Noticees have neither gained anything/averted any loss for the same to be disgorged.  ii. Units of mutual funds are specifically excluded from the applicability of the PIT Regulations; SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s approach cannot be that PFUTP Regulations will cover activities which are specifically excluded from the PIT Regulations.  iii. SEBI has consciously decided not to extend the provisions of PIT Regulations 2015 to units of mutual funds despite the High Level Committee setup by SEBI to review PIT Regulations 1992 recommending that the definition of securities under the new regulations should be adopted from the definition of the term under SCRA which includes units of mutual funds. In view of the same, while accessing and inquiring in to allegations of fraud and unfair trade practice under the SEBI Act and PFUTP Regulations, the standard applicable to assess a charge of insider trading under the__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund                                                Page 10 of 44  PIT Regulations ought not to be applied. To apply such a standard would result in an incorrect standard being applied.  iv. The allegations in the SCN are based on the redemptions being undertaken on the basis of inequality of information, which is a characteristic of trading that is prohibited under the PIT Regulations. It was submitted on behalf of the Noticees that they have not dealt with the units on the basis on non-public information and that they have dealt with the same based on information available to all investors.  v. It was submitted that the charge in the present case is framed under the provisions of Section 12A(e) of the SEBI Act which reads as under: \"Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control 12A. No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (e) deal in securities while in possession of material or non-public information or communicate such material or non-public information to any other person, in a manner which is in contravention of the provisions  of this Act  or  the  rules  or the regulations made thereunder;\"  vi. It was submitted that Section 12A(e) applies when (a) a person communicates non-public or material information to another person; or (b)  deals  in  securities  while  in possession  of non-public information, in contravention of the SEBI Act, or the rules or regulations framed thereunder. The SCN does not refer to any other provision either under the SEBI Act or under any rules or regulations that refers to dealing in securities while in possession of material or non-public information.   No case has been made out against the Noticees under the PFUTP Regulations vii. The burden of proof to be discharged to prove a charge of fraud under the PFUTP Regulations is higher than the one under the PIT Regulations. viii. The charging provisions invoked under the PFUTP Regulations, i.e., Regulation 3(a), 4(1), 4(2)(q) have no applicability in the present case. It is a settled principle of law__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund                                                Page 11 of 44  that allegations in a show cause notice have to be interpreted very strictly, especially in cases of allegations of fraud, which can cause permanent damage to reputation and professional career of the person against whom they are made. ix. The scope of inquiry for the purposes of the current proceedings must be as laid down under the PFUTP Regulations, which requires SEBI to demonstrate that the redemptions were undertaken in a fraudulent manner or constituted a manipulative or unfair trade practice. In terms of the PFUTP Regulations, to prove a charge of fraud, it is critical to establish inducement.  In  the  facts  of the present case,  the Redemptions were not fraudulent as they did not and could not have induced anyone in the securities market or otherwise, to deal in the units of the Schemes. In terms of the SCN there has neither been any allegation against the Noticees nor has any evidence been adduced to indicate that the Noticees have induced any person to deal in the units of the Schemes. x. In terms of the PFUTP Regulations, 'inducement' requires a positive act or omission on the part of the Noticees. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the Redemptions gave the Noticees an unfair advantage, the same cannot tantamount to 'fraud' as there was no inducement. Had it been the case that the Noticees had made any public comments on the Schemes and made any representation on the basis of which an investor would have bought units of the Schemes, then that may have amounted to 'inducement'. However, in the current case, the transaction of redemption does not even involve any counterparty, who may be said to have been 'induced' in any manner. xi. Regulation 3(a) of the PFUTP Regulations prohibits a person from, directly or indirectly, buying, selling or dealing in securities in a fraudulent manner.  The term  'fraud'  has  been  defined under Regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations, the extract of which has been set out below:__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund                                                Page 12 of 44  (c) \"fraud\" includes any act, expression, omission or concealment committed whether in a deceitful manner or not by a person or by any other person with his connivance or by his agent while dealing in securities in order to induce another person or his agent to deal in securities, whether or not there is any wrongful gain or avoidance of any loss, and shall also include \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u2026 And 'fraudulent\" shall be construed accordingly.\"  xii. For an act to be deemed as fraudulent, it has to satisfy the essential features mentioned in Regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations. In this regard, the Noticees relied on the observations made by the L\\\\\\\\u2019d SEBI Whole Time Member in the matter of Nilesh Kapadia and Ors, which is reproduced below,- \"In this regard, I note that regulation 2(1)(c) defines 'fraud\" by providing an inclusive list of acts, expressions, omissions or concealments which shall be treated as fraudulent, by first identifying the features of 'fraud\" and then by providing an inclusive list of identifiable conducts/acts/omissions, which amount to 'fraud\". Thus, for a conduct to be 'fraudulent\" it has to meet the essential features mentioned in regulation 2(1)(c) and does not have to necessarily fall in any of the 9 instances stipulated therein\"  xiii. Reliance was also placed on the observation of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, in matter of SEBI v Kanaiyalal Baldevbhai Patel & Ors1. It was submitted that the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Court had in the matter had emphasized the factum of 'inducement' as critical for proving a charge of fraud. The relevant extract of the Supreme Court's decision relied by the Noticees is set out below: \"49. If Regulation 2(c) of the 2003 was to be dissected and analyzed it is clear that any act, expression, omission or concealment committed, whether in a deceitful manner or not, by any person while dealing in securities to induce another person to deal in securities would amount to a fraudulent act. The emphasis in the definition in Regulation 2(c) of the 2003 Regulations is not, therefore, of                                                  1 MANU/SC/1188/2017__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund                                                Page 13 of 44  whether the act, expression, omission or concealment has been committed in a deceitful manner but whether such act, expression, omission or concealment has/had the effect of inducing another person to deal in securities. 50. The definition of \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\", which is an inclusive definition and, therefore,  has  to  be  understood to  be  broad and expansive, contemplates even an action or omission, as may be committed, even without any deceit if such act or omission has the effect of inducing another person to deal in securities. Certainly, the definition expands beyond what can be normally understood to be a fraudulent act' or a conduct amounting to fraud'. The emphasis is on the act of inducement and the scrutiny must, therefore, be on the meaning that must be attributed to the word \"induce\"\". xiv. It was submitted that from the definition of 'fraud' under the PFUTP Regulations and the above judicial pronouncements, it is clear that for an act to be deemed fraudulent under the PFUTP Regulations, it has to meet the essential features of the definition of 'fraud' as set out under the PFUTP Regulations, including that the act should have induced another person to deal in securities. xv. It was further submitted on behalf of the Noticees that while the SCN makes a vague allegation of fraud, it does not specify the nature of the fraud that is alleged to have been committed with reference to Regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations. Noticees submitted that it is well settled that particularly in the context of allegations of fraud, it is necessary to set out in detail with sufficient particulars the allegations that constitute the alleged fraud as also the legal provisions under which the charge is being made. In the absence of either one of the above, the charge of fraud is not sustainable. xvi. It was further submitted that the Redemptions undertaken were not and could not have been an inducement to anyone to deal in the units of the Schemes. The Noticees decided sell to their units in the Schemes based on, inter alia, generally available public information and in the context of an extraordinary market situation due to the__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund                                                Page 14 of 44  unprecedented black swan event of Covid-19 pandemic. The Noticees did not encourage, advise or in any way induce any person to deal in such units nor has SEBI alleged or provided any evidence to support that any investor was so induced.  xvii. It was submitted that SEBI has not discharged the burden of providing any causation and impact in relation to the Redemptions. The actions of the Noticees were not to the detriment of the other unit holders in the Schemes and have not caused any other person to deal in the units of the Schemes in any manner whatsoever. Therefore, the allegation against the Noticees that they have committed fraud on the other unsuspecting unit holders is wholly unsubstantiated. Redemptions cannot be construed as an unfair trade practice xviii. It was submitted that in order to substantiate a charge under 4(2)(q), it is necessary to prove that a person has dealt in securities, while being in possession of non-public information regarding (a) a substantial impending transaction in those securities, (b) its underlying securities, or (c) its derivative. xix. Noticees' contended that the discussion with regard to the winding up off the Schemes commenced only on April 16, 2020. The Redemptions were undertaken between March 20, 2020 and April 3, 2020. A charge under 4(2)(q) hinges on whether or not the Noticees had advance knowledge of a substantial impending transaction in the units of the  Scheme.  The SCN neither identifies the 'substantial impending transaction', if any, which formed the basis of the charge against the Noticees nor does it specify when the Noticees had allegedly become aware of this alleged impending transaction. Paragraph 11 of the SCN only alleges possession of information with respect to stress in the Schemes, which by any standards cannot be construed as a 'substantial impending transaction'.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund                                                Page 15 of 44  Redemptions were undertaken based on publicly available information for bona fide reasons and based on prevailing market conditions xx. Without prejudice to the above submissions, it was submitted that the Redemptions were undertaken in good faith and on the basis of publicly available information and that the Noticees did not act in a fraudulent or unfair manner.  xxi.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) received multiple complaints stating that requisite disclosures under SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992, (herein after referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018PIT Regulations, 1992\\\\\\\\u2019) have not been made by certain entities with respect to their trades in the scrip of the Santowin Corporation Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Santowin/ Company/ Noticee 1/by name\\\\\\\\u2019).  2. Thereafter, SEBI conducted an investigation with respect to the alleged irregularities in the scrip of Santowin during the period from January 01, 2011 to December 31, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Investigation Period/IP\\\\\\\\u2019). The company is listed on BSE Ltd (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018BSE\\\\\\\\u2019). __________________________________________________________________   Adjudication Order in the matter of Santowin Corporation Limited                 Page 2 of 28      3. During the course of investigation, SEBI observed that certain entities, including Mr. Ashok Gupta (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Noticee 2/ by name\\\\\\\\u2018), who was one of the promoters/ directors of the company at the relevant time, had transacted in the scrip of Santowin on multiple occasions during the Investigation Period. SEBI further observed that in respect of the aforesaid share transactions carried out by Noticee 2, he had failed to make requisite disclosures in terms of PIT Regulations, 1992, read with SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015, (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018PIT Regulations, 2015\\\\\\\\u2019).   4. SEBI also observed that Noticee 1, which was a listed company at the relevant time, had failed to make necessary disclosures, as required under Regulation 13(6) PIT Regulations, to BSE on multiple instances.  It was also observed in investigation that Noticee 1 had not hired its Compliance Officer as per the requirement laid down in Clause 47(A) of Listing Agreement read with Section 21 of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCRA\\\\\\\\u2019).  5. SEBI further observed that Noticee 2, who was the compliance officer of the company at the relevant time, had failed to ensure that the company made necessary disclosures, as received from promoters/ directors of the company, to BSE as required under PIT Regulations, 1992.   6. Therefore, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings against Noticee 1 under the provisions of Section 15A(b) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2019) and Section 23E of SCRA and against Noticee 2  under the provisions of Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act (both Noticee 1 and Noticee 2 are hereinafter collectively called \\\\\\\\u2018Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019).  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  7. Vide order dated December 29, 2020, SEBI appointed the undersigned as Adjudicating Officer under Section 19 read with Section 15I of the SEBI Act, __________________________________________________________________   Adjudication Order in the matter of Santowin Corporation Limited                 Page 3 of 28      read with Rule 3 of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI AO Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) and Section 23I of SCRA read with Rule 3 of SCRA (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 2005, (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCRA AO Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions of Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act and Section 23E of SCRA, the aforesaid alleged violations by  Noticees.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING  8. A show-cause notice dated February 25, 2021 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to Noticees under Rule 4 of the SEBI AO Rules and SCRA AO Rules to show-cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against them and penalty, if any, not be imposed upon them under the provisions of Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act and Section 23E of SCRA, for the aforesaid violations alleged to have been committed by Noticees.   9.

It was observed from the table above that Noticee 1 had not made disclosures in respect of the information received from promoters, directors to the BSE in 19 instances and also there were delayed disclosure for 4 transactions.   c. In view of the above observations, it is alleged that Noticee 1 has violated Regulation 13(6) of PIT Regulations, 1992, on multiple occasions by not making disclosures to the Company and BSE as required.  Violation of Listing Agreement by the Noticee 1:  d. Noticee 1 vide email dated January 03, 2020, informed that Mr. Ashok Gupta is compliance officer of Santowin. Noticee 1 also informed that Mr. Ashok Gupta is Bachelor of Commerce.

It was observed that the compliance officer appointed by Santowin did not possess the requisite qualifications. Thus, it is alleged that Noticee 1 has failed to comply with provisions of Clause 47(a) of the Equity Listing Agreement read with Section 21 of SCRA.   Disclosure violation under Regulation 13(4) & 13(4A) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations by Noticee 2: f.

It was observed from the table above that on 7 instances, quantity/value of the transactions of Noticee 2, exceeded either 25000 shares or Rs. 5 lacs. In terms of the Regulation 13(4) & 13(4A) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992, Noticee 2 had to file the disclosures to the company and BSE within two trading days of such transactions, if there had been a change in shareholding which exceeds Rs. 5 lacs in value, 25000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights, whichever was lower. However, it was observed that Noticee 2 has failed/ delayed in making disclosures as required.  h. In view of the above observations, it is alleged that Noticee 2 has violated Regulation 13(4) & 13(4A) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992, on __________________________________________________________________   Adjudication Order in the matter of Santowin Corporation Limited                 Page 6 of 28      multiple occasions by not making disclosures to the Company and BSE as required.  Role of Compliance Officer: i. As per the information submitted by the company, Noticee 2 was the compliance officer designated by the board for administration and monitoring of the compliances of PIT Regulations, 1992, during the examination period.  j. As per Clause 3.2 of Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices for prevention of Insider Trading, the compliance officer shall be responsible for ensuring that the company complies with continuous disclosure requirements, overseeing and coordinating disclosure of price sensitive information to stock exchanges, analysts, shareholders and media and educating staff on disclosure policies and procedure.  k. It was observed from the Table 1 above that Noticee 2, as a compliance officer of Santowin, had failed/ delayed to make necessary disclosures to the BSE which were received by the company under regulations 13(4) & 13(4A) of PIT Regulations, 1992 from promoters, directors of the company.  l. In view of the above observations, it is alleged that Noticee has violated Clause 3.2 of Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices for prevention of Insider trading provided in Schedule II read with Regulation 12(2) of PIT Regulations, 1992, for delay/ failure to make necessary disclosures to the stock exchange  10. The SCN was sent to Noticees through Speed Post Acknowledgement due (herein after referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SPAD\\\\\\\\u2019) and digitally signed email and was duly served upon them. Noticees were given fifteen (15) days\\\\\\\\u2019 time to make their submissions in respect of the allegations made in the SCN. However, no reply was received from them. Thereafter, in the interest of natural justice, vide email dated March 16, 2021, Noticees were granted an opportunity of personal hearing before the undersigned on April 20, 2021. Vide the aforesaid email, Noticees were also advised to file their replies to the SCN on or before date of hearing. Vide email dated April 19, 2021, on account of the ongoing covid pandemic, Noticees requested for extension in date of hearing. The request of Noticees was acceded to and they were granted another opportunity of personal hearing on April 21, 2021. Vide email dated April 21, 2021, Noticees __________________________________________________________________   Adjudication Order in the matter of Santowin Corporation Limited                 Page 7 of 28      again requested for extension of four (4) weeks in date of hearing, on account of difficulties faced due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The request of Noticees was acceded to and vide email dated April 21, 2021, they were granted final opportunity of hearing before the undersigned on May 10, 2021. Further, vide aforesaid email, Noticees were also advised to file their replies to the SCN latest by May 07, 2021. Noticees, vide letters dated May 08, 2021, submitted their replies to the SCN. In view of the difficulties posed due to Covid -19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, hearing proceedings were conducted online through videoconferencing. The Authorized Representative of Noticee 1 & Noticee 2 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018AR\\\\\\\\u2019) attended the online hearing and reiterated the contents of their letters dated May 08, 2021. Noticee 1, vide letter dated May 08, 2021, inter-alia, made the following submissions:  a. That it does not agree with the non-compliances alleged in the SCN. b. That another adjudication order dated June 30, 2017, has been passed by anther AO of SEBI against them mirroring facts of the present proceeding, and the period of investigation for both the proceedings are also overlapping. c. That they have already paid the amount of penalty, imposed in the earlier AO Order. d. That It would be highly unfair and prejudicial for an august institution like SEBI to make ordinary people like me to be subjected to repetitive monetary penalty for same set of violations, just by covering the narrow investigation period earlier and also by including selected trades (while excluding or ignoring other trades) following a selective pick and choose approach and then again undertaking an inquiry and adjudication for remaining trades by issue of a fresh and separate show cause notice like the captioned SCN. e. That there is inordinate delay in the instant proceedings. f. That initiation of adjudication proceedings by SEBl pertaining to a decade old period is unreasonable, time barred and the SCN ought to be set aside on this ground alone. g. That initiation of adjudication proceedings after such an inordinate delay causes grave prejudice to the noticee as the noticee has been deprived of full, fair and effective opportunity of presenting his case. This has also been recognized by the __________________________________________________________________   Adjudication Order in the matter of Santowin Corporation Limited                 Page 8 of 28      Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in Ashok Chaudhary v. SEBl (SAT Order dated November 5, 2008). h. That the Investigation period is almost a decade old, the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s ability to review and access the records to assess compliance requirement in relation to receipt of such disclosures from concerned persons and onward submission of such disclosures with stock exchanges has been greatly diminished. i. That several disclosures were already communicated under Regulation 13(4) and / or 13(4A) of PIT Regulations to the stock exchanges directly by the concerned persons, it is sufficient compliance on the part of the Noticee 1 as well, as the intent, objectives and essence of such disclosure requirements are in any case achieved. j. That there is lack of proper appreciation of facts of the case and the SCN has been issued in haste to somehow conclude the alleged findings. k. That trades referred in the SCN are not significant in terms of the value of trades and more particularly said trades did not have any material impact / change in the overall shareholding structure of the promoter and promoter group as whole and thus the impact of the said trades is highly insignificant in nature and were likely had no significance or of relevance to the general public or investors in making their investment decisions. l. That change in shareholding was covered in the quarterly shareholding pattern filed by the Noticee 1 in a more concise and relevant manner for the public at large. m. That under SEBI PITR 2015, the earlier triggering limits / parameters provided under the SEBI PITR 1992 were repealed to match up with the present market scenario and obligatory reporting circumstance that might be considered to have a material impact / influence on the investors decision making process. n. In respect of alleged violation of Clause 47(a) of listing agreement, Noticee 1 submitted that it was struggling for its survival in its business operations and financial position and thus it was finding it difficult to appoint a qualified company secretary as the compliance officer. o. That the requirement of appointment of a qualified company secretary under the listing agreement was directory in nature but not a mandatory requirement. p. That Noticee 1 had appointed one of its own senior director to act as compliance officer in absence of qualified company secretary. __________________________________________________________________   Adjudication Order in the matter of Santowin Corporation Limited                 Page 9 of 28      q. That no disproportionate gain or unfair advantage has been made by them as a result of such genuine lapse to make documentary disclosure and also there is no loss caused to the investors nor there are any investors complaints for the same. r. That there has to be sufficient compelling reasons for the imposition of penalty depending on the gravity of the violations and resultant adverse consequences suffered. s. The Noticee 1 requested to consider this case for complete waiver of imposition of penalty. t. That there was no ill-intent, motive or inducement for the Noticee 1 to indulge into the alleged violations with a view to derive any kind of benefits out of it or to deceive the investors as alleged.   11. Noticee 2, vide letter dated May 08, 2021, inter-alia made the following submissions:  a. The Noticee 2 submitted that it does not agree with the allegations alleged in the SCN. b. That another adjudication order dated June 30, 2017, has been passed by anther AO of SEBI against him based on the mirroring facts of the present proceeding, and the period of investigation for both the proceedings are also overlapping. c. That he has already paid the amount of penalty, imposed upon him in the earlier AO Order. d. That It would be highly unfair and prejudicial for an august institution like SEBI to make ordinary people like me to be subjected to repetitive monetary penalty for same set of violations, just by covering the narrow investigation period earlier and also by including selected trades (while excluding or ignoring other trades) following a selective pick and choose approach and then again undertaking an inquiry and adjudication for remaining trades by issue of a fresh and separate show cause notice like the captioned SCN. e. That there is inordinate delay in the instant proceedings. f. That initiation of adjudication proceedings by SEBl pertaining to a decade old period is unreasonable, time barred and the SCN ought to be set aside on this ground alone. __________________________________________________________________   Adjudication Order in the matter of Santowin Corporation Limited                 Page 10 of 28      g. That initiation of adjudication proceedings after such an inordinate delay causes grave prejudice to the noticee as the noticee has been deprived of full, fair and effective opportunity of presenting his case. This has also been recognized by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in Ashok Chaudhary v. SEBl (SAT Order dated November 5, 2008). h. That there is lack of proper appreciation of facts of the case and the SCN has been issued in haste to somehow conclude the alleged findings. i. That trades referred in the SCN are not significant in terms of the value of trades and more particularly said trades did not have any material impact / change in the overall shareholding structure of the promoter and promoter group as whole and thus the impact of the said trades is highly insignificant in nature and were likely had no significance or of relevance to the general public or investors in making their investment decisions. j. That change in shareholding was covered in the quarterly shareholding pattern filed by the Company in a more concise and relevant manner for the public at large. k. That under SEBI PITR 2015, the earlier triggering limits / parameters provided under the SEBI PITR 1992 were repealed to match up with the present market scenario and obligatory reporting circumstance that might be considered to have a material impact / influence on the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 decision making process. l. In respect of violation of Clause 3.2 of PITR Code, the Noticee 2 submitted that the Company did not have required qualified human resources and was struggling for its survival in the business operations and financial position and he was just designated as the compliance officer for the sake of another compliance and was not competent enough for the said role. Thus, in substance, he was not a compliance officer of the Company in its true sense and purpose. m. That the primary responsibility for ensuring compliance by a listed company under Regulation 13(6) of SEBI PITR 1992 is on the company itself in its own capacity. This intent and object is clear from the language used in Regulation 13(6) of SEBI PITR 1992. It would be absurd to hold the Company as well as the Compliance Officer responsible, in their separate and independent capacity, for default in such compliances, if any, when the language of substantive provision does not so provide for. n. The language of clause 3.2 of PITR Code is generic in nature when it uses the words 'oversee and coordinate disclosures' and PITR Code is generally meant for internal __________________________________________________________________   Adjudication Order in the matter of Santowin Corporation Limited                 Page 11 of 28      guidelines and for statutory allocation of responsibilities within an organization for ensuring effective compliance. o. Noticee 2 requested for a complete waiver of penalty or imposition of nominal penalty. p. That no disproportionate gain or unfair advantage has been made by him as a result of such genuine lapse to make documentary disclosure and also there is no loss caused to the investors nor there are any investors complaints for the same. a. That there has to be sufficient compelling reasons for the imposition of penalty depending on the gravity of the violations and resultant adverse consequences suffered. b. That there was no ill-intent, motive or inducement for Noticee 2 to indulge into the alleged violations with a view to derive any kind of benefits out of it or to deceive the investors as alleged.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES, EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS  12. I have carefully perused the charges levelled against Noticees in the SCN, oral and written submissions made by them and other documents/evidence available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are:  (a)Whether Noticee 1 has violated Regulations 13(6) of PIT Regulations, 1992 and Clause 47(a) of Listing Agreement read with Section 21 of SCRA. (b)Whether Noticee 2 has violated Regulations 13(4) & 13(4A) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992 and Clause 3.2 of Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices for prevention of Insider Trading provided in Schedule II read with Regulation 12(2) of PIT Regulations, 1992. (c) Do the violations, if any, attract monetary penalties under Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act and Section 23E of SCRA? (d)If so, what should be the quantum of monetary penalty? __________________________________________________________________   Adjudication Order in the matter of Santowin Corporation Limited                 Page 12 of 28      13.

Before going into the submissions of Noticees on merit, I would prefer to first deal with their preliminary objections of Noticees. I note that Noticees have, inter alia, stated that there has been inordinate delay in initiating proceedings against them and that initiation of adjudication proceedings pertaining to decade old period is time barred and such inordinate delay has caused grave prejudice to Noticees. The Noticees have also quoted orders of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India and Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Special Appelate Tribunal in support of their aforesaid argument. I find that the investigation in the present matter was initiated by SEBI in June, 2019 and was concluded on January 07, 2020. Vide order dated March 06, 2020, Shri B. J. Dilip was appointed as AO in the present matter. Subsequently, due to administrative reasons, undersigned was appointed as AO by SEBI vide order dated December 29, 2020. Thereafter, the SCN was issued to Noticees on February 25, 2021.  15. Thus, it can be concluded that there was no unexplained / unreasonable delay that would vitiate the entire proceedings per se. It is noted that Noticees have been unable to show any prejudice or impact which might have been caused due to the time taken to conclude the proceedings.

No. Name of the Entity  PAN 1 Ms. Pinky Kelva, Proprietor of M/s. Future Investment   ECYPK7182R       In the matter of M/s. Future Investment      Background    1. M/s. Future Investment (Proprietor: Ms. Pinky Kelva) (hereinafter referred to as the \"FI\\\\\\\\u201d/\\\\\\\\u201dNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) is registered as an Investment Adviser (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIA\\\\\\\\u201d) under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \"IA Regulations\") with effect from  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 2 of 36 August 8, 2017 under Registration No. INA000008242.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) had received a number of complaints against FI. Pursuant to the complaints, SEBI carried out an examination in relation to the affairs of FI. The examination entailed inter alia an analysis of complaints in the SEBI Complaints Redress System (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCORES\\\\\\\\u201d), documents/information provided by complainants i.e. WhatsApp conversations, SMS, emails, call recordings, etc. and information available on the website of FI, products list etc.    Consideration and Prima Facie Findings in SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s Examination   3. The following was prima facie observed from inter alia, the analysis of invoices issued to clients, emails exchanged between FI and its clients, risk profile documents of clients and communications of clients with FI\\\\\\\\u2019s employees (WhatsApp messages and SMS), information available on FI\\\\\\\\u2019s website and FI\\\\\\\\u2019s products list.  4.

Thus, in the absence of the details of the employees / representatives of FI, WhatsApp communications and communication by SMS available as material on record, it was prima facie observed, from the context / contents of the message, that the same is from the employee / representative of FI. Similarly, the emails received by the clients are prima facie observed to be sent by the employee / representative of FI as the email id from which it is sent has been sent to the client has the domain name of future  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 3 of 36 investment, for e.g., compliance@futureinvestments.in or is signed off as \\\\\\\\u201cThanks & Regards, Future Investment, Support / Compliance Department.\\\\\\\\u201d    5. Pursuant to the examination, SEBI passed an Interim Ex Parte Order dated September 29, 2021, (herein after referred as \\\\\\\\u201cInterim Order\\\\\\\\u201d) against the Noticee in view of the following prima facie findings.       5.1. FI has been promising assured / guaranteed returns / profit to its clients.  5.2. FI has been unfair in its dealing with the clients and has extorted money under different pretexts.  5.3. FI has been selling multiple packages to its clients even though the subscription period for products earlier bought by the client was not over yet.  5.4. FI has been selling advisory services / products to its clients without ensuring suitability of product / service in accordance to their risk profile.  5.5. FI does not consider the financial situation of the client. 5.6. FI has not sold products as per clients\\\\\\\\u2019 risk profile.  5.7. FI does not have a documented process for selecting investments. 5.8. FI has manipulated the risk profile form.  5.9. FI has sought user id and password of trading account of its clients which is not relevant for the purpose of selling products / services to its clients.  5.10. FI has not filed ATR and resolved the investor grievances as per the prescribed timelines.   6. In view of the above observations, it was prima facie, found that the Noticee has violated the respective provisions of the following Regulations as mentioned in the interim order 6.1. SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d);  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 4 of 36 6.2. SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d)  Service of the interim order, hearing and replies of the Noticee  7. Copy of Interim order dated September 29, 2020, was served to entity vide letter dated September 30, 2020 and a reply was received letter dated October 06, 2020.  8. Vide submission dated October 06, 2020, Noticee, provided details of assets and confirmation of displaying the notification with respect to SEBI interim order on its website. Noticee also requested personal hearing in the said matter.  9. SEBI, vide letter dated November 23, 2020, granted opportunity of personal hearing to the Noticee on December 09, 2020. The hearing was adjourned on Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s request to January 08, 2021 and same was communicated to entity vide email dated December 09, 2020. Subsequently, SEBI vide email dated January 07, 2021, rescheduled the hearing due to administrative exigencies and fresh hearing date i.e. February 17, 2021, was intimated vide letter dated January 20, 2021. However due to administrative exigencies the said hearing was again rescheduled to February 18, 2021 and communicated to entity vide letter dated February 05, 2021. Subsequently, the hearing was rescheduled to March 03, 2021, which was communicated to the entity vide letter dated February 08, 2021. Noticee attended the hearing held on March 03, 2021 and was represented by the authorised representative reiterating the submissions made vide letter dated March 03, 2021.   10. Noticee vide letter dated March 03, 2021, made the following submissions:  10.1. Non submission of relevant details sought by SEBI was due to personal issues.  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 5 of 36 10.2. The communication of Mr. Vikash Pushkar, on promised assured/guaranteed returns, vide email dated July 16, 2018, was send by an employee without the knowledge of the Noticee and brought to knowledge of Noticee upon the complaint being filed by Mr. Vikash Pushkar. The Noticee had taken immediate cognizance of the matter and resolved the complaint amicably by refunding the agreed amount and the complaint was subsequently withdrawn. The copies of proof of payments provided, along with copy of dispute resolution email received from Mr. Vikash Pushkar.   10.3. Noticee has denied communication of Mr. Raghav Kalva and Mr. Rajib Debnath with Noticee and has therefore mentioned that the allegation and observations made on the basis of said communication requires no explanation.  10.4. Noticee has stated that the interim order has categorically brought out that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s website mentions \\\\\\\\u201cit does not provide any guaranteed service\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cwith investment, your capital is at risk\\\\\\\\u201d. It may be noted that all clients visit the website before subscribing to the services. It cannot be deemed that Noticee has not disclosed to the investors about the risk associated with investment in securities market. Therefore, it may be concluded that, the evidence given by the complainant has no substance and has been observed in the interim order that a proper disclaimer had been given on the website of the Noticee.  10.5. In the light above facts, it would be harsh towards the Noticee to conclude adversely and charging it for violations of provisions of PFUTP read along with section 12A of the SEBI Act.  10.6. Noticee has denied communication with clients brought out in Para 12, 12.1 (Mr Raghava Kalva), 12.2 (Mr. Rajeev B.) of the interim order and therefore submits that it doesn\\\\\\\\u2019t require explanation  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 6 of 36 10.7. With respect to selling of multiple packages, Noticee has stated that, the client has opted for various subscriptions based on their free will and the Noticee has offered the same in the absence of any specific regulation. Noticee has also stated that, it had no malafide intention with regards to selling multiple products. The Noticee is committed to provide all services as subscribed by its clients. Further, there were no prevailing regulations restricting the sale of multiple subscriptions.  10.8. With respect to the allegation pertaining to instances where services sold beyond clients Risk taking capacity giving reference to complaint filed by Mr. Raghava Reddy Kalva, where, the client was offered High Risk Services (i.e., Option Premium Services) although the client\\\\\\\\u2019s risk profile is Medium Risk, the Noticee has stated that Risk Profile was forwarded on June 18, 2019 to client and the client opted for the Option Premium Services on June 25, 2019. In the aforesaid mail it has been clearly mentioned that as per Risk Profiling of the client, the client falls under the category of Medium Risk. The product which client is selecting comes under, High Risk Category. Still the client preferred to opt for High-Risk Product. Copy of the email dated June 18, 2019, is provided  10.9. With respect to complaints of Mr. Radharaman Dash and Mr. Sunil Semwal, respectively, Noticee has submitted that, the services offered to the clients are based on their risk profile. The Noticee uses a comprehensive scoring method based on responses of the clients. The risk profiling questionnaire was framed on the parameters such as: age, investment objectives, time span, income detail, existing investments and assets, risk appetite and tolerance, and status of borrowings/liabilities etc., furthermore, due care had been taken by the Noticee, in assessing its client\\\\\\\\u2019s ability and willingness for absorbing losses. The Noticee has stated that, moreover, due care has been taken to ascertain that appropriate weights are assigned to all answers.  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 7 of 36 10.10.  In the case of Mr. Radharaman Dash, it has been observed, that the client\\\\\\\\u2019s gross annual income is Rs. 2-5 lacs and erstwhile investment was less than Rs. 2 lacs. Therefore, it has been concluded that, the respondent sold the products without considering risk profile of Mr. Dash, the Noticee has submitted that, it carried out a proper risk profiling and provided the risk profile sheet. From the risk profile it can be observed that scores obtained by Mr. Dash is 82 and his risk tolerance is weighted as \\\\\\\\u201cHigh Risk\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, giving weightage merely to only few factors and concluding that due care was not taken and was unreasonable in assessing the risk profile, would be unjust. Further, from the extracted table of the risk profile, mentioned in the order, that the response of the client to Q.21 pertaining to Risk Tolerance is \\\\\\\\u201cHIGH\\\\\\\\u201d; and Q.27 pertaining to \\\\\\\\u201cHow he defines himself\\\\\\\\u201d as a \\\\\\\\u201crisk taker\\\\\\\\u201d, is \\\\\\\\u201cWilling to take Evaluated Risk\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, it would be wrong to say that the Respondent has not exercised due care and skills, diligence in ascertaining the risk appetite of its client. Noticee has submitted that, it has acted in a professional manner  10.11. Similarly, in matter of Mr. Sunil Semwal also, Noticee exercised due care, skill, and diligence in ascertaining the risk appetite of the client. From the risk profile of Mr. Semwal it can be observed, though client represented himself as a retired person, but the other parameters which he himself disclosed, while ascertaining the risk profile, leads him to High Risk tolerance capacity. The overall score of Mr. Semwal obtained is 81 which puts him into High Risk Category. Therefore, in the light of above, it would be wrong to say that the recommendations given by the Noticee, to its client, would not meet the client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment objective. Copy of Risk Profile is provided. Therefore, the allegation are denied.  10.12. In view of the explanation provided the Noticee has denied the allegations levelled in the interim order and submitted that it would be unjust and wrong to say that:  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 8 of 36 10.12.1. The products sold by FI to clients are not appropriate to the risk profile / risk tolerance of clients. 10.12.2. FI has not sold products / services based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s financial situation. 10.12.3. FI has not sold services as per the investment objectives and investment time horizon of the clients.  10.13. The Noticee has denied the allegation that, adequate disclosure of relevant material information was not made, stating that all material information, pertaining to the product/services offered were disclosed on the website. So, it cannot be concluded that, the Respondent has by any means concealed any information, with an intention to defraud the clients.  10.14. Noticee has denied WhatsApp communication of Mr. Mohd. Aquib Khan and stated that it had no information pertaining to Mr. Mohd. Aquib Khan having taken loan to pay advisory fees.  10.15. Noticee, with respect to communication of risk profile to clients, has stated that the risk profile of Mr. Vijay Parwatrao Andhale, Mr. Pranmaya Joshi and Mr. Radharaman Dash, was done in accordance with regulation 16 of the IA Regulations 2013, and that all risk profile assessments were done before giving advisory services to the clients and none of the clients disputed the Risk Profile and Suitability Assessment Report.  10.16. With regard to allegation of manipulation of Risk Profile Assessment, to sell high risk product. Noticee has submitted that, the risk profile form is filled based on the inputs given by the client and not based on KYC. Further, the client never disputed the information in the Risk profile form which was communicated to him. Therefore, it would be unjust to press that the Noticee is involved in manipulative activities pertaining to Risk Profile Assessment. Noticee has reiterated that, it has done risk profiling of the client before giving advisory services and same have been, communicated to the client. It cannot  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 9 of 36 be overlooked that, there was no dispute, regarding the risk profiling, raised by any of the client. Noticee has stated that, Reg. 16(e), does not specifically mentions a timeline for communicating risk profiling. Therefore, Noticee has denied the violations stating that, technical laps such as communication of Risk Profile, or not doing financial planning cannot be terms as fraudulent and unfair act.   10.17. With respect to the allegation of seeking non relevant information from clients in the interim order, the Noticee denies any such communication and activities mentioned.  10.18. With respect filing ATR on SCORES, The Noticee has submitted that, IA is required to file ATR within 30 days. However, the spirit of filing ATR within 30 days to is to ensure that cognizance is taken on the complaint filed, and mare filing of ATR doesn\\\\\\\\u2019t mean resolution of dispute. The circular doesn\\\\\\\\u2019t stipulate that the complaint filed be resolved within 30 days, and to deem so, would be an inaccurate interpretation of the same.  10.19. Noticee denies telephonic conversations mentioned in para 52-58 of interim order pertaining to certain clients. Further Noticee has mentioned that, since these communications are not relied upon to arrive at the aforesaid prime facie findings, it does not require comments.  10.20. With regard to suitable directions for contravention of provisions of PFUTP Regulations and IA Regulations in para 59 of the interim order, the Noticee has stated that, since telephonic conversations were not relied upon to pass the interim order, the same may not be made basis to pass such order.  10.21. The Noticee has submitted that, there are no pending complaints on which the order is relied upon.  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 10 of 36 10.22. The Noticee without going into nitty-gritty and merits/demerits of each complaint has arrived at amicable resolution with its the clients, the settlements were done as prudent business decisions and should not be treated as admission of any wrongdoing with the clients of the Noticee.  10.23. Noticee has disclosed all material facts in the Terms and Conditions, Invoices, and on its website.  10.24. Noticee in the light of furnished information, explanation, clarifications, and facts, has requested the following: 10.24.1. The Noticee be absolved from all charges as levelled against it. 10.24.2. Pass suitable order to remove restrictions imposed in the aforesaid order. 10.24.3. Any such other relief, as may be, pleased to be granted.  11. Pursuant to the hearing dated March 03, 2021, certain information were sought from the Noticee vide SEBI email dated March 03, 2021 and March 09, 2021. The following information was provided by the Noticee vide letter dated April 03, 2021: 11.1. List of Employees/Agents/Representative along with KYC details, engaged in investment advisory activities on behalf of Future Investment 11.2. Annotated Bank Account with summary of heads expenditure/income 11.3. List of contact number owned by Noticee.  12. Further the Noticee also made the following additional submissions vide letter dated April 03, 2021: 12.1. It has tried to discharge the duties in honest, fair and in diligent manner.  Noticee has collected all necessary information about clients pertaining to KYC, and Risk Profiling under set mechanism. 12.2. Risk Profiling were done prior to giving advisory services to its client. Noticee had adequately disclosed relevant material information while dealing with  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 11 of 36 clients. Noticee informed its clients about their risk taking capabilities and suggested its clients, suitable investment as per risk profile.  12.3. Different services offered by the Noticee has been disclosed on website and explained the features to the customer, and upon satisfaction, agreed to subscribe the products. The product have been designed with risk classification. There was no conflict of interest and Noticee complied all regulations specified for IA. 12.4. The lapses observed were technical in nature and Noticee had no malafide intention. The complaint filed were immediately resolved in order to rectify lapses/errors, during the course of provision of advisory services to clients. 12.5. With respect to para 3.15 of reply letter dated March 03, 2021, it was submitted that risk profile was communicated along with suitable products to client in due manner. The client after receipt of the risk profiling, chose high risk service on his own will. Any misinterpretation which lead to conclusion that written consent of client on his opting high risk service may please be condoned. 12.6. Noticee has further mentioned that in the instance of Mr. Vikas Pushkar, where it was observed that the promised assured/guaranteed return, the Noticee has agreed to refund the amount upon being appraised that an employee has emailed such commitment on his own notion. Noticees website clearly mentions that \\\\\\\\u201cit does not provide any guaranteed service\\\\\\\\u201d  Consideration of Issues:    13. I have considered the oral and written submissions made by the Noticee. The issue to be considered at this stage is as follows:   Whether in light of the facts and circumstances of the case, the findings of the interim order and the submissions of the Noticee in response thereto, the directions issued against the Noticee vide the interim order need to be confirmed, revoked or modified in any manner?  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 12 of 36 14. With respect to non-cooperation in providing information as sought by SEBI, the Noticee has stated that the same could not be made due to personal issue. I also note that during the examination phase even after repeated reminders there was no revert back from the Noticee making any submission for additional time or citing any reason for non-submission. I note here that being a Registered IA with SEBI, the Noticee is required to adhere to the Securities laws at all times and personal issue, that too unexplained cannot be an excuse for any regulatory non compliances especially when the entity did not ask for any extension of time. Due to the non-cooperation and non-availability of the information, the prime facie observations were made based on the available information. I also note that if information/document and replies had been made available in due course of time, it would have been helpful in arriving at more comprehensive findings and observations.   15. With respect to the circumstantial evidence of the communication exchanged between the individuals and the complainant being considered in the interim order as being made between the employee / representative of FI and the clients of the FI, I note that the Noticee has subsequently, provided the employees list vide its submission letter dated April 03, 2021. On analysing the submission of the employees list it is observed that individuals named in the communication provided by the complainants namely, (i) Mr. Rishab; (ii) Ms. Pooja; (iii) Ms. Shruti and (iv) Ms. Yamini, figure in the list of employees of the Noticee. Further it is noted that the Noticee has not denied in any of its submissions that the referred employees and clients in the interim order are not its employees or clients. Therefore, it is substantiated that the communication is between employees and the clients of the Noticee. Here a reference may also be drawn to the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court order in the matter of SEBI v. Kishore R. Ajmera (2016) 6 SCC 368, where it was held that,\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.It is a fundamental principle of law that proof of an allegation leveled against a person may be in the form of direct substantive evidence or, as in many cases, such proof may have to be inferred by a logical process of reasoning from the totality of the attending facts and circumstances surrounding the  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 13 of 36 allegations/charges made and leveled. While direct evidence is a more certain basis to come to a conclusion, yet, in the absence thereof the Courts cannot be helpless. It is the judicial duty to take note of the immediate and proximate facts and circumstances surrounding the events on which the charges/allegations are founded and to reach what would appear to the Court to be a reasonable conclusion therefrom. The test would always be that what inferential process that a reasonable/prudent man would adopt to arrive at a conclusion.\"  16. The consideration of the issues in light of the written submissions made by the Noticee is contained in subsequent paragraphs.   17. Promising assured / guaranteed returns / profit to its client:   17.1. The interim order has brought out that the Noticee was promising assured/guaranteed returns to clients and provided examples of communications between FI employees and three clients. The Noticee has admitted to the communication of its employee with Mr. Vikash Pushkar with respect to promising assured/guaranteed/profit returns. However it has contended that the same was sent without knowledge of the Noticee and on being appraised, the complaint was immediately resolved by making refund of the amount and the complaint was withdrawn. With respect to the other two communications with Mr. Raghav Kalva and Mr. Rajib Debnath on promising/guaranteeing returns, the Noticee has merely denied the communication without any reasons, justification, explanation or evidence. However, as per the material on record (Employee List of Noticee) the individual i.e. Mr. Rishabh communicating with Mr Raghav Kalra is employee of the Noticee. Therefore, the Noticee has admitted that its employee has promised assured/guaranteed return to the client in one of instance but has merely denied the communication in other two instances. However, Noticee has not denied that the communications exchanged is between its employees and clients, which is further substantiated through the submission of the  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 14 of 36 Noticee. Further, I note that mere denial of the communications without any supporting reasons/evidences to the effect that why the communications cannot be the communication of the Noticee, is not acceptable. On the contrary the existence of the communication and the material available on records (Employees List provided by the Noticee itself) substantiate that the communications cannot be simply disbelieved without any attendant circumstances being shown. Further drawing reference of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court order in the matter of SEBI v. Kishore R. Ajmera (2016) 6 SCC 368, I note that, the immediate and proximate facts and circumstances surrounding the events and the context of the communications and basis of preponderance of probability, reasonable conclusion through inferential process has been drawn, that the communication are of Noticee in this respect. Further, the reply of the Noticee is absolutely oblivious to this allegation and no explanation has been offered for the same.  17.2. I also note here that, in either of the scenario, the allegation is with respect to the fact that no assurance/guarantee can be made in securities market by IA and by promising the same the Noticee is misleading the clients. The Noticee has contended that, the disclaimer on market risk is brought out in the interim order which contains that, \\\\\\\\u201cit does not provide any guaranteed service\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cwith investment, your capital is at risk\\\\\\\\u201d, and has mentioned that, clients visit website before subscribing to our services and hence it cannot be deemed that Noticee has not disclosed to the Investors about the risk associated with investment in securities market. Therefore, the evidence given by the complainants has no substance in view of the disclaimer on website. I note here that, by merely making a disclaimer on the website that returns are subject to market risks, the Noticee cannot absolve itself of its liability in making such a reckless and careless misrepresentation of assured/guaranteed return to the clients through email and communications. Further, the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s conduct of promising assurance/guarantee return through communications and SMS, are 100% contradictory to the disclaimer. If its objective was not to mislead  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 15 of 36 investors, it should not have communicated such reckless and careless claims/promises in its service/products. Therefore, the Noticee cannot take shelter under its submission that it has given due disclaimer on the website while ignoring the direct personal communication of its employees which is 100% to the contrary, to the investors.  17.3. In view of the above and the finding in the interim order, I note that the submissions/contentions of the Noticee are devoid of merit and therefore cannot be accepted.   18. FI has been unfair in its dealing with the clients and has extorted money under different pretexts   18.1. The Noticee has denied communications with Mr. Raghava Kalva and Mr. Rajeev B, and mentioned that since it denies the communications no further explanation is required.  18.2. The extract of the communication in the interim order are as follows: WhatsApp messaging with Mr. Raghava Kalva (complainant):  27.06.19, 1:21 pm \\\\\\\\u2013 raghava: I payed what ever I have  27.06.19, 1:22 pm \\\\\\\\u2013 raghava: I took it from my father  27.06.19, 1:22 pm \\\\\\\\u2013 raghava: You know I struggle to pay 5k  29.06.19, 12:37 pm \\\\\\\\u2013 future Investment: and make the excuse of amount. I am just asking for 13570 only  29.06.19, 12:41 pm \\\\\\\\u2013 raghava: pay my money back  \\\\\\\\u2026  29.06.19, 12:42 pm \\\\\\\\u2013 future Investment: Non refundable policy  29.06.19, 12:42 pm \\\\\\\\u2013 raghava: What you did not say all this before.\\\\\\\\u201d   WhatsApp messaging with Mr. Rajeev B. (complainant):  \\\\\\\\u201cRajeev B: Mail was sent to me not clearing my querries.  FI (Shruti): U have to pay service amount remaining from profit that I will mail u.  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 16 of 36 Tax u have to clear now. Aftrr 72000 u have to pay after profit only.  FI (Shruti): There is no refund policy.  Rajeev B: Okay. You can deliver the same statement to SEBI, NSE, BSE, Indore Police and other Competent Authorities.  FI (Shruti): Sebi donot ask for refund if client is denying to take service ok Rajeev B: It was your responsibility to inform me before starting the things FI (Shruti): Ok no problem.. I will tell the tax department that u r not interested and your time is wasted.. so kindly block your service.  Rajeev B: Dear I have clearly informed you after making more than the necessary payments to you, you have declined my profile by stating that I need to pay GST 72000/- which had not informed earlier. I got a valid information from your side that due to no payment of GST, you have cancelled my profile.  \\\\\\\\u2026  FI (Yamini): sir we did not said it official  \\\\\\\\u2026  Rajeev B: what do you mean? Message received from official who is using office number is not an official message?  FI (Yamini): message is not count in official\\\\\\\\u2026. 18.3. As noted from the communications made, client has paid more than what was disclosed at the beginning of his service / package availed by him and the Noticee has not disclosed the full amount at the time of initial product / service selling to its client but gradually demands it from the client giving reasons that if the client does not pay the same then services will be stopped, profits will be lost, pretext of service tax and GST, etc. Further, complainants have mentioned no refund policy for the services availed and the IA did not respond to the communication for refund. Further, it is noted that the invoices mention that the \\\\\\\\u2018Payment is Non Refundable\\\\\\\\u2019 under \\\\\\\\u2018Terms and Conditions\\\\\\\\u2019 and that subscription charges once paid are non-refundable.  18.4. It is noted that though Noticee has denied the communications exchanged, it has not denied that Shruti and Yamini, are its employees. Neither did the Noticee deny that the recipient are its clients. Further it is noted from the submission of the Noticee dated April 03, 2021, and the available documents on record, that communications being exchanged is between the employees  Confirmatory Order in the matter of Future Investment        Page 17 of 36 and clients of the Noticee. The Noticee has also not presented any facts or documents, basis of which the communication should be disbelieved. Therefore, mere denial of the communications without any supporting reasons/evidences to the effect that why the communication cannot be the communication of the Noticee without contradictory facts, is not acceptable.  18.5. In view of the above and the finding in the interim order, I note that the submissions of the Noticee is devoid of merit and cannot be accepted.   19. Selling Multiple Packages  19.1. Noticee has submitted that client has opted for various subscriptions based on their free will and was offered in the absence of any specific regulation. Noticee had no malafide intention with regard to selling multiple products and is committed to provide all services as subscribed by its clients. Further, The Noticee has mentioned that, there were no prevailing regulations restricting the sale of ", "Date": "2021-06-03", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Confirmatory order in the matter of M/s.

The interim order was also in the nature of a show cause notice wherein the Noticees were provided with the opportunity to file their objections/reply, if any, within 21 days from the date of the interim order and also to indicate whether they desire to avail an opportunity of personal hearing on a date and time to be fixed on a specific request to be made in that regard. The Noticees were granted an opportunity of hearing on January 18, 2021 wherein Mr. Sanjeev Sigh appeared and made submissions. He was directed to place his oral submissions on record and vide a reply dated February 08, 2021, he reiterated his submissions as follows:   a. The SEBI examination is one sided and did not consider all aspects of the matter. b. He has not been given any details of complaints received against him. c. As far as he knows the basis of the examination was one complaint wherein the complainant had been cheated on the basis of a fake website bearing the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 name. d. In this regard the Noticees had taken up the issue of the fake website with the service provider \\\\\\\\u2018justdial\\\\\\\\u2019 wherein a fake page bearing the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 name had been floated and finally after follow up the page was closed. e. In his bank KYC his business had been indicated as \\\\\\\\u2018stockbroker\\\\\\\\u2019 as an error. f. He was engaged in trading of dead stock/ unsold securities investor of Final Order in the matter of M/s Wildstock (Proprietor: Mr. Sanjeev Singh)  Page 4 of 19  companies which were in compliance with SEBI laws. g. No SEBI official had ever carried out any inspection in his premises or taken any action against him. h. The bank transactions mentioned in the interim order does not tally with the Noitcees\\\\\\\\u2019 actual bank transactions. The transactions in the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 accounts amount to less than Rs. 20 lakhs and most of it is between the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 different accounts and thus appear large. i. The Noticees are undergoing great hardship due to their bank accounts being frozen during the pandemic.  3. I find that the interim order passed in the matter contained following observations with respect to the Noticees:  (i) SEBI received complaints against Wildstock inter alia alleging that its representatives had induced them to avail its services by claiming that if the complainants invest in stocks with their help i.e., avail the investment advisory services of the Noticees, they will get a good return. For this service, the complainants had to pay a certain fee depending upon the type of plan availed by them. One of the complaints stated that upon payment of the full fee, the Noticees asked for additional payments in the name of updating their risk profile. Further, one of the complainants alleged that the Noticees has stopped receiving his calls when he had asked for the invoices of the payments made by him and have also caused significant losses to him.  (ii) In view of the complaints received, SEBI carried out a preliminary examination to ascertain whether unregistered investment advisory activities are being carried out by the Noticees. To that end the website of the Noticees, www.wildstocks.in and particulars of its bank accounts were perused to gather information. Currently the aforesaid website is not active. On visiting the website the following message is displayed: \\\\\\\\u201cYour request cannot be processed due to pending renewal\\\\\\\\u201d. However, during the course Final Order in the matter of M/s Wildstock (Proprietor: Mr. Sanjeev Singh)  Page 5 of 19  of preliminary examination, print outs of web pages of the website was taken and have been placed on record. (iii) SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s preliminary examination found as follows: i. The entity is not registered with SEBI. ii. The website provides information that the entity offers products and services relating to equity market, future market, option market, index option and commodity market.  (iv) As per the archived information gathered from the website, inter alia the following claims are noted:  a. Under the heading \\\\\\\\u201cWhy wildstock\\\\\\\\u201d, the website claims as follows: \\\\\\\\u201cWe have been handling finances and investments for a long time and the hefty experience makes our experts the best in the domain area of Investments and the subsequent Growth. We at Wildstock also understand that each individual would have his own earning and investment patterns, which are primarily governed by the per-annul influx of money, and the liabilities that are targeted at the end of the maturity term. We offer individual plans to suit your needs and do not focus on one standardized investment plan.\\\\\\\\u201d b. Under the heading \\\\\\\\u201cServices\\\\\\\\u201d the website claims as follows: Extensive & detailed Research to guide all kinds of investors. Dedicated team of relationship managers.

As per the KYC documents of these bank accounts, the nature of business/ type of profession of the Noticees has been stated to be as follows: Final Order in the matter of M/s Wildstock (Proprietor: Mr. Sanjeev Singh)  Page 8 of 19  Bank Nature of business/ Type of profession State Bank of India Student Axis Bank Ltd. Salaried HDFC Bank Ltd. Stock Brokers / Stock Broking Bank of India Stock Market  b. From the KYC of account opening form of HDFC Bank Ltd., it is noted that the account is in the name of Wild stock and Mr. Sanjeev Singh is its sole proprietor. Wildstock was registered on 6/2/2018 under Shop and Establishment Act, 1958 with its registered office at B-3, 1st Floor, Vidya Nagar, Commercial Complex, behind Indian Oil petrol pump, Hoshangabad Road, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh \\\\\\\\u2013 462026. c. It is further observed from an internet search of the particulars of hosting of the website of Wildstock based on its domain name that the website of the firm was hosted for the first time on April 15, 2019 as available on www.whoisrequest.com/whois/wildstocks.in.  d. The transactions observed in the abovementioned bank accounts are summarized as under: Bank Name  Bank Account No. Account Opening Date Account status as on date Total Credit Received for the period mentioned State Bank of India  31146241699 26/4/2010 Active Rs. 10,69,789.03/-  From 15/4/2019 to 18/2/2020)  Axis Bank  915010055728735  15/1/2016  Active but  no transaction has taken place after 25/09/2019   Rs. 6,81,270.67/-  From 15/4/2019 to 4/2/2020). HDFC Bank  50200044312937 23/9/2019  Active Rs. 22,36,549/- Final Order in the matter of M/s Wildstock (Proprietor: Mr. Sanjeev Singh)  Page 9 of 19  Bank Name  Bank Account No. Account Opening Date Account status as on date Total Credit Received for the period mentioned    From 23/9/2019 to 4/2/2020.  Bank of India  903220110000361 23/8/2019  Active Rs. 9,59,436.18/-  From 23/8/2019 to 19/2/2020.   e. It is observed that there are large number of payments received through various payment gateways/ IMPS or NEFT. From the period of the transactions, it appears that the payments have come from various investors / clients in lieu of the purported \\\\\\\\u2018recommendations\\\\\\\\u2019 or \\\\\\\\u2018calls\\\\\\\\u2019 provided by the Noticees. f. It is noted that M/s Wild Stock and its sole proprietor, Mr. Sanjeev Singh are not registered in any capacity with SEBI.   4. Thus, the interim order observed that prima facie, the Noticees are an investment adviser as defined under regulation 2 (m) of IA Regulations. Moreover, interim order also found that the activities of the Noticees such as offering tips, intra day calls, holding out to offer customised investment plans to its clients as opposed to having a standard investment plan, advertising to empower the retail community by sharing knowledge, providing superior tools and great support etc., on payment of fees, indicates that it is prima facie also holding out that it is providing investment advisory services.   5. From the details of transactions processed through payment gateways, account statements of the relevant bank accounts, KYC records of bank accounts/ payment gateways, material available on the websites of the Noticees and the complaint, interim order made the  following prima facie observations:   i. Noticees are not registered as investment advisors with SEBI. ii. The Noticees have floated their website viz www.wildstocks.in Final Order in the matter of M/s Wildstock (Proprietor: Mr. Sanjeev Singh)  Page 10 of 19  iii. The activity of Noticees, through their website, of holding themselves out to be giving advice  / recommendation  in  relation  to  securities  being  traded  in  the  securities market  and  /  or  also  in  relation  to  commodities to  the  investors  and general public, and payment receipts of the complainants indicating the payment was  made  for  receiving  investment  advice,  the  bank  statement prima  facie, showing  the  credit inter  alia for  payment  of  fees,  indicates  that  there  is  a preponderance of probability that Noticees, apart from holding themselves out as investment advisor(s), have acted as an investment advisor for consideration. iv. The archived version of the website, as on the date of the interim order, reflect the bank account details/payment gateway through which the investors  desirous  of availing their services can make direct payment.  v. The website also gave details of QR code of e-wallets, viz.,  Phone Pe, BHIM, google Pay and PayTM.  vi. Credits  have  been  received  in  the  accounts  of  these  unregistered Noticees.  6. I note that the definition of investment adviser, as given in Regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, 2013, provides that investment adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations defines investment advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d    7. I note that interim order alleges that Noticees were engaged in providing investment advisory services to the investors through the website, www.wildstocks.in. It has been alleged in the SCN that the said website belonged to Wildstock which is the sole proprietorship of Mr. Sanjeev Singh. In this regard, it has been contended by Final Order in the matter of M/s Wildstock (Proprietor: Mr. Sanjeev Singh)  Page 11 of 19  the Noticees that it was a fake website and their names were misused for which they have taken up the matter with \\\\\\\\u2018Justdial\\\\\\\\u2019 and now this fake webpage is closed. Thus, in effect, Noticees have denied their connection with the website. Firstly, I note that \\\\\\\\u2018Justdial\\\\\\\\u2019 is not a domain provider. Justdial is only a database of business listings. Thus, \\\\\\\\u2018Justdial\\\\\\\\u2019 only provide the details of the businesses already in operation which have been enlisted on its platform by the owners of such business. Therefore, removing of any listing from the platform of \\\\\\\\u201cJustdial\\\\\\\\u201d merely indicates that prior to removal, such business was in existence. Interim order states that presently, the website is not active and during the preliminary examination of SEBI the said website was active when the printouts of its pages were taken by SEBI. Therefore, removal of listing of business of Noticees from \\\\\\\\u201cJustdial\\\\\\\\u201d is not of any consequence for the determination of present proceedings. I note that on the website four bank accounts viz: State Bank of India Bank Account No. 31146241699 (held in the name of Sanjeev Singh), Axis Bank Account No. 915010055728735 (held in the name of Sanjeev Singh)), HDFC Bank Account no. 50200044312937 (held in the name of Wildstock) and Bank of India Bank Account no. 903220110000361 (held in the name of Wildstock) were mentioned wherein investors could deposit the fees payable in lieu of the investment advisory services availed which were being offered through this website. On the basis of KYC documents pertaining to these bank accounts, as received from the respective banks, it was found that out of these four accounts two were in the name of Wildstock and two were in the name of Mr. Sanjeev Singh. KYC documents further revealed that Wildstock was sole proprietory concern of Mr. Sanjeev Singh. Now, the Noticees are contending that the website was fake where their identities were misused. Assuming, the said contention of the Noticees is correct, it is beyond comprehension and Noticees have also not explained, why someone will create a webpage using identity of the Noticees for giving the investment advice and mention the bank accounts of the Noticees allowing the fees collected through his illegal act to be deposited into the bank accounts of the Noticees. If someone had created fake website using identities of the Noticees for giving investment advice, then he would have mentioned his own bank account number for reaping the benefits of his illegal act and not of the Noticees. Furthermore, it is observed in the interim order that the bank accounts of the Noticees had collected fees. From the State Bank of India account statement of the Noticees, I find that around Rs. 10,69,789.03/- have been credited during the period Final Order in the matter of M/s Wildstock (Proprietor: Mr. Sanjeev Singh)  Page 12 of 19  April 15, 2019 February 18, 2020, in the said Bank account. Similarly, from the Axis Bank account statement, I find that around Rs. 6,81,270.67/- have been credited during the period April 15, 2019 to February 04, 2020. Similarly, from the HDFC Bank account statement, I find that around Rs. 22,36,549/- has been credited from the period September 23, 2019 to February 04, 2020, in the said account and from the Bank of India account statement, I find that around Rs. 9,59,436.18/- has been credited from the period from August 23, 2019 to February 19, 2020, in the said account.  If the Noticees were not aware as to why these amounts were being credited in their bank accounts they should have raised this issue with Police or the Cyber Cell or the banks, which is not the case with Noticees. Therefore, this contention of the Noticees in the facts and circumstances of the case, is untenable.  It appears to be an afterthought in order to wriggle out of the consequences of these proceedings. Further contention of the Noticees is that the transactions mentioned in their bank accounts, as referred in the interim order do not tally with the actual transactions in their bank accounts, as the amounts are not matching. In this regard, firstly, I note that Noticees have not denied that the bank accounts referred to in the interim order do not belong to them. I note that transactions referred to in the interim order are on the basis of the bank account statements of the Noticees, as received from the respective banks. Therefore, entries in these statements are to be treated as prima facie evidence of such entry, in terms of Section 4 of the Bankers\\\\\\\\u2019 Books Evidence Act, 1891. Noticees have not produced any bank statement of these accounts, in support of their contention. Thus, Noticees are accepting that these bank accounts, which as per interim order, were used for depositing of fees by the investors in lieu of investment advice provided/to be provided by the Noticees, belonged to them but merely disputing transactions therein without any supporting evidence. Therefore, I find that contention of the Noticees in this regard is untenable.  8. I note that Noticees on their website i.e. www.wildstocks.in  represented that \\\\\\\\u201cwe continuously strive to empower the retail community by sharing knowledge, providing superior tools and great support, all at a minimal to zero cost. We have a team of highly skilled and intellectual staff, specialized in various segments, to help you in any kind.\\\\\\\\u201d From the KYC of account opening form of HDFC Bank Ltd., it is noted that the account is in the name of Wild stock and Mr. Sanjeev Singh is its sole proprietor. Noticees on their website also represented that: \\\\\\\\u201cWe have been handling Final Order in the matter of M/s Wildstock (Proprietor: Mr. Sanjeev Singh)  Page 13 of 19  finances and investments for a long time and the hefty experience makes our experts the best in the domain area of Investments and the subsequent Growth.\\\\\\\\u201d I note that following pricing details for availing various services were mentioned on the website of the Noticees:   Monthly Quarterly Yearly Intraday Cash 10,000   25,000 90,000 Stock Cash Premium 20,000   50,000 1,75,000 Stock Cash HNI 75,000  2,10,000 4,00,000 Stock Future 12,000   35,000 1,20,000 Stock Future Premium 25,000  70,000 2,50,000 Stock Future HNI 75,000  2,10,000 4,00,000 Stock Option Call & Put Basic 10,000   25,000 90,000 Stock Option Premium 20,000   50,000 1,80,000 Stock  Option HNI 50,000  1,30,000  (Half Yearly\\\\\\\\uf0e0 2,50,000)  4,00,000 Index Option 5,000   12,000 30,000 Commodity Bullion  10,000   27,000 90,000 Commodity Base Metal & Energy 10,000    25,000 50,000 Commodity Premium 30,000   80,000 2,80,000 Commodity HNI 1,00,000  2,65,000 5,00,000  9. From the aforesaid facts, I find that Wildstock which is proprietorship concern of Mr. Sanjeev Singh was engaged in giving advice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, through its website. I find that these services were being offered by the Noticees in lieu of the consideration which could be paid by the investor concerned in the State Bank of India Bank Account No. 31146241699 (held in the name of Sanjeev Singh) or Axis Bank Account No. 915010055728735 (held in the name of Sanjeev Singh) or  HDFC Bank Account no. 50200044312937 (held in the name of Wildstock) or Bank of India Bank Account no.   903220110000361 (held in the name of Wildstock) or through e-wallets , details of which were provided on the website under Payment Details Final Order in the matter of M/s Wildstock (Proprietor: Mr. Sanjeev Singh)  Page 14 of 19  Section. From the State Bank of India account statement of the Noticees, I find that around Rs. 10,69,789.03/- have been credited during the period April 15, 2019 February 18, 2020 , in the said Bank account. Similarly, from the Axis Bank account statement, I find that around Rs. 6,81,270.67/- have been credited during the period April 15, 2019 to February 04, 2020. Similarly, from the HDFC Bank account statement, I find that around Rs. 22,36,549/- has been credited from the period September 23, 2019 to February 04, 2020, in the said account and from the Bank of India account statement, I find that around Rs. 9,59,436.18/- has been credited from the period from August 23, 2019 to February 19, 2020, in the said account. In view of this, I find that Noticees were providing investment advice, in lieu of consideration. In terms of Regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations, 2013 such an advice is \\\\\\\\u201cinvestment advice\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Wildstock and its proprietor Mr. Sanjeev Singh were engaged in the business of providing investment advice to public, for consideration and were thus, acting as an investment adviser, as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations, 2013.   10. Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 provides as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  11. In order to protect the interest of investors and to maintain integrity of the securities market, IA Regulations, 2013 provides safeguards to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected. One such safeguard is that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to obtain registration from SEBI as required under Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013. Regulation 3(1) provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d Final Order in the matter of M/s Wildstock (Proprietor: Mr. Sanjeev Singh)  Page 15 of 19  and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of IA Regulations. Further, safeguards provided under IA Regulations, 2013 includes continued minimum professional qualification and net-worth requirement for investment adviser, disclosure of all conflict of interest, prohibition on entering into transactions which are contrary to advice given for 15 days, risk profiling of investors, maintaining documented process for selecting investment for client based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s objective and risk profile, understanding the nature and risks of products or assets selected for clients, etc.   12. The activities of the Noticees, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that the Noticees were holding themselves out and acting as an investment adviser. However, it is noted that the Noticees is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of Investment Advisor. Hence, I find that these activities/ representations as being made by the Noticees without holding the certificate of registration as investment adviser are in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013.  13. In my view, unregistered investment advisors like the Noticees in the present case can put investors at great risk by misleading them. In the present case, Noticees on their website, inter alia, mentioned that: \\\\\\\\u201cWe have been handling finances and investments for a long time and the hefty experience makes our experts the best in the domain area of Investments and the subsequent Growth.\\\\\\\\u201d The Noticees also claimed that: \\\\\\\\u201cWe at Wildstock also understand that each individual would have his own earning and investment patterns, which are primarily governed by the per-annual influx of money, and the liabilities that are targeted at the end of the maturity term. We offer individual plans to suit your needs and do not focus on one standardized investment plan\\\\\\\\u201d. As stated above, SEBI Act, 1992 and IA Regulations, 2013 requires any investment advisor to hold a certificate of registration to act as such. I find that Noticees were not holding any certificate of registration from SEBI to act as investment advisor. Thus, the claims/representations made by the Noticees on their website were misleading and were made to allure investors to avail investment advisory services being offered by the Noticees. The Noticees have knowingly misrepresented on the websites floated by them that they are experts in stock market analysis and are experienced in Final Order in the matter of M/s Wildstock (Proprietor: Mr. Sanjeev Singh)  Page 16 of 19  investment advisory.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter being referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI') conducted investigation into the initial public offer (\\\\\\\\u2018IPO\\\\\\\\u2019) of Birla Pacific Medspa Limited (hereinafter being referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018BPML/Company\\\\\\\\u2019), for the period from July 7, 2011 to July 15, 2011 (hereinafter being referred to as \"Investigation Period\"), since there was high volatility on the day of listing.

During the course of investigation, it was observed that BPML had received IPO proceeds amounting to Rs. 64.17 crores in its bank account (Yes Bank, Nariman Point Mumbai-A/c No. 4840000358384) on July 06, 2011. On analysis of the IPO proceed utilization and fund flow from BPML\\\\\\\\u2019s bank account,  it was observed in investigation that BPML had not invested the funds pending utilization as disclosed in the prospectus, but had transferred part of the funds to various other entities including Subhashree Hiris Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter being referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Subhashree /Noticee1\\\\\\\\u2019) and Skylight Distributors Pvt. Ltd.(hereinafter being referred to as  \\\\\\\\u2018Skylight/Noticee 2\\\\\\\\u2019) (both Noticee 1 and Noticee 2 are being collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019).  4. Based on the findings of the investigation, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings against the Noticees under Section 15HA of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter being referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2019 ), for the alleged violations of provisions of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter being referred to as \"PFUTP Regulations\") read with Section 12A(a), (b) & (c) of the SEBI Act by the Noticees.  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  5. Vide order dated December 08, 2016, Shri D. Sura Reddy was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018AO\\\\\\\\u2019) under Section 15-I of SEBI Act read  with  Rule  3 of  the SEBI  (Procedure  for  Holding  Inquiry  and  Imposing Penalties by  Adjudicating  Officer)  Rules,  1995  (hereinafter  being referred  to  as \"AO Rules\") to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions of Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, the aforesaid alleged violations by the Noticees. Subsequent to transfer of Shri D. Sura Reddy, Shri Jeevan Sonaparote was appointed as the AO in the said matter. Subsequent to transfer of Shri Jeevan Sonaparote, Shri B.J. Dilip was appointed as the AO in the matter. Thereafter, on account of transfer of Shri B.J. Dilip to another department, the undersigned was appointed as the AO in the matter by SEBI vide order dated December 29, 2020.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING  6. A Show Cause Notice dated April 20, 2017 (hereinafter being referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticees  under Rule 4(1) of the AO Rules to show-cause as to why an inquiry should not  be  initiated  against  them and penalty, if any, not be imposed on them under Adjudication Order in respect of Subshashree Hiris Pvt. Ltd. and SkyLight Distributors Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Birla Pacific Medspa Limited               Page 3 of 9  Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, for the alleged violations of the  provisions of Regulations  3(a),  (b),  (c),  (d)  and  4(1) of  PFUTP  Regulations read with Section 12A(a), (b) & (c) of the SEBI Act by the Noticees. The allegations levelled against the Noticees, as observed from the SCN, are given below:  a. During  the  investigation,  on analysis of  the  IPO  proceed  utilization  and  fund flow from BPML account, it was observed that BPML had not invested funds pending  utilizations  as  disclosed  in  prospectus.  As per the schedule  of implementation of BPML as mentioned in the prospectus,15, 15 and 25 Evolve Medspa centers would be completed during the Financial Years 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 respectively.  However, no such clinic was opened. Thus, it is alleged that BPML had failed to utilize the IPO proceeds as per the objects of the issue as stated in the prospectus and instead had diverted the IP. b. BPML received IPO proceeds of Rs. 64,17,63,660 (Rs. 64.17 crores) in its bank account on July 06, 2011. From these IPO funds, on July 6, 2011, funds amounting Rs. 2,00,00,000/- were transferred to the Noticees collectively (Rs. 1 crore to Noticee 1 and Rs.1 crore to Noticee 2) by BPML.  c. It is further alleged that Noticee 1 and Noticee 2, who were involved in the IPO fund flow, were related to each other through common directorship. It was observed that the Noticees were West Bengal based, away from Mumbai BPML head office and were not into business of interior or medical equipment\\\\\\\\u2019s procurement or supply.  d. Thus,   it  is  alleged  that  all  these  financial  transactions, shown  by  BPML  as being advances for the purpose of fulfilling issue objects, were fraudulent in nature and some of them were also used to fund purchase of shares of BPML and support price of the shares on the listing day. e. In view of the above, it is alleged that Noticee 1 and Noticee 2 have aided and abetted in the diversion of proceeds of IPO by BPML and have therefore, violated the provisions of Regulations 3(a),(b),(c),(d) and 4(1) of the PFUTP Regulations read with Section 12A(a),(b)and (c) of the SEBI Act.    7. I note from the records that the SCN dated April 20, 2017 issued to the Noticees returned undelivered. Thereafter, a newspaper publication was made in terms of AO Rules wherein the Noticees were advised to submit their replies on or before February 05, 2019 and to attend the hearing before the erstwhile AO on February 12, 2019. However, the Noticees did not appear for the hearing and did not seek any further date of hearing. Vide email dated November 04, 2020, another opportunity of hearing was granted to Noticees on November 19, 2020 before the erstwhile AO, which also was not attended by the Noticees. Adjudication Order in respect of Subshashree Hiris Pvt. Ltd. and SkyLight Distributors Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Birla Pacific Medspa Limited               Page 4 of 9   8. Subsequent to appointment of undersigned as AO, in the interest of natural justice, hearing notice dated March 18, 2021 was sent to the Noticees through digitally signed email/ SPAD/Affixture granting an opportunity of personal hearing before the undersigned on March 30, 2021. From the material available on record, I note that the hearing notice sent through digitally signed email has not bounced back and was duly served on the Noticees.  The said hearing notice  was also affixed  at  the  last  known addresses of the Noticees and further, a newspaper publication was also in made in Times of India, Rajasthan Patrika  and Eisammay on  March  27,  2021 for granting opportunity of personal hearing in terms of AO Rules. The Noticees again failed to avail of the opportunity of personal hearing.  9. I note that sufficient opportunities have been granted to the Noticees to submit their replies to the SCN and to appear for personal hearing. However, despite service  of  the  SCN  and  hearing  notices,  none  of  the  given  opportunities  were availed of by the Noticees. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Classic Credit Ltd. v. SEBI [2007] 76 SCL 51 (SAT -MUM) has, inter alia, held that \\\\\\\\u201cthe appellants did not file any reply to the second show-cause notice. This being so, it has to be presumed that the charges alleged against them in the show-cause notice were admitted by them\\\\\\\\u201d. Similarly, the Hon'ble SAT, in the case of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Ors.  v. SEBI (in appeal No.  68/2013)  decided  on  February  11, 2014, also held that \\\\\\\\u201c...appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them  nor  availed  opportunity  of  personal  hearing  offered  to  them  in  the adjudication  proceedings  and,  therefore,  appellants  are  presumed  to have admitted charges levelled against them in the show cause notices\\\\\\\\u201d.   10. In view of the above, I am compelled to proceed ex parte in the matter against the Noticees. I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been complied with since sufficient opportunities have been provided to the Noticee to submit their replies and to appear for personal hearing. I, therefore, am of the view that the Noticees have nothing to submit and in terms of rule 4(7) of the AO Rules, the matter can be proceeded ex-parte on the basis of material available on record. Therefore, the present proceedings against the Noticee are undertaken ex-parte on the basis of available documents and information.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES  11. I have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticees and the documents / material available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are: Adjudication Order in respect of Subshashree Hiris Pvt. Ltd. and SkyLight Distributors Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Birla Pacific Medspa Limited               Page 5 of 9  (a) Whether the Noticees have violated Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1) of the PFUTP Regulations read with Section 12A(a), (b) & (c) of the SEBI Act? (b) If yes, then do the violations on the part of the Noticees attract any monetary penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act? (c) If yes, then what would be quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticees, taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5(2) of the Rules?  12. Before I proceed with the matter, it is pertinent to mention the relevant legal provisions alleged to have been violated by the Noticees and the same are reproduced below:   I. PFUTP Regulations:  3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities:  No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under; c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.  4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices: 1. Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities. Adjudication Order in respect of Subshashree Hiris Pvt. Ltd. and SkyLight Distributors Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Birla Pacific Medspa Limited               Page 6 of 9  II. SEBI Act  Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control.  12A. No person shall directly or indirectly \\\\\\\\u2014 (a) Use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; (b) Employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; (c) Engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  13. The first issue to be decided is whether the Noticees have violated Regulations 3(a), (b),(c),(d) and 4(1) of the PFUTP Regulations read with Section 12A(a), (b) ,(c) of the SEBI Act.  14. I note that the objects of the IPO, as disclosed in the prospectus,  was to meet the capital expenditure towards establishing 55 outlets of Evolve Medspa across various cities and places,  to  meet the working capital requirements for running the above centres, to meet expenses towards brand promotion etc. I also note that BPML had received IPO proceeds of Rs. 64.17 crores in its bank account on July 06, 2011.   15. From the records, I note that out of the IPO proceeds of Rs. 64.17 crores, Rs. 2 crores  had been diverted to the Noticees on July 06, 2011 i.e. prior to date of listing and this money was not returned to the company i.e.  BPML. From the material available on record, I note that the Noticees were West Bengal based and not into business of interior or medical equipment\\\\\\\\u2019s procurement or supply. I also note that Noticee 1 and Noticee 2 are both connected to each other through the same set of directors. Adjudication Order in respect of Subshashree Hiris Pvt. Ltd. and SkyLight Distributors Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Birla Pacific Medspa Limited               Page 7 of 9  16. Therefore, I find that an amount of of Rs. 2 crore out of IPO proceeds, has been diverted to the Noticees and  has neither been utilized for the stated object of IPO nor been returned to the company. Further, I find from the records that BPML has not provided any evidence related to these financial transactions. Therefore, it is clear that instead of being utilized for the stated purpose, as disclosed in the prospectus, the money out of the IPO proceeds have been fraudulently diverted to the Noticees who have aided and abetted BPML in diversion of these proceeds of the IPO.   17. In view of the aforesaid, I find that the violation of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1) of the PFUTP Regulations read with Section 12A(a), (b) & (c) of the SEBI Act by the Noticees stands established.  18. The next issue for consideration is whether the violations on the part of the Noticees would attract any monetary penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act? And if yes, then what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticees, taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5(2) of the AO Rules?  19. In context of the above, I refer to the observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of Chairman, SEBI vs. Shriram Mutual Fund {[2006] 5 SCC 361} wherein the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Court had observed: \\\\\\\\u201cIn our considered opinion, penalty is attracted as soon as the contravention of the statutory obligation as contemplated by the Act and the Regulations is established and hence the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes wholly irrelevant A breach of civil obligation which  attracts  penalty  in  the  nature  of  fine  under  the  provisions  of  the  Act  and  the Regulations would immediately attract the levy of penalty irrespective of the fact whether contravention must made by the defaulter with guilty intention or not.\\\\\\\\u2019\\\\\\\\u2019  20. Therefore, the aforesaid violations committed by the Noticees would attract monetary penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act which reads as follows:  SEBI Act Section 15HA Penalty for fraudulent and unfair trade practices.  \\\\\\\\u201c If any person indulges In fraudulent and unfair trade practices relating to securities, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than five Adjudication Order in respect of Subshashree Hiris Pvt. Ltd. and SkyLight Distributors Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Birla Pacific Medspa Limited               Page 8 of 9  lakh rupees but which may extend to twenty-five crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such practices, whichever is higher.\"  21. While determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, it is important to consider the factors relevantly as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under:-  Section 15J - Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer while adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:- (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  22. I find that on the basis of data available on record, the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage enjoyed by the Noticees and the consequent losses suffered by the investors cannot be quantified exactly. Further the amount of loss to an investor or group of investors also cannot be quantified on the basis of available facts and data. Even though the monetary loss to the investors cannot be computed, any manipulation in the volume or price of the stocks caused by vested interests always erodes investor confidence.   In the instant matter, by agreeing to participate in illegal routing of IPO funds of BPML through deceptive and fraudulent transactions, the Noticees have facilitated BPML to divert IPO money for purposes other than stated in the prospectus and thereby defrauded investors who have invested in the IPO of BPML. On account of the seriousness of the offence committed by the Noticees, I am inclined to impose an appropriate penalty which would also serve as a deterrent.    ORDER  23. Having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, the material available on record and the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act, as enumerated above, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act r/w Rule 5 of the AO Rules, hereby impose a monetary penalty of Rs. 5,00,000/- (Rupees Five lakh only) each on Noticee 1 and Noticee 2, i.e., Subhashree Hiris Pvt. Ltd. and SkyLight Distributors Pvt. Ltd. Adjudication Order in respect of Subshashree Hiris Pvt. Ltd. and SkyLight Distributors Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Birla Pacific Medspa Limited               Page 9 of 9   24. I am of the view that the said penalty is commensurate with the lapse/omission on the part of the Noticees. The Noticees shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order, either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \"SEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\", payable at Mumbai OR by using the web link https://siportal.sebi.gov.in/intermediary/AOPaymentGateway.html.  25. The Noticees shall forward said Demand Draft to the Enforcement Department - Division of Regulatory Action- IV of SEBI. The Noticee shall provide the following details while forwarding the Demand Draft: a. Name and PAN of the entity (Noticee)  b. Name of the case / matter c. Purpose of Payment - Payment of penalty under AO proceedings d. Bank Name and Account Number e. Transaction Number  26. In the event of failure to pay the said amount of penalty by the Noticees within 45 days of the receipt of this Order, recovery proceedings may be initiated against them under Section 28A of the SEBI Act for realization of the said amount of penalty along with interest thereon, inter alia, by attachment and sale of their movable and immovable properties.  27. Copies of this Adjudication Order are being sent to the Noticees and also to SEBI in terms of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules.

Page 2 of 36  Background: 1. The present proceedings arise out of an investigation conducted in the scrip of Shantanu Sheorey Aquakult Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSSAL/the Company\\\\\\\\u201d) for the period of March 01, 2014 to May 31, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe investigation period\\\\\\\\u201d), in which a common show cause notice dated August 09, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe SCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to 21 entities named above. The facts necessary for the present proceedings, as have been captured in the said SCN are briefly stated hereunder:  i. The scrip of the Company was listed on BSE Limited. The price of the scrip opened at INR 4.95 on March 03, 2014, which touched a high of INR 261 on May 26, 2016 before closing at INR 260.50 on May 31, 2016.  ii. The Company had made preferential allotment of its equity shares on three different instances during the Financial Years 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15. The Company had made profits of INR 26.40 Lakh, INR 79.80 Lakh and INR 99.20 Lakh for the FY 2012-13, 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively and incurred a loss of INR 8.52 Crore for the FY 2013-14. During the investigation period, no major corporate announcements except for declaration of financial results, allotment of shares on preferential allotment etc., were made by the Company.  iii. The trading in the scrip of the Company was under suspension during the period of January 07, 2015 to December 08, 2015, due to surveillance measure. The market capital of the Company as on March 23, 2017 was INR 559.13 Crore.  iv. As the profits of the Company were negligible and no major corporate announcements were made, the price hike of the scrip from INR 4.95 to INR 260.50 during the investigation period did not view to be normal.  v. A total no. of 8274 trades were executed in the scrip of the Company during the investigation period involving 79,55,079 shares i.e. 961 shares per trade on an average.   vi. The Noticees were found to be involved in the trades which had contributed to the last traded price (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cLTP\\\\\\\\u201d) and were also found to be connected to each other, majorly on account of common directorships, fund transfer etc.  vii. The Noticees had carried out a total number of 4217 buy trades in the scrip of the Company out of the total number of 8274 trades, as aforesaid, which was 50.96% of the total market wide trade. Out of those 4217 trades, in 4028 trades, the buy orders were placed by the Noticees subsequent to the sell orders, with which the buy orders of the Noticees have got matched.   Order in the matter of Shantanu Sheorey Aquakult Ltd. Page 3 of 36  The said 4028 trades were executed by the Noticees during the period of February 01, 2016 to May 31, 2016 and during such time, the price of the scrip of the Company had increased from INR 141 to INR 260.50. In the aforestated period, the Noticees in total had purchased 44.07 Lakh shares, which was 55.39% of the total market volume of 79.55 Lakh shares.  viii. Further, out of these 4028 trades, in 1252 trades, the Noticees had placed their respective buy orders at prices higher than the sell order prices available on the market platform. In the said 1252 trades, the Noticees have purchased a total quantity of 36.38 Lakh shares only, when the total quantity of shares available for sale from the sellers was 98.98 Lakh shares.  2. Based on the aforesaid facts, the SCN alleges that by executing such trades at prices higher than the LTP, the Noticees have violated Regulation 3 (a), (b), (c), (d), 4 (1), 4 (2) (a) and (e) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe PFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) 3. From the records of the present matter, it is noted that as the SCN could not be served on all the Noticees through SPAD/email, therefore, the service of the SCN was effected upon few of the Noticees by way of substituted mode, with the following details:  Table no. 1 Sr. no.

The hearing notice for the said date of hearing was served upon Noticee nos. 5, 6, 12 and 20. As the hearing notices could not be served upon the rest of the Noticees through postal modes, the said hearing notice was affixed on the last known address of the Noticee no. 11 while on the other Noticees, the   Order in the matter of Shantanu Sheorey Aquakult Ltd.

Subsequently another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to all the Noticees on April 22, 2020. However, due to the lockdown imposed in the wake of Covid-19, the personal hearing on the said date could not take place. The hearing was thereafter scheduled on August 25, 2020 and hearing notices dated July 27, 2020 were issued to all the Noticees through postal modes as well as through emails (as mentioned in the records of BSE and CDSL).

As noted from the above details, certain Noticees had requested SEBI for serving the copy of the SCN at their new addresses. Accordingly, the SCN along with the annexures were again sent at the new addresses provided by the respective entities, however, as the said letters also returned undelivered, the copy of the SCN and the annexures were served on the respective entities through emails. Subsequently, pursuant to the issuance of the hearing notices (through publication), certain entities like Noticee no. 3 again requested for the copy of the SCN and in response thereto, in the interest of justice, copy of the SCN and its annexures were provided afresh to the such entities to enable them to defend themselves against the allegations made in the SCN. It is also pertinent to mention here that the Noticee nos. 1 and 13 (vide their separate emails dated August 17, 2020) had submitted that they have filed an application under SEBI (Settlement Proceedings) Regulations, 2018, however, no detail of any such application was provided by the said Noticees.  10. As noted earlier, only Noticee nos. 5, 6, 8, 11, 16, 17 and 21 have filed written replies to the SCN. A careful perusal of the said replies reflect that all these replies carry certain common submissions, which are presented in brief herein below:  i. The SCN has been issued after delay as the alleged transactions pertained to May, 2016 and SCN has been issued in August, 2017.   Order in the matter of Shantanu Sheorey Aquakult Ltd. Page 9 of 36  ii. The scrip was trading in \\\\\\\\u201cT\\\\\\\\u201d group, therefore there was no scope of manipulation due to the continuous surveillance.  iii. The SCN does not allege any profit earned by the Noticees nor it demonstrates how the Noticees gained by causing LTP contribution. No loss to any investor has been caused.  iv. The trading system does not provide the details of orders placed by sellers, like quantity of shares, price and time of orders etc.  v. The power under Section 11B of SEBI Act, 1992 cannot be used for penal purposes, as has been laid down by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Libord Securities Vs. SEBI and by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of SEBI Vs. Libord Securities.  vi. The Noticees are net buyers of the scrip during the investigation period.  vii. The Noticee nos. 5 and 6 have traded only during February, 2016 to May, 2016 whereas the Noticee no. 8 had traded during March, 2014 to May 2016.   viii. The trades of the respective Noticees have been wrongly bunched with other Noticees.  ix. Mr. Kumar Raichand Madan (based on whose statement recorded before Income Tax, the allegations of connections have been made in the SCN), has expired on 08.10.2016. x. The bank account transactions referred to in the SCN to impute connections are commercial in nature and have no connection with the trading done in the scrip of the Company.  xi. The entities with whom connection is sought to be alleged are not the counter parties to the trades of the Noticees.  xii. Orders were executed at sell order prices.  xiii. There is no embargo on placing of orders on positive LTP and manipulation cannot be related only to positive LTP as it can be a genuine case of buyer being desperate to acquire shares.  xiv. It is a market practice to put orders at higher round figure price to get the orders executed.  xv. All the orders were limit order which can only be executed at limit price or lower, based on the price quoted by the seller.  xvi. There is a substantial time gap in the orders placed by the Noticees as buyers and majority of the pending sell orders.  xvii. The counter parties are not impleaded nor such parties are connected to the Noticee.   11. It is further noted that apart from the aforesaid common points of arguments, following submissions have also been made, which though vary only on the factual aspects specific to a particular Noticee are identical in essence, such as:   Order in the matter of Shantanu Sheorey Aquakult Ltd. Page 10 of 36  i. The current Directors of Noticee no. 5 are Mr. Sanjay Mahadev Unawane and Sujata Deepak Mane. The current Directors of Noticee no. 6 are Mr. Akshay Vijay Nawale and Sunil Sudhakar Ahire. The current Directors of Noticee no. 8 are Nisha Sanjay Unawane and Akshay Unawane. The current Directors of Noticee no. 11 are Mr. Rohit Dattatrya Navle and Mr. Ganesh Shankar Budbadkar. The current Directors of Noticee no. 16 are Mr. Rohit Dattatrya Navle and Mr. Aditya Rupchand Sueyavanshi. The current Directors of the Noticee no. 17 are Mr. Ranjankumar Ramdulare Rajbhar and Mr. Prakash Ratilal Naik. The current Directors of the Noticee no. 21 are Ms. Reshma Rajesh Malagavakar and Mr. Ajitkumar Sudhakar Singh.  ii. During the relevant period the price of the scrip rose from INR 150.80 to INR 260.50. The Notice no. 5 made an insignificant contribution of INR 2.60 (1.02% of the total market positive LTP) towards LTP while the Notice no. 6 contributed INR 14.30 (4.84% of the total market positive LTP) to the LTP and the said LTP contributions are miniscule to the total market positive LTP.  iii. During the investigation period, Noticee no. 5 purchased 2,20,880 shares and sold 10,320 shares. Noticee no. 6 had purchased 8,12,243 shares and Noticee no. 8 had purchased 2,96,000 shares and both of them did not sell any share. Noticee no. 11 has purchased 159497 shares and no shares were sold by it. The Noticee no. 16 has purchased 24367 shares and sold 1900 shares and the Noticee no. 17 has purchased 2,97,504 shares and sold 19,458 shares. The Noticee no. 21 has purchased 327385 shares during the investigation period.  iv. As per SCN, the Noticee no. 5 had executed 166 trades, out of which 129 trades resulted in 0 LTP, 14 trades resulted in negative LTP of Rs. 6.00 and only 23 trades resulted in positive LTP of Rs. 12.90. Noticee no. 6 had executed 489 trades, out of which 403 trades resulted in 0 LTP, 21 trades resulted in negative LTP of Rs. 7.20 and only 65 trades resulted in positive LTP of Rs. 29. The Noticee no. 11 has executed 202 trades, out of which 165 trades have resulted in 0 LTP, 17 trades have resulted into negative LTP of Rs.4.70 and 20 trades have resulted into positive LTP of Rs.6.20. The Noticee no. 16 has alleged to have executed 2 trades in a single day when it contributed LTP of Rs.2.70 only. The Noticee no. 17 has executed 263 trades, out of which 232 trades have resulted into 0 LTP, 11 trades have resulted into negative LTP of Rs.1.80 and 20 trades have resulted into positive LTP of Rs.17.10. The Noticee no. 21 has executed 261 trades, out of which 218 trades have resulted in 0 LTP, 13 trades have resulted into negative LTP of Rs.3.80 and 30 trades have resulted in positive LTP of Rs.10.90. The aforesaid pattern of trade shows that the Noticees were not   Order in the matter of Shantanu Sheorey Aquakult Ltd. Page 11 of 36  having any intention of manipulating the scrip as every trade will result into some kind of LTP.  v. On a few occasions, part of the order quantity got matched at 0 LTP and subsequently, for remaining quantities, the price was modified which led to contribution to LTP. The modification was done to grab the next best-selling orders. For example, an order of 1000 shares @ INR 227 per share was placed by the Noticee no. 5 for which, two trades of 400 and 250 shares got executed @ INR 227 only and no LTP was contributed. For remaining 350 shares, the price was modified @ INR 228 and resultantly, the trade got executed @ INR 227.50 by creating a positive LTP of INR 0.50.  Consideration   12. After carefully perusing the charges levelled in the SCN, the replies that have been filed, as well as the materials available on record, I observe that the issue that needs to be adjudged in the present proceedings is whether or not, the trades executed by the Noticees in the scrip of the Company, have resulted in violation of provisions of the PFUTP Regulations? 13. Form the replies filed by the Noticees, as aforesaid, I find that two technical issues have been raised by most of the Noticees. The first one pertains to the non-supply of the copy of the entire investigation report and the second issue pertains to the delay in initiating the proceedings, which is submitted to have caused prejudice to the Noticees. Therefore, before embarking on the merits of the matter, I find it appropriate to first deal with those two preliminary issues.   14. Insofar as the issue of providing copy of documents like investigation report is concerned, there is no dispute that the relevant findings of the investigation report which formed the basis for the imputations/allegations made against the Noticees have already been captured in the show cause notice, which was duly served upon the Noticees. Further, I observe that all the relevant documents which have been relied upon for the purpose of examination to arrive at the findings against the Noticees, including the bank account statements, complete or /relevant Order Log and Trade Log, have already been served on the Noticees in form of Annexures to the SCN. Since all the relevant extracts of the investigation report have been captured in the SCN and the documents relied upon therein have also been provided to the Noticees, there does not appear to be any prejudice whatsoever caused to the Noticees nor the Noticees have brought to my attention any such specific prejudice that has possibly been caused to them by not receiving any particular document due to which they can claim that they are not in a position to defend themselves against the allegations made in the SCN. The Noticees have apparently raised the bogey of non-   Order in the matter of Shantanu Sheorey Aquakult Ltd. Page 12 of 36  receipt of investigation report or documents as a matter of a general claim without any bonafide reason or specific grievance in this regard, which appears to be an attempt to thwart the proceedings. I may add here that Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in a recent order dated July 17, 2020, passed in the matter of Anant R. Sathe Vs. SEBI (Appeal no. 150/2020) have held that SEBI is required to supply only those documents, which have been relied upon while serving the show cause notice and supply of such documents are sufficient for the purpose of filing an efficacious reply in defence. Thus, I can firmly observe that there is no violation of principles of natural justice as all the documents relied upon in the present proceedings have already been served to the Noticees along with the SCN.  15. With respect to the submission that delay in initiating the present proceedings has caused prejudice to the Noticees, I find it relevant to recollect here that the investigation period in the present matter was for the period of March 01, 2014 to May 31, 2016, and the SCN came to be issued on August 09, 2017. Further, the details of time consumed in serving the SCN as well as hearing notices on most of the Noticees have already been elaborated in the earlier part of the order and thus need no reiteration. Therefore, from the factual conspectus of the present case, it is seen that the SCN was issued within a period of around fifteen months from the end of the investigation period during which the alleged violations took place; hence, there does not appear to be any \\\\\\\\u2018delay\\\\\\\\u2019 which can be claimed to be fatal to have caused any serious prejudice of any nature to the Noticees and thereby incapacitated them from defending themselves against the allegations. It is an undisputed position that in order to arrive at a prima facie case prior to issuance of SCN, several factual details like bank account transfers, directorship, trading data, etc., need to be collected and investigated empirically, which was also done in the present case. Therefore, the reasonable time consumed to put appropriate efforts during an investigation, cannot be taken as a plank of defence by the delinquent itself, who was the subject of such investigation. I would also like to add here that the said claim of prejudice caused due to delay is also a generic claim, without assigning any details or explaining as to what exact prejudice was caused to the Noticees emanating from the purported delay. In this connection, it is noted that Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, while dealing with the issue of delay, have observed in the matter of Bhavesh Pabari Vs. SEBI (date of decision: October 07, 2020) as: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026The defense of delay is an afterthought and without any supporting reason like the prejudice in defending the case before the adjudicating officer\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d 16. It is also relevant to observe here that under the extant framework of SEBI Act, 1992 and PFUTP Regulations, there is no limitation period prescribed for initiation of action against any delinquent for the violations of the said Act and Regulations made thereunder. It is a settled position of law that in absence of any specific limitation period prescribed under the statute itself, the proceedings cannot be dropped merely on the ground of delay, and all the cases need   Order in the matter of Shantanu Sheorey Aquakult Ltd. Page 13 of 36  to be evaluated on the basis of their respective facts. [Ravi Mohan Vs. SEBI, date of decision: December 16, 2015]. It is also pertinent to note here that the ratio laid down by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the aforesaid case, was upheld and reiterated by it, in its order in the matter of Kunal Pradip Savla & Ors v. SEBI, date of decision: April 13, 2018. Thus, considering the foregoing, particularly the fact that the SCN has been issued within a reasonable time frame and in light of the applicable legal framework, I find that there is no merit in the said submission of the Noticees and accordingly the same is rejected.  17. Before adverting to the facts of the case, it is deemed relevant to first recapitulate that the SCN alleges violation of Regulation 3, (a), (b), (c), (d), 4 (1), 4 (2) (a) & (e) of PFUTP Regulations. Therefore, in order to adjudge the charges made against the Noticees and to evaluate the strength of the replies filed herein, it is relevant that a reference to the aforesaid regulations be made at this point, which are reproduced for ready reference hereunder:     Regulation 3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities  \\\\\\\\u201cNo person shall directly or indirectly \\\\\\\\u2013 (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in the securities in a fraudulent manner;  (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under;  (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange;  (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.\\\\\\\\u201d  Regulation 4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices  \\\\\\\\u201c(1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities.  (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following, namely: \\\\\\\\u2014  (a) indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market; \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026 (e) any act or omission amounting to manipulation of the price of a security;\\\\\\\\u201d   Order in the matter of Shantanu Sheorey Aquakult Ltd. Page 14 of 36  18. As noted in the earlier part of the order, certain trading activities of the Noticees, in the scrip of the Company have been alleged to be manipulative and unfair. Further, the said allegations are also corroborated by the inter-se connection between the Noticees. The allegation of connection is primarily premised on various cardinal factors such as common directorship, common email address, and in few cases, the said allegation is also premised on inter se fund transactions. The details of the connections that were observed to be existing amongst various Noticees during the relevant period, as culled out from the SCN are reproduced herein below:  Table no. 4 Sr. no.

In view of the prima facie finding in the interim order that Mr. Shailendra Sen, through his partnership firm Cash Cow, had already indulged in unregistered investment advisory activities, it was observed that he has prima facie knowingly made false statement/declaration in the application form for registration as IA by stating that he was not engaged in any investment advisory services prior to making such application and accordingly did not disclose his association as a partner in Cash Cow.  d. During the examination, it was also observed from the website of the Capital Heed that the Noticee is claiming to offer Portfolio Management Services (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPMS\\\\\\\\u201d) and also claims to have over a decade long experience in providing PMS whereas the Noticee is registered with SEBI only in the capacity of an investment adviser. Therefore, it has been alleged that the Noticee is prima facie misrepresenting to prospective investors that it can provide PMS for which it does not hold the certificate of registration from SEBI to carry the activity of PMS.  3. It is pertinent to note that the extant interim order primarily deals with Mr. Shailendra Sen (who was also a partner in Cash Cow) and his proprietorship i.e., Capital Heed which is registered with SEBI as an investment adviser. I notice that the matter against Cash Cow is being dealt with in a separate proceeding before another quasi-judicial authority in SEBI.   4. Based on the aforesaid prima facie findings in the interim order, as the Noticee was apparently  found to be in violations of the provisions of regulation 13, Clauses 1 and 8 of the Code of Conduct as specified in Third Schedule read with regulation 15 (9) of the IA Regulations and regulation 3 of the SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in respect of M/s Capital Heed Financial Research (Proprietor Mr. Shailendra Sen)    Page 3 of 21                       \\\\\\\\u201cPMS Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), the interim order referred to above was issued against the Noticee with the following directions in order to protect the interest of investors of securities market: a. The Noticee, and any person while working under him or under his instructions as employee or otherwise, shall cease and desist from soliciting/ acquiring any fresh clients for investment advisory services, directly or indirectly, till further orders. b. The Noticee, and any other person while working under him or under his instructions as employee or otherwise, shall cease and desist from offering any new investment advisory services to its existing clients for which fresh payment is required to be made by these clients. It is clarified that the services for which the existing clients have already made payment to the Noticee shall be duly delivered to these clients and no renewal of these services shall be permitted. c. The Noticee, and his representatives, as defined in Regulation 2(1)(r) of the SEBI (Investment Adviser) Regulations, 2013, shall discharge all their obligations, as required under these Regulations, towards the existing clients in respect of the investment advisory services that it has to deliver as mentioned in para 27 (b) above. d. The Noticee shall remove all references regarding his holding out as a portfolio manager made by him through any media (physical or digital). e. The Noticee shall circulate a copy of this Order to all its existing clients and display the contents of the same on its website immediately. 5. The interim order was passed ex-parte in the facts of the matter asking the Noticee to file his objections, and also to indicate if it needs an opportunity of personal hearing before SEBI.  6. Vide letter dated December 5, 2019 the Noticee made certain submissions in his defense and also requested for an opportunity of personal hearing. In compliance with the Principles of Natural Justice, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on October 14, 2020, wherein the Noticee appeared in person for personal hearing conducted through Video Conferencing and made oral submissions on the lines of its earlier reply filed in the matter. During the course of hearing, the Noticee admitted the fact that investment advisory services were being provided through Cash Cow. He further stated that the marketing of PMS was done inadvertently on the website of Capital Heed for the purpose of attracting more clients for investment advisory services, however, no such services pertaining to PMS were ever provided to any client in pursuance of the said assertion.  7. During the course of hearing, certain queries pertaining to the credit entries of funds received in the accounts of Cash Cow as mentioned in the interim order, were sought from the Noticee.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in respect of M/s Capital Heed Financial Research (Proprietor Mr. Shailendra Sen)    Page 4 of 21                       He was also asked to furnish explanation as to why the details of his past indulgence as IA in Cash Cow was not disclosed and was concealed while applying for registration of Capital Heed as an investment adviser. Accordingly, the Noticee was advised to submit his response on the aforesaid queries including confirmation of his admission made during the personal hearing that investment advisory services were indeed provided by him through Cash Cow. In response to the said queries, the Noticee through its letter dated October 29, 2020 has filed its response and has submitted its post hearing submissions as well.  8. The arguments advanced by the Noticee through its written as well as oral submissions are summarized herein below:    8.1 Pursuant to receipt of the interim order, necessary compliances have been made forthwith both in letter and in spirit.  8.2 The prima facie observations in respect of Cash Cow should not be interpolated to prejudice his certificate of registration as an investment adviser under Capital Heed. The facts and circumstances of both Cash Cow and Capital Heed are different and the Noticee has always cooperated with SEBI as regards their enquiry against Cash Cow. 8.3 The observations and findings made in respect to Cash Cow in the interim order has no bearing on the issue of IA registration certificate acquired by him/Capital Heed and only issue that needs to be looked into is whether Cash Cow was in existence and that it continued operation as on September 11, 2017 when the said IA \\\\\\\\u2018Form-A\\\\\\\\u2019 was filed by him and whether he was under an obligation to disclose that he was a partner in Cash Cow in the said form. 8.4 By way of Partnership Deed dated September 5, 2012 a partnership firm in the name and style of Cash Cow came to be constituted initially comprising two partners. The third partner joined on October 15, 2014.  8.5 The Noticee was never in active management and was not in the know of the actual affairs of the partnership. Further, all the partners including the Noticee were young individuals operating from Indore in Madhya Pradesh and were unaware of the recent legal and regulatory changes as regards the investment advisory business.  8.6 At the time of filling the application dated September 11, 2017 under \\\\\\\\u2018Form-A\\\\\\\\u2019 for grant of certificate of registration as an investment adviser, both of his statements that he was not engaged in investment advisory services prior to the same and he was not a partner in Cash Cow were true to the best of his knowledge for the following reasons: a. The partnership firm namely Cash Cow had become defunct sometime in February 2017. By a deed of dissolution of partnership dated March 29, 2017, the said__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in respect of M/s Capital Heed Financial Research (Proprietor Mr. Shailendra Sen)    Page 5 of 21                       Partnership was formally dissolved. After a period of 6 months, he applied for registration as an Investment Adviser on September 11, 2017 and that point in time, he was neither a partner of Cash Cow nor any such entity was existing on the said date. b. Cash Cow was registered and acting as an Authorized Person (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAP\\\\\\\\u201d) of Angel Broking Pvt. Ltd. and was not engaged in investment advisory services. All the complaints and prima facie case of SEBI as regards the Noticee acting as a partner of Cash Cow providing investment advisory services are prima facie observations and sub-judice for adjudication. c. Assuming but without admitting that Cash Cow was engaged in investment advisory services, the services were being provided under a genuine and bona-fide belief that the said business was well within the scope of work of an AP of a sub-broker and that Cash Cow was not required to obtain any separate registration as investment adviser and that they were not in violation of any SEBI Regulations. d. As soon as it has been pointed out that the business of Cash Cow was being carried out without a mandatory IA registration and/or License, the Noticee soon realized that the said business did not constitute as a lawful investment advisory business. Hence, the question of disclosure of him as a partner of Cash Cow being in investment advisory did not arise. 8.7 All the activities of Capital Heed are of pure investment advisory nature and there is nothing in the interim order to suggest that he has carried out any PMS and all the inadvertent references to the same on the website have already been removed.   8.8 The interim order has wrongly mentioned that Cash Cow carried out operations till October 2017 and the transactions details reproduced in the interim order are incorrect.    8.9 Since registration of Capital Heed as an IA was w.e.f December 29, 2017 all the activities are being carried out in a bonafide and honest manner and in strict compliance of IA Regulations and other relevant/applicable SEBI laws. 8.10 The para-wise reply to the interim order is as under: a. Contents of paras 1-2 and 14-15 of the interim order are a matter of record and the Noticee has no comments to offer as such. b. Further, the contents of paras 4 to 13 of the interim order are prima facie observations pertaining to affairs of Cash Cow and the Noticee has already provided his explanation on the same to the extent it is relevant to the present proceedings.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in respect of M/s Capital Heed Financial Research (Proprietor Mr. Shailendra Sen)    Page 6 of 21                       c. In response to the contents of paras 16 and 21, it is submitted that the Noticee has abided by all the conditions of IA certificate and whatever stated by him in the said \\\\\\\\u2018Form-A\\\\\\\\u2019 was true and correct to the best of his knowledge and that if at all, there has been any inadvertent mis-statement, the same is an unintentional error on his part which he may be allowed to rectify. Further, there are absolutely no observation which is detrimental to the integrity of the capital markets, as no statement was made or information concealed knowingly with any malafide intent while obtaining the IA registration. The bona fide are reflected from the fact that the Noticee was the only partner of Cash Cow who has responded to the SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s inquiry. Further, all the references of PMS have been removed and also the interim order has been displayed on its website.  d. With regard to paras 22 and 23 of the interim order, it is submitted that the Capital Heed has not been involved in transactions pertaining to PMS and the same may be verified by SEBI in the open market or from the clients of the Capital Heed. e. The Noticee is willing to co-operate as regards any detailed examination. The unintentional bona-fide error on his part in one caption of the \\\\\\\\u2018Form A\\\\\\\\u2019 is a solitary error, technical in nature and does not warrant an exercise of SEBI powers to pass interim order which in effect is virtually destroying the business especially when for the last two years of the operation as an IA, no complaints of any wrongdoings which in any way have affected the safety or integrity of the securities market has been received.  8.11 The account number- 915020050222831 of Axis Bank mentioned in the interim order is incorrect as this account number does not belong to Cash Cow or any of the partners. Also, the transaction period of the aforesaid bank account is incorrect as Cash Cow had stopped all the work by February 27, 2017 and not received credits thereafter, as has been orally submitted in this regard. Further, none of the partners of Cash Cow has received any amount on behalf of Cash Cow to their personal bank accounts ever. In this respect a separated notice dated March 12, 2020 has been issued by SEBI in the matter of Cash Cow, which also refers to the incorrect transaction period as well as the above noted incorrect account number of Axis Bank.  8.12 A due compliance has been made with the directions passed in the interim order. After the interim order was passed, for the last one year the work has been totally closed as the Noticee has neither taken a single rupee from any fresh and existing clients in the bank__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in respect of M/s Capital Heed Financial Research (Proprietor Mr. Shailendra Sen)    Page 7 of 21                       accounts of Capital Heed nor even in his personal or any other accounts ever. The Noticee is only serving the existing clients for last one year till date. 8.13 A clear instruction has been given to employees to provide right information to the client about all areas which affect the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 decision making for availing the service of Capital Heed. The Noticee has also put the disclaimer on its website and all these activities were done by the Noticee before the interim order was passed.  8.14 The Noticee has also passed the examination i.e., Investment Adviser Level 1 and Level 2, a second time before previous certificate got expired. 8.15 At the time of submission of the documents, the Noticee was not specifically asked if he was ever involved in investment advisory however, the IA application form did mention, if the Noticee was involved in investment advisory services prior to applying for the registration for new company that holds true, as the Noticee was into construction work only, at the time of making the application. The Noticee might have misunderstood the clause and the declaration was made under bonafide believe for which he sincerely tenders apologies and assures to abide by the requisite provisions of the IA Regulations. 9. I have carefully perused the facts recorded in the interim order, the submissions advanced on behalf of the Noticee and other materials available on record. It is noted that the matter against Cash Cow is being dealt with under a separate proceeding and the scope and limitation of the interim order requires me to deal with the allegations made against the Noticee Firm and its sole proprietor Mr. Shailendra Sen (who was also a partner in Cash Cow) registered with SEBI as an investment adviser. In this regard, I also refer to the contention of the Noticee that the facts and circumstances of both Cash Cow and Capital Heed are different. Therefore, the arguments advanced by the Noticee pertaining to Cash Cow which is being dealt with under a separate and independent proceedings pending before a different quasi-judicial authority in SEBI are outside the scope of the proceedings at hand and are thus not being dealt with in this order as contended by the Noticee. In view of the aforesaid, I note that the limited issues that require adjudication in the extant proceedings in light of the charges so levelled are as under: i. Whether the Noticee through it sole proprietor Mr. Shailendra Sen had provided false/misleading information to SEBI while applying and obtaining certificate of registration under IA Regulations for his proprietorship firm Capital Heed, stating that he was not engaged in investment advisory services prior to making the said application and whether he also failed to disclose that earlier as a partner of Cash Cow, he was providing unregistered investment advisory service even after the certificate of registration for Capital Heed was granted to him.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in respect of M/s Capital Heed Financial Research (Proprietor Mr. Shailendra Sen)    Page 8 of 21                       ii. Whether Capital Heed was further, engaged in activities related to PMS by advertising on its website about its PMS business without obtaining a requisite certificate under PMS Regulations, 1993.  10. Before I proceed to examine the aforementioned submissions of the Noticee so as to determine the issues framed above it would be appropriate to refer to the provisions of PMS Regulations and IA Regulations as alleged to have been violated by the Noticee. Accordingly, the said provisions are being reproduced hereunder for facility of ready reference: The IA Regulations, 2013 Conditions of certificate Regulation 13: The certificate granted under Regulation 9 shall, inter alia, be subject to the following conditions: (a) the investment adviser shall abide by the provisions of the Act and these regulations; (b) the investment adviser shall forthwith inform the Board in writing, if any information or particulars previously submitted to the Board are found to be false or misleading in any material particular or if there is any material change in the information already submitted General responsibility. 15.(9) An investment adviser shall abide by Code of Conduct as specified in Third Schedule. Code of Conduct for Investment Adviser 1. Honesty and fairness An investment adviser shall act honestly, fairly and in the best interests of its clients and in the integrity of the market. 8. Compliance An investment adviser including its representative(s) shall comply with all regulatory requirements applicable to the conduct of its business activities so as to promote the best interests of clients and the integrity of the market. \\\\\\\\u2026 The PMS Regulations, 1993 3. Registration as portfolio manager. \\\\\\\\u2500 No person shall act as portfolio manager unless he holds a certificate granted by the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u2026 Issue 1: Whether the Noticee through it sole proprietor Mr. Shailendra Sen had provided false/misleading information to SEBI while applying and obtaining certificate of registration under IA Regulations for his proprietorship firm Capital Heed, stating that he was not engaged in investment advisory services prior to making the said application and whether he also failed to disclose that earlier as a partner of Cash Cow, he__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in respect of M/s Capital Heed Financial Research (Proprietor Mr. Shailendra Sen)    Page 9 of 21                       was providing unregistered investment advisory service even after the certificate of registration for Capital Heed was granted to him. 11. I note from the interim order that the Noticee has falsely stated in \\\\\\\\u2018Form-A\\\\\\\\u2019 filed before SEBI (form prescribed for Application for Grant of Certificate of Registration as an IA) while seeking registration as an investment adviser, that he was not engaged in investment advisory services prior to making the said application and the said act of the Noticee is prima facie in violation of Clauses 1 and 8 of the Code of Conduct for investment adviser read with regulation 15(9) of the IA Regulations. Further, the Noticee also failed to disclose the fact of his earlier conduct of providing unregistered investment advisory service as a partner of Cash Cow even after the certificate of registration for Capital Heed was granted to him and such failure on the part of Noticee has also amounted to prima facie violation of regulation 13(b) of the IA Regulations. The aforesaid commission and omission on the part of the Noticee are also observed to be in violation of regulation 13(a) of the IA Regulations. It is also, prima facie, alleged that the Noticee has misrepresented to investors that it can provide PMS without even holding the certificate of registration as mandatorily required under PMS Regulations and as such, the Noticee has prima facie acted in violation of regulation 3 of the PMS Regulations. 12. The interim order states that during the year 2015, SEBI was in receipt of complaints through SCORES portal against an entity named Cash Cow wherein, it was alleged that the said entity has given the investors a commitment of assured returns. Based on the examination into the affairs of Cash Cow carried out by SEBI, it emerged that one of its partner viz., Mr. Shailendra Sen, based in Indore, is currently registered with SEBI as an investment adviser under the proprietorship named Capital Heed with effect from December 29, 2017.  While examining the act and conduct of Cash Cow, including a scrutiny of the documents submitted by Mr. Shailendra Sen at the time of seeking registration with SEBI as an IA a perusal of \\\\\\\\u2018Form A\\\\\\\\u2019 (form for Application for Grant of Certificate of Registration as an IA) filed by the Noticee revealed the followings: a. Mr. Shailendra Sen, in his application dated September 11, 2017, has declared that he was not engaged in investment advisory services prior to making the said application.  b. To the query as to whether he has ownership/directorship in any companies/ partnership, he has not mentioned about his partnership in Cash Cow. 13. I note that at the time of seeking registration as an investment adviser from SEBI, in \\\\\\\\u2018Form A\\\\\\\\u2019, the applicant has to give a declaration on \\\\\\\\u201cwhether the applicant is engaged in investment advisory services prior to making application under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.  It is noted from the \\\\\\\\u2018Form A\\\\\\\\u2019 submitted__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in respect of M/s Capital Heed Financial Research (Proprietor Mr. Shailendra Sen)    Page 10 of 21                       by Mr. Shailendra Sen that he has declared that he was not engaged in investment advisory services prior to making the said application although Mr. Shailendra Sen, through the partnership firm Cash Cow, had already indulged in unregistered investment advisory activities prior to applying for registration as an IA with SEBI. As noted in the interim order, Mr. Shailendra Sen, while seeking registration from SEBI as an investment adviser in his capacity as the sole proprietor of the Noticee Firm was under the statutory obligation to disclose his prior activities as the partner in the partnership firm, Cash Cow to SEBI. However, for the reason best known to him, he has not made an honest and fair disclosure and rather seems to have concealed material information knowingly by falsely stating in the application form that he was not engaged in investment advisory services prior to filing his application for registration as an IA with SEBI. Thus the Noticee was successful in obtaining registration as an investment adviser on the basis of the said false declaration made by him to SEBI. 14. In this regard I note from the interim order that in response to SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s letter dated February 05, 2015, seeking information from Cash Cow regarding its unregistered investment advisory activities, Mr. Shailendra Sen vide letter dated March 23, 2016 has inter alia admitted that they had started advisory services in August 2014 and have now stopped offering such advisory services with immediate effect and also has stated that they shall offer such advisory services only once they get registered with SEBI. Further, I note that during the course of personal hearing held before me on October 14, 2020, the Noticee admitted that the investment advisory services were being provided to the investors through Cash Cow. I also note that the Noticee has acknowledged the fact that as soon as it was pointed out to them that the business of Cash Cow was being carried out without a mandatory IA registration it was realized by the Noticee that the said business did not constitute a lawful investment advisory service.  15. From a perusal of the interim order, it is noted that the interim order records certain allegations against the Noticee in a categorical manner on the basis of information extracted from the website of Cash Cow itself, as may be seen from the following extract; \\\\\\\\u201cThe following claims regarding Cash Cow were gathered from the entity\\\\\\\\u2019s website www.cashcowresearch.com, which is no longer active:  Cash Cow is a leading financial services company in area of broking and advisory industry in India.  Cash Cow is registered with exchanges, NSE, BSE, MCX, NCDEX, MCX-SX, for providing broking services.  Cash Cow offers Advisory Services, Broking Services, Portfolio Services and__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in respect of M/s Capital Heed Financial Research (Proprietor Mr. Shailendra Sen)    Page 11 of 21                       Fund Management.

Alternatively, payments can be made through PayU Money.\\\\\\\\u201d    16. In response to the allegation inter alia as noted above, it is observed that the Noticee has preferred to remain silent and not made any specific rebuttal by offering any cogent evidences to the contrary so as to refute the charge that Cash Cow was engaged in the activities of rendering unregistered investment advisory services. I note that the Noticee has either baldly denied the allegation merely by explaining that Cash Cow was not in existence and operational at the time when the Noticee made his/its application seeking registration from SEBI. As per the claim of the Noticee, the partnership of Cash Cow stood dissolved by the time the Noticee had applied for registration as an investment advisor. The Noticee has however not denied the fact the he was one of the partners of Cash Cow. However, in response to the allegation against him for making a false declaration in the Form A that he was not engaged in investment advisory services in any manner prior to seeking registration, the Noticee has submitted that Cash Cow had started its advisory services in August 2014 and became a defunct entity sometime in February 2017 and subsequently got dissolved by a deed of dissolution of the said partnership deed dated March 29, 2017. The Noticee has sought to justify his declaration made in Form A by stating that since the activities of Cash Cow was closed and he was engaged in construction work at the time of filing his application with SEBI seeking registration, the declaration so made by him in Form A cannot be viewed as false.  During his personal hearing before me which was held on October 14, 2020, the Noticee himself did not deny that__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in respect of M/s Capital Heed Financial Research (Proprietor Mr. Shailendra Sen)    Page 12 of 21                       investment advisory services were being provided through Cash Cow and rather  reiterated his submission with a request to view the omission in the declaration so given by him in Form A of his application as a solitary unintentional error made on his part for which his registration should not be invalidated.  17. After perusal of the details/documents available on record and consideration of the submissions made by the Noticee, it is found that there is no denial to the fact that the Noticee was connected with Cash Cow which did not possess a SEBI registration to act as an IA. There is also no categorical denial of the fact that Cash Cow was rendering investment advisory services.

Securities and Exchange Board of India ('SEBI') conducted an inspection of Samco Securities Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019), a stock broker registered with SEBI, during August 10-22, 2016 for the period April 01, 2015 to August 09, 2016 to verify compliance with regulatory provisions by the Noticee inter alia in respect of requirements of segregation of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds and securities. Based on the observations during the said inspection and the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s reply thereto, SEBI prima facie found that the Noticee had inter alia misused funds of clients having credit balance for other clients and / or for own purpose on 37 out of 38 sample dates, and thus, had failed to comply with the requirements stipulated in SEBI Circular no.  SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993 and Clause A(5) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified in Schedule II read with Regulations 9(f) and 26(xiii) of the SEBI__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 2 of 23  (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Regulations, 1992 (Stock Brokers Regulations). Therefore, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings and appointed an Adjudicating Officer (AO) inter alia under Section 23-I of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA) to inquire into and adjudicate the said alleged violation under Section 23D of the SCRA.   2. Accordingly, the AO issued a Show Cause Notice dated March 23, 2018 read with Supplementary Show Cause Notice dated July 19, 2019 (SSCN) to the Noticee detailing therein the abovementioned allegations. Subsequently, after conducting an inquiry into the alleged violations by the Noticee, the AO passed an order dated May 29, 2020 (AO Order) disposing of the aforesaid Show Cause Notice without imposing any penalty. The AO Order had observed inter alia the following:  (a) As regards the allegation pertaining to account balances, the Noticee has done verification / revised calculation based on bank statements etc. for all the dates for which SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s Operations Department (OD) has alleged shortfall. (b) Considering the fact that the Noticee, in support of its submissions, has furnished a CA certificate which is substantiated with documents and that the Noticee has confirmed use of bank statements (not just bank books) for all dates for the said CA certificate, there is no evidence on record to differ__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 3 of 23  with the contentions of Noticee. The shortfall in available funds is noted on only two days as against 39 days alleged by the OD, which is also admitted by the Noticee. Thus, it is not a fit case for imposing monetary penalty under Section 23D of the SCRA, for the said two instances of shortfall.   3. However, SEBI, upon calling for and examining the records of the abovementioned adjudication proceedings, observed the following:  (a) In respect of the fund balances available with the Noticee, as mentioned in the SCN, the Noticee has provided increased figures of fund balances in the range of Rs.2.87 Lakh to Rs.99 Crores. However, no explanation was provided by the Noticee as to how it arrived at the revised figures which were originally not refuted by it while replying to the findings of inspection vide letter dated November 21, 2016 and also while replying vide letter dated December 05, 2017 to SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s letter issuing administrative warning to the Noticee for other violations. (b) A sample verification of eight bank statements on 5 dates revealed that the figures given in CA certificates do not tally with the bank statements and it appeared to be inflated. (c) As regards the credit balances of clients available with the Noticee, the data required for this purpose was taken by the inspection team from trial balance across stock exchange, after adjusting for open bills, uncleared__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 4 of 23  cheques and the margin obligations. However, in its reply to the SCN, the Noticee reduced the figures with respect to the credit balances of the clients in the range of Rs.1.6 Crores to Rs.51 Crores without offering any explanation. Further, the Noticee had not challenged the original figures either while replying to communication of findings of inspection vide letter dated November 21, 2016 and also while replying vide letter dated December 05, 2017 to SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s letter issuing administrative warning to the Noticee for other violations.  4. It was thus observed that the AO had accepted the revised figures provided by the Noticee even though the Noticee had not provided any plausible explanation in respect of such revised figures. In view of the same, SEBI was of the view that the AO order, in as much as not holding the Noticee liable for the abovementioned alleged violation and not imposing penalty, under Section 23D of the SCRA, was erroneous to the extent it was not in the interests of the securities market.   5. Accordingly, SEBI issued a show cause notice dated August 20, 2020 under Section 23-I(3) of the SCRA to the Noticee calling upon it to show cuase as to why penalty under Section 23D of the SCRA should not be imposed on the Noticee for the abovementioned alleged  violation.__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 5 of 23  6. The Noticee replied to the SCN vide letter dated September 16, 2020 and October 13, 2020. The Noticee vide letter dated October 13, 2016 and a follow-up letter dated November 23, 2020 sought certain clarification on the contents of SCN and the same were provided to the Noticee vide email dated December 02, 2020. Vide the said email dated December 02, 2020, certain figures mentioned in para 4(a) of the SCN stood modified.  7. The Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing on December 22, 2020, which was attended by Shri Vipul Modi (Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s director) and Shri Chintan Shingala (Compliance Officer). During the personal hearing, the Noticee reiterated the submissions made earlier and also submitted a letter dated December 22, 2020 containing additional submissions. Subsequently, the Noticee made further written submissions vide letter dated January 20, 2021.  8. The Noticee vide letters dated September 16, 2020, October 13, 2020, December 22, 2020 and January 20, 2021 and during the abovementioned personal hearing has submitted inter alia the following:  (a) The Noticee denies the allegations made in the SCN. (b) From the provisions of Section 23-I(3) of the SCRA, it is clear that no order under this sub-section can be passed after an expiry of three months from the date of order passed by the AO. Since the AO order was passed on May__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 6 of 23  29, 2020, no order can be passed under Section 23-I(3) after August 28, 2020. As the said timeline is already over, the SCN issued by SEBI has become invalid. (c) The provisions of Section 23-I(3) can be invoked only to enhance the quantum of penalty and it cannot be applied to cases where AO did not find it fit to impose monetary penalty. (d) Since the inspection of the Noticee and the issuance of SCN by SEBI was done by the same department of SEBI, it is a violation of principles of natural justice which provide that no man shall be a judge in his own cause. (e) The order passed by the AO is a detailed speaking order and cannot be said to be erroneous. (f) As regards the calculation of balance in all client bank accounts, considering the then existing banking ecosystem involving delays in clearance of cheques, the book balance should be taken into account rather than the bank statement balance. Further, while calculating the total credit balance of all clients, margin obligations of the clients also have to be taken into account for arriving at the final figure, which has not been done by the SEBI Inspection Team. (g) Further, the inspection period is prior to coming into effect of SEBI Circular dated September 26, 2016 pertaining to enhanced supervision of stock brokers / DPs and thus should not be applied.__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 7 of 23  (h) As regards the fund balances available with the Noticee, it is alleged in the SCN that (i) the Noticee has provided increased figures of the fund balances (revised figures) without giving explanation, (ii) the original figures were not refuted by the Noticee in the earlier communications, and (iii) the sample verification of figures given by the Noticee of figures given by the Noticee as per CA certificate does not match with bank statements and appears inflated. However, in this regard, the Noticee submits that the AO in para 8 and 13 of the AO Order has observed that the Noticee has substantiated all the working with the help of CA certificate with supporting documents and the same was also conveyed to the OD. The Annexure I of the CA certificate wherein working of \\\\\\\\u201cG\\\\\\\\u201d was provided, in Column A it was clearly mentioned that the amount taken was \\\\\\\\u201cTotal of end of the day balance in all client and settlement accounts as per Bank books\\\\\\\\u201d which is considered by the AO in his order. Further, in the SCN issued by the MIRSD, in the working provided as Annexure C in the said Original and Supplementary SCN, it is also clearly mentioned as \\\\\\\\u201cTotal of end of the day balance in all client & settlement accounts as per Bank books\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, it is amply clear that the order passed by AO relied on the figures on the basis of Annexure as submitted by the Noticee with explanation and did not find any objection to the same. The AO has decided the matter on merit and on legal grounds after detailed deliberation and recording reasons.__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 8 of 23  (i) In Annexure C of the SCN, from the differences provided i.e. (SCN balance \\\\\\\\u2013 reply balance), it appears that there are 15 instances in which Total of end of day balance in all bank accounts are greater than Total of end of day balance in all clients and settlement bank accounts as per bank book, which reflects the figures taken in the working on same basis throughout. The AO, after relying on the working given by the Noticee and subsequently communicating with the OD, has accepted the working on merit. Further, in the Annexure C, the calculation given for the date 15-06-2015 was wrong and the said mistake has been subsequently admitted by SEBI as per email dated December 02, 2020. Considering the same, the total number of positive instances increases to 16 in which Total of end of day balance in all client bank accounts are greater than Total of end of the day balance in all clients and settlement bank accounts as per bank book. Thus, the allegation in the SCN that no explanation was provided by the Noticee for revised figures is contrary to the facts and devoid of merit. (j) Further, the allegation in the SCN that the Noticee had not refuted the original figures in its past communications is also not true. The Noticee had refuted the allegations of misutilization of funds with detailed explanation, which is evident from Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s letters dated November 21, 2016 and December 05, 2017.  The same is also supported by the observations of the AO in para 6 of the AO Order.__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 9 of 23  (k) As regards the working provided in Annexure D in the SCN, the same is done on sample basis and not in totality. Further, in the working given in Annexure D, comparison is given with respect to balances as per bank (ledger) and balances as per bank statements and the differences are calculated to find out short reporting or excess reporting. The said differences are not done for all bank accounts and only sample bank accounts. The working provided does not seem to match with the excess reported figures and thus cannot be relied upon. For instance, for the date 28.04.2016, the excess figure reported and given in the SCN amounts to Rs.21,947,769.53. However, on the perusal of the working provided in support, the short reporting appears to be more than the excess reporting. As per the working given in Annexure D for the said date, total of excess reporting is Rs.384558 and the total of short reporting is Rs.64329981.6, which comes to Net Short Reporting of Rs.63945423.16. However, as per the working provided in Annexure D, the excess reported is to the extent of Rs.21947769.53. For the date 15.04.2016, the excess reported also does not match with the working provided wherein excess reported is Rs.26273399.34 whereas as per the calculation provided in support it comes to Rs.25985739.32.  The Noticee thus submits that the working provided for determining the excess reporting on sample basis are contrary to facts and as such the SCN issued on such basis is defective and bad in law.__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 10 of 23  (l) As regards the credit balances of the clients available with the Noticee, the SCN has alleged that the Noticee has given revised figures without explanation and that the original figures were not refuted in earlier communications by the Noticee. It appears from the calculation provided in Annexure E to the SCN that total credit balance of all clients was taken after adjusting open bills and uncleared cheques. However, as per the reply submitted before the AO, the total credit balance of all clients was taken after adjusting open bills, uncleared cheques and adjusted margins as per client trial balance, and such revised working was considered by the AO after detailed deliberation and communication with the OD, as evident from point 8 of the AO Order. The calculation of G in terms of the said SEBI Circular as done by OD has been recalculated by Noticee by taking into consideration the margin requirements etc. The Noticee substantiated its reply regarding re-calculation of Post Inspection Analysis (PIA) Table with CA certificate dated July 18, 2019 along with supporting documents. Further, the Noticee also submitted the same table as working on December 10, 2019. Accordingly, it is amply clear that the said working was duly accepted and all explanations were provided for the same. Therefore, allegations that no explanation was provided by the Noticee for the revised figures and that the AO has not recorded plausible explanation for accepting the revised figures are devoid of merit. The AO has passed the AO Order after detailed deliberation and recording reasons.__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 11 of 23  (m) Further, the allegations that the Noticee had not refuted the original figures in its past communications is also not correct. The Noticee had done so vide letter dated November 21, 2016 and December 05, 2017 which are available on record. The same is also evident from the observations of the AO in para 6 of the AO Order. (n) The Noticee also refers to its submissions made before the AO and seeks to rely on them. (o) The Noticee reiterates that there is no misutilization, as alleged. As regards the working of \\\\\\\\u201cG\\\\\\\\u201d in Annexure I submitted by the Noticee, the Noticee submits that during the relevant time, clients having debit balances were putting collateral of securities for margin with the clearing corporation / clearing member which are implicitly available for margin exposure or trading limit purposes of credit balance clients and therefore to that extent the same needs to be adjusted reduced / considered. Further, in addition to the above, there were securities which were infused by promoters for working capital which were kept as collateral with clearing corporation / clearing member to take care of credit balance clients\\\\\\\\u2019 obligations. Thus, there is no misutilization of credit balance of client for debit balance of clients. To illustrate the above, if we assume that total credit balance of all clients is say Rs.1,00,000/- without margin and the clients have utilized margin of Rs.40,000, the net clear balance available for payout would be only Rs.60,000/-. In the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s case, there was not a single instance where__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 12 of 23  the funds of credit balance clients were not available to them for trading or payout. Further, the infusion of promoter\\\\\\\\u2019s capital and collaterals available of debit balance clients placed with the clearing corporation or clearing member would cover the net credit balances of the clients. This clearly means that there was no misutilization of credit balance clients in letter and spirit. Also, there was no own /prop trading done by the Noticee at any point of time. The alleged working of \\\\\\\\u201cG\\\\\\\\u201d was done in more technical way based on subsequent circular. Further, it must be noted that during the relevant time, there was no standard format nor was there any software / technical support for the same to do the calculation in a particular way and therefore, the Noticee requests SEBI to take a lenient view, considering that there was no misutilization, as alleged. The Noticee has a clean track record and it is in full compliance with all applicable guidelines and regulations as amended from time to time. Consideration of issues: 9.  I have considered the charges against the Noticee mentioned in the SCN, findings of the AO, the reply of the Noticee and other material available on record. Now, I proceed to decide the issue at hand.  10. At the outset, the Noticee has contended that an order under the provisions of Section 23-I(3) cannot be passed after expiry of 3 months from the date of the__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 13 of 23  AO Order. It has further contended that the provisions of Section 23-I(3) can be applied  invoked only to enhance the quantum of penalty and not a case where AO did not find it fit to impose monetary penalty. In this regard, I am of the view that the time limit prescribed under Section 23-I(3) of the SCRA is for initiation of action rather than passing of order, as claimed by the Noticee. The interpretation of the above provisions as contended by the Noticee does not appear to be logical since the passing of order within three months of an AO Order may not be feasible for a variety of reasons which may not be within control of SEBI. Thus, the contention of the Noticee cannot be accepted. As regards the invocation of Section 23-I(3) for imposing monetary penalty in cases where the AO has not deemed it fit to impose monetary penalty, in my view, such exercise of power appears logical under the said provision since any penalty imposed would be an enhancement over nil penalty. Thus, the preliminary objections raised by the Noticee do not sustain.  11. I note that the charge against the Noticee, which is the subject matter of adjudication under the current proceedings pertains to violations of the provisions of SEBI Circular no. SEBI Circular no. SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993 (\\\\\\\\u201c1993 Circular\\\\\\\\u201d in short), which inter alia prohibits mis-utilisation of a client\\\\\\\\u2019s funds for other clients or for the broker\\\\\\\\u2019s own purposes. In order to ascertain whether the above circular was being implemented by the Noticee, the SEBI inspection had identified a sample of 48__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 14 of 23  dates, on which the margins in CDS & F&O segments and the pay-in obligations were highest during the inspection period. For these dates, to ascertain whether clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds were not used for purposes other than the settlement of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 obligations / clients\\\\\\\\u2019 trading, it was verified whether the total funds lying in the clients and settlement bank accounts (as per bank statements) and the fixed / cash deposits placed with the exchange as margin deposits are equal to or in excess of gross credit balances of all the clients at the end of the day as per trial balance, excluding debits / credits for unsettled trades. It was revealed that in 39 instances, total cash and cash equivalents lying in the clients and settlement bank accounts and with the stock exchanges / clearing corporations at the end of the day were less than gross credit balances, which indicated that the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds were mis-utilized for settlement of obligations of debit balance clients or were used for broker\\\\\\\\u2019s own purposes.  A table containing a summary of such shortfall on 39 days was provided to the Noticee after inspection, which was later revised to 38 days. The revised sheet was provided as Annexure C to the SSCN dated July 19, 2019 issued by the AO.  12. I note from the revised calculation sheet (PIA Table) prepared by the OD (which is provided as Annexure C to the SSCN dated July 19, 2019 and quoted under Para 6 of the AO Order) that for the purpose of determining any misutilization of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds on any given date, the total funds available with the broker on a given date is calculated, which is the sum total of the following:__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 15 of 23   (a) Total of end of day balance in all client bank accounts; and (b) Collateral deposited with clearing corporation / clearing member in the form of cash and cash equivalents (i.e. cash, FD and amount of bank guarantee funded by cash or cash equivalent).  13. Once the total funds available for the day are determined as per above calculation, the value of misutilization is calculated by deducting the total credit balances of all clients from the total funds available. If such calculation results in a negative value, the said value indicates the extent of misutilization of the funds of clients having credit balances.  14. I note from the records that during the adjudication proceedings, the Noticee had contested the abovementioned PIA Table showing total funds available with the broker for 39 days, prepared by the OD and provided as Annexure C to the SSCN dated July 19, 2019. In this regard, I note that the Noticee had submitted to the AO, a different calculation sheet as being the correct one, certified by a CA. I note that the difference in the figures mentioned in the Tables prepared by OD and that by the Noticee arose on account of the fact that while the \\\\\\\\u201cTotal of end of day balance in all client bank accounts\\\\\\\\u201d (figures in Column A of the revised PIA Table) had been calculated by the OD on the basis of client bank account statements, the Noticee had calculated the corresponding figures on the basis of bank books. Further, in its calculation sheet, the OD had__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 16 of 23  calculated the \\\\\\\\u201cTotal credit balances of all clients\\\\\\\\u201d (figures mentioned in Column E of the revised PIA Table) by adjusting the margin obligations, whereas the Noticee had calculated the corresponding figures without adjusting the margin obligations. According to the calculation sheet prepared by the Noticee, the amounts with \\\\\\\\u201cnegative sign indicating misutilization of credit balance clients\\\\\\\\u2019 money\\\\\\\\u201d (corresponding to figures mentioned in Column H of the revised PIA Table) were present only for two dates, as against 38 alleged by the OD.   15. Thus, the calculation sheets prepared by the OD and the Noticee differ on account of two factors: (a) calculation of bank balances as per bank statements versus bank books, and (b) calculation of credit balances of clients with adjusted margins versus those without adjusted margins. Now, I proceed to look into both the issues one by one.  16. As regards the clients account balances, I deem it important to point out that while the figures in bank books include uncleared cheques, the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 bank accounts statements indicate the actual balances available in such accounts. Since uncleared cheques may remain unrealised / unpaid until the cheques are cleared, it is quite logical and reasonable to take into account the bank statements rather than figures of bank books. The said method of calculation of total available funds based on actual bank balances (i.e. as per bank statement)__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 17 of 23  has also been incorporated in the Circular No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated September 26, 2016, which is a mere reiteration of the underlying principle laid down vide the 1993 Circular.  17. I note that the calculation sheet prepared by the Noticee, along with the CA certificate submitted to the AO, was forwarded to the OD for its comments. The OD in its reply to the AO observed the following: (a) The CA firm in its certificate has mentioned that the verification of client ledgers, bank books, margin reports and other relevant records was done on sampling basis. However, it may be noted that end of the day bank balances in all clients & settlement accounts were as per bank statement and not bank books\\\\\\\\u201d (b) The certificate provided by the entity was on the basis of brokers books of accounts such as bank book and did not rely upon the bank statements (as it is evident from the certificate). The table (\\\\\\\\u2018G\\\\\\\\u2019) was prepared on the basis of bank statements, which are more reliable in specific to misutilisation of funds\\\\\\\\u201d  18. The above comments of OD were forwarded by the AO to the Noticee. In response to the same, the Noticee sent a revised CA Certificate dated December 09, 2019, which inter alia stated that \\\\\\\\u201cThis is to certify that based on the verification of the client ledgers, bank books, margin reports, bank statements, bank reconciliation statements, client ledger trial balances, journal book & other relevant records of the trading member in BSE/NSE provided to us, the balances / details certified as per__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 18 of 23  Annexure are true and correct.\\\\\\\\u201d While forwarding the said CA certificate, the Noticee in its covering letter dated December 09, 2019 stated that \\\\\\\\u201cthe new CA certificate clarifies that the verification is done of all clients (not sample basis) and it is based on verification of all relevant records including bank statements.\\\\\\\\u201d    19. I note that the AO in the AO Order has relied upon the said CA certificates to conclude that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026Noticee has done verification / revised calculation based on Bank Statements etc for all the dates for which the OD alleged shortfall. \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026Having regard to the fact that Noticee, in support of its submissions, has furnished a CA certificate which is substantiated before me with documents, and that Noticee has confirmed use of bank statements (not just bank books) for all dates, for CA certificate, and that there is no evidence on record to differ with contentions of Noticee, I therefore conclude that shortfall is noted in two instances out of the 39 alleged by OD and charged in SCNs, which is also the admitted position by Noticee\\\\\\\\u2026. \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 Having regard to the material on record and aforesaid case laws cited by the Noticee, I do not find it is a fit case for imposing monetary penalty, for the said two instances of shortfall\\\\\\\\u201d  20. I note that the OD has challenged the abovementioned findings of the AO as being erroneous. The OD has contended that the Noticee has not provided any plausible explanation in its support of the revised calculation provided by it and certified by its CA, according to which the available fund balances were in excess of credit balances of all clients, except on two days.__________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited                                                                            Page 19 of 23  21. Upon examination of the available records, I note that the Noticee had relied on the revised CA certificate which referred to \\\\\\\\u201cthe bank statements\\\\\\\\u201d among the documents used for calculating the client account balances. In this regard, I note that the Noticee had not provided the details of such calculation and any explanation as to how it had arrived at the revised figures in its calculation sheet. However, the AO in the AO order has erroneously observed that the CA certificate produced before her is substantiated with documents.  22. I further note that the CA certificate furnished by the Noticee certifies that \\\\\\\\u201cbased on verification of client ledgers, bank books, margin reports, bank statements, bank reconciliation statements, client ledger trial balances, journal book & other relevant records of the trading member in BSE / NSE provided to us, the balances / details certified as per Annexure are true and correct.\\\\\\\\u201d This indicates that the certification of \\\\\\\\u201cTotal of end of the day balance in all clients & settlement accounts\\\\\\\\u201d for different dates by the CA was not done entirely on the basis of \\\\\\\\u201cbank statements\\\\\\\\u201d but also \\\\\\\\u201cbank books\\\\\\\\u201d. In fact, in the Annexure attached to the CA Certificate, the heading of Column-A in which such day balances are provided, reads as \\\\\\\\u201cTotal of end of the day balance in all clients & settlement bank accounts as per bank books\\\\\\\\u201d. The same indicates that the calculation of client bank account balances by the Noticee has been done on the basis of bank books and not bank statement, as claimed. However, I note that the AO in the AO order has observed that \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee has confirmed use of bank statements (n", "Date": "2021-05-31", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Order in respect of Samco Securities Limited [SAT Appeal No.:493/2021]", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/may-2021/order-in-respect-of-samco-securities-limited_50324.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 63136, "unique_record_id": "1790919b1aSEBI20210531", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6682251678589103064730b8", "parse_date": "2024-07-01 03:39:29", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Non-compliance", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "No financial penalties mentioned.", "gpt_audience": "- Regulatory authorities\n- Stock brokers\n- Compliance officers\n- Legal professionals\n- Financial auditors\n- Investors\n- Financial analysts\n- SEBI officials\n- Corporate governance experts\n- Risk management professionals", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "- Shri Vipul Modi (Noticees director)\n- Shri Chintan Shingala (Compliance Officer)", "gpt_summary": "SEBI conducted an inspection of Samco Securities Limited, revealing misuse of client funds.

V AAKPV6612K  (collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d)  In the matter of Infosys Limited   Background 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) alert system had generated insider trading alerts for the scrip of Infosys Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cINFY\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cCompany\\\\\\\\u201d) for the period around July 15, 2020 i.e. around the corporate announcement of audited financial results of INFY for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 made to BSE and NSE.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of insider trading in shares of Infosys Limited                                                                                       Page 2 of 55  2. Thereafter, based on the aforesaid alert, SEBI conducted a preliminary examination in the scrip of INFY to ascertain whether certain persons / entities traded in the said scrip while they were in possession of / on the basis of unpublished price sensitive information in contravention of the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) read with the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPIT Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d).  3. INFY is a public company incorporated on July 02, 1981. The company is listed on both NSE and BSE. The scrip is in Future and Option segment (\\\\\\\\u201cF&O Segment\\\\\\\\u201d) and is a part of SENSEX and NIFTY.  SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s Examination:  4. SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s preliminary examination prima facie observed the following:  4.1. The corporate announcement of audited financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 was made by INFY to BSE and NSE on July 15, 2020. 4.2. The information relating to the financial results of INFY, including basic financial parameters of profit & loss (P&L) and balance sheet (BS) as well as key financial and operational parameters which contribute to various elements of the P&L and BS for the quarter ending June 30, 2020 was Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe UPSI\\\\\\\\u201d).  4.3. Based on an extract of the Structured Digital Database related to the financial results of INFY for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the UPSI came into existence on June 29, 2020. Thus, the UPSI period was from June 29, 2020 to July 15, 2020. 4.4. Mr. Pranshu Bhutra (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPranshu\\\\\\\\u201d / Noticee No. 1), Senior Corporate Counsel of INFY, being an officer / employee of INFY is a connected person and was reasonably expected to have access to the UPSI and on preponderance of probability basis he was in possession of the UPSI. Thus, Pranshu is an insider.  4.5. Mr. Amit Bhutra (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAmit\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee No. 2\\\\\\\\u201d) is connected with Pranshu (an insider) (a) through frequent telephonic communication; (b) Pranshu had a__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of insider trading in shares of Infosys Limited                                                                                       Page 3 of 55 fund transaction with Mahrishi Alloys Private Limited (Mahrishi) and soon thereafter Mahrishi had fund transaction with Shyama Devi Bhutra (Mother of Amit) and (c) Ram Bilas Bhutra (Father of Pranshu) and Amit are both directors in the Board of Mahrishi.  Thus, Amit is a connected person and is reasonably expected to have an access to the UPSI and therefore, he is an insider and on preponderance of probability basis was in possession of the UPSI procured from Pranshu.     4.6. Mr. Bharath C. Jain (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBharath\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee No. 3\\\\\\\\u201d) and Amit are partners of Capital One Partners. Amit and Bharath are connected through (a) professional relationship and (b) frequent telephonic communication. Thus, Bharath is a connected person and is reasonably expected to have access to the UPSI through Amit and on preponderance of probability basis he was in possession of the UPSI. Hence, Bharath had procured UPSI from Amit and was in possession of the UPSI. Thus, Bharath is an insider. 4.7. As per the partnership deed of Capital One Partners (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cCapital One\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee No. 4\\\\\\\\u201d), Amit and Bharath are working partners of Capital One.  4.8. As per the partnership deed of Tesora Capital (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cTesora\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee No. 5\\\\\\\\u201d), Amit, Ankush Bhutra and Manish Champalal Jain are working partners of Tesora. 4.9. Capital One and Tesora had traded in the scrip of INFY in the F&O segment just prior to announcement of financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and soon after the announcement, subsequently offloaded / squared off their positions such that net positions were zero. Amit and Bharath, both had placed orders / given trading instructions on behalf of Capital One. Amit had placed orders / given trading instructions on behalf of Tesora. Thus, Capital One and Tesora had traded in the scrip of INFY in F&O segment while in possession of UPSI.  4.10. Due to this trading, Capital One Partners had generated proceeds of Rs.279.51 lakhs and Tesora Capital had generated proceeds of Rs 26.82 lakhs. 4.11. While Capital One and Tesora regularly traded in a variety of scrips, from the trading pattern of Capital One and Tesora, during the period from January 01, 2020 to October 31, 2020, it is observed that Capital One and Tesora has significant trading activity in__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of insider trading in shares of Infosys Limited                                                                                       Page 4 of 55 the scrip of INFY only during the weeks adjacent / close to the dates of corporate announcement of financial results for the quarters December \\\\\\\\u2013 2019, March \\\\\\\\u2013 2020, June \\\\\\\\u2013 2020 and September 2020. The trading concentration of Capital One and Tesora in the scrip of INFY had increased drastically during the said weeks. Thus, Capital One and Tesora have the same repetitive pattern of trading in the scrip of INFY during periods close to the announcement of financial results. 4.12. Thus, in view of the foregoing, Noticee No. 1 to 5 had prime facie violated the provision of SEBI Act and PIT Regulations, 2015. 4.13. Separately, Mr. Venkata Subramaniam V. V (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cVenkata\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee No. 8\\\\\\\\u201d), Senior Principal, Corporate Accounting Group of INFY, has been identified as a Designated Person by INFY for the purpose of the UPSI. By virtue of being a Designated Person, Venkata was reasonably expected to have an access to and be in possession of the UPSI. Thus, Venkata is an insider. It is noted that Venkata has been in frequent communication with / is connected with Pranshu through (a) professional relationship (both are officers / employees of INFY) and (b) telephonic communication during the UPSI period. Thus, Pranshu is also reasonably expected to have access to the UPSI through Venkata and on preponderance of probability basis he was in possession of the UPSI. Therefore, in addition to being a connected person as mentioned in para 4.4, by virtue of this additional connection also, Pranshu is a connected person, and thereby an insider. Hence, on a preponderance of probability basis, Venkata had communicated the UPSI to Pranshu and Pranshu had procured UPSI from Venkata and thereby Venkata and Pranshu had prime facie violated the provision of SEBI Act and PIT Regulations.  CONSIDERATION & PRIMA FACIE FINDINGS  5. I have perused the findings of the preliminary examination conducted by SEBI and other material available on record. On perusal of the same, following prima facie issues arise for consideration:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of insider trading in shares of Infosys Limited                                                                                       Page 5 of 55 5.1. Issue No. 1: Whether information relating to the financial results of INFY including basic financial parameters of profit & loss (P&L) and balance sheet (BS) as well as key financial and operational parameters which contribute to various elements of the P&L and BS for the quarter ending June 30, 2020 was UPSI. If so, what was the UPSI Period?  5.2. Issue No. 2: Whether Pranshu, Amit and Bharath are insiders in terms of PIT Regulations, 2015? 5.3.  Issue No. 3: Whether Amit and Bharath, while in possession of and on the basis of UPSI, had traded in the scrip of INFY on behalf of Capital One? 5.4. Issue No. 4: Whether Amit, while in possession of and on the basis of UPSI, had traded in the scrip of INFY on behalf of Tesora? 5.5. Issue No. 5: Based on the answers to issue Nos. 1 to 4, whether there are the relevant provisions of SEBI Act and PIT Regulations that have been violated by Noticee No. 1 to 5 and who all are prima facie liable for the same?  5.6. Issue No. 6: Whether Venkata is an insider and whether there is prima facie evidence that he had also communicated the UPSI to Pranshu? If yes, then what are the relevant provisions of SEBI Act and PIT Regulations that have been violated by them? 5.7. Issue No. 7: On determination of the above issues, whether urgent directions, if any, should be issued in the present matter?  6. In order to determine the issues raised in the foregoing paragraph, it would be sufficient to examine, whether the relevant Noticees, as insiders, traded while in possession of UPSI. However, in the instant case, prima facie, the preliminary examination, has brought out that the impugned trading is also prima facie on the basis of UPSI. In this regard, a discussion on Delta analysis of the trading by the Noticees would be relevant as it stands as one of the evidences of how an entity has traded in the market on the basis of UPSI. Therefore, a brief discussion on the signification of delta analysis is brought out below. 6.1.   By way of an illustration, if an insider was in possession of positive UPSI about a Company, and traded while in possession of such UPSI, he would be expected to buy the shares of the Company before such information became public. Once the information__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of insider trading in shares of Infosys Limited                                                                                       Page 6 of 55 became public, since it was positive in nature, it would be expected that the share price of the company would go up and the insider would then sell the shares at such higher price, thereby making a profit using the UPSI. It may be noted though, that the policy of the PIT Regulation is to prevent dealing in securities, while in possession of UPSI irrespective of whether the UPSI is positive or negative and irrespective of whether profit is made or not.  6.2. If the UPSI happened to be negative, then the insider would be expected to sell the shares of the Company at a particular price before the UPSI became public (including short selling if he did not already hold the shares). Once the information became public, since it was negative in nature, it would be expected that the share price of the Company would fall and the insider would then buy the shares at such lower price, thereby closing his short selling position at a profit (sold higher, bought back lower), using the UPSI.   6.3. The illustration described above is with reference to the cash segment of the market where the shares of the companies are bought and sold. However, over the years, the derivatives segment of the market has become multiple times the size of the cash segment and Futures and Options (F&O) have become an even bigger opportunity for an insider to make profit using UPSI. In fact, the F&O segment gives the insider a very \\\\\\\\u201cefficient\\\\\\\\u201d route to making unlawful gains. Cash segment is settled on T+2 basis whereas F&O segment is settled on the last Thursday of the month (settlement date). Thus, the insider can keep his buy/sell position open for longer in the F&O segment, without having to settle the trade. During this time, the insider is only required to post margin for his trades, and not pay for the value of the full shares. Thus, with even a relatively small amount of money, he can take large leveraged positions in the F&O segment for a much larger number of shares. 6.4. By way of an illustration, in Futures, the modus operandi of the insider is very similar to the cash segment since buying a Future today in a particular Company at a particular price is effectively a commitment to buy a share of that Company on settlement date at that price. Similarly on selling Futures of a particular scrip at a particular price today, there is effectively a commitment to deliver the shares on the settlement date at that particular price. In general, the Futures price of a share moves in tandem with the price__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of insider trading in shares of Infosys Limited                                                                                       Page 7 of 55 of the underlying share. So, if the UPSI is positive, the insider will buy Futures of the Company before the UPSI becomes public, and sell the Futures after the price has gone up subsequent to the UPSI becoming public. Similarly, if the UPSI is negative, he would first sell Futures of the Company before the UPSI becomes public and buy the Futures back at a lower price after the UPSI has become public. Thereby booking a profit.  6.5. In the case of Options, the mechanism works a little differently since there are a large number of possible permutations and computations in terms of the positions that the insider can take. And for each of these positions, there can be a large number of strike prices that the insider chooses based on his assessment of how much the price of the share will go up or down. 6.6. By way of an illustration, let us assume that the Current Market Price (CMP) of a Company\\\\\\\\u2019s share is Rs 100. If the UPSI is positive, and the insider expects the share price to go up. Thus, he would want to buy a call option. Suppose he buys the Call option at a strike price of Rs 100/- only i.e. at CMP itself. In this transaction, the Intrinsic Value of the option would be zero (0) since strike price = CMP. So he would need to pay only for Time Value of the Option. This would be a relatively a small amount. Depending on the volatility of the share price and time left till expiry, let us assume that this is 2% of the CMP i.e. Rs 2/- (Rupees two only) per share. After the UPSI becomes public and the Market Price of the share goes up from Rs 100/- to say Rs 105/-, the price of that Call Option will move significantly. Firstly, the Intrinsic Value of the Option itself will become Rs. 5/- (CMP-strike price). In addition, the time value would also stay approximately the same i.e. Rs. 2/-, if the time to expiry is still approximately the same. Thus, the total value would be Rs 7/-. Now the insider would sell the option he is holding, at this price, and book a profit of Rs 5/- thereby earning a return of 2.5 times on his investment. 6.7. If the UPSI is negative, he would Sell a Call Option, wait for the price of the share (and therefore the price of the Call Option) to fall post UPSI becoming public, and buy it back at a lower cost, thereby booking a profit. 6.8. Following similar logic, it would be observed that if the UPSI is positive, the insider might also choose to Sell a put option, apart from buying Futures or buying a Call__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of insider trading in shares of Infosys Limited                                                                                       Page 8 of 55 Option as described above. And if the UPSI is negative, he may choose to Buy a Put Option, apart from selling Futures or selling a Call Option. As mentioned earlier, options can be bought and sold at various strike prices (in the illustration above, a strike price equal to the prevailing market price was taken @ Rs 100. However, the market offers many alternative strike prices, both above and below the prevailing market price) 6.9. Since the various permutations and combinations of positions as outlined above can create complexity, it is important to find a single measure that captures the overall net position of the trader in terms of whether the overall net position reflects that he is expecting the price of the share to go up or down. This is particularly important when analyzing the trades/positions of a person who is indulging in Insider Trading since such a person may try and camouflage his directional view (share price expected to go up or down) by taking some positions contrary to his directional view while overall his net positions show a clear directional view. 6.10. A metric called the \\\\\\\\u201cDelta\\\\\\\\u201d of the positions is such a metric that is used by the market and the traders to monitor their overall net position across all their trades/positions. Essentially, the net Delta of the various positions taken by the insider, indicates: 6.10.1. What the net overall directional view of the insider is i.e. does he expect the share price to go up or down? 6.10.2. If the view is positive, and if the share price of the company goes up by Rs 1, how much approximate profit will the insider make? 6.10.3. If the view is negative, and if the share price of the company goes down by Rs 1, how much approximate profit will the insider make? 6.10.4. If the view of the insider turns out to be wrong (i.e. He expects share price to go up, but it goes down OR he expects share price to go down, but it goes up) then how much approximate loss will he make? 6.10.5. How confident is the insider about his view? 6.11. For example, if the insider thinks that the share price will go up, then the net Delta of his positions will be positive, say 1,00,000, and this means that for every Rs 1 increase in the share price, the insider will make an approximate profit of Rs 1,00,000/-. But if__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of insider trading in shares of Infosys Limited                                                                                       Page 9 of 55 his view goes wrong, and the share price goes down, then for every Rs 1 fall in the share price, he will make an approximate loss of Rs 1,00,000/-. 6.12. Similarly, if the insider thinks that the share price will go down then the net Delta of his positions will be negative, say -1,00,000, it means that for every Rs 1 fall in the price of the company\\\\\\\\u2019s share price, the insider will make an approximate profit of Rs 1,00,000/-. But if his view goes wrong, and the share price goes up, then for every Rs 1 increase in share price, he will make an approximate loss of Rs 1,00,000/-. 6.13. As can be seen above, the cost of the view going wrong is as high as the benefit of the view being right. Thus, when an insider runs a high Delta, [either (+) or (-)] it shows that he is very confident about his view. Particularly when his Delta in that share is compared with the Delta he runs in other shares (if he is a regular trader) OR with the Delta he runs in the same share when he does NOT have UPSI. 6.14. Insiders may try and defend themselves by pointing to some of their transactions which are contrary to the overall directional view. They may claim that if they had UPSI, they would try and maximize their profit and the fact that they entered into contrary trades shows that this was not the case. However, it is noted that such contrary trades can be entered into for two reasons: 6.14.1. Precisely to camouflage their main trades and to try and build a defence on these lines which is belied by their overall net Delta. 6.14.2. In order to execute their main trades, they need funds either to buy options or to furnish margins. In order to generate some amount of funds for this purpose, they may enter into contrary trades, particularly options at strike prices that they are confident about, to generate funds. 6.15. This is why net Delta is such a powerful metric, because it nets out all the camouflage and all the complexity, and gives a simple measure of how much approximate profit the insider stands to make if his directional view based on the UPSI turns out to be right, and equally, how much loss he stands to make if his directional view turns out to be wrong.  7. Given the above background on Delta, I proceed with the determination of prima facie findings of the present case:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of insider trading in shares of Infosys Limited                                                                                       Page 10 of 55   ISSUE No. 1:  Whether information relating to the financial results of INFY including basic financial parameters of P&L and BS as well as key financial and operational parameters which contribute to various elements of the P&L and BS for the quarter ending June 30, 2020 was UPSI. If so, what was the UPSI Period?   8. I note that INFY had made an announcement on July 15, 2020 (Wednesday), on NSE at 16:21:00 and on BSE at 16:21:34 regarding audited financial results (Standalone and Consolidated) as per both INDAS and IFRS for the quarter ended June 30, 2020.   9. Regulation 2(1)(n) of PIT Regulations defines \\\\\\\\u201cunpublished price sensitive information\\\\\\\\u201d. The text of the said regulation is reproduced below:  Regulation 2(1)(n) of PIT Regulations:  \\\\\\\\u201cunpublished  price  sensitive  information\\\\\\\\u201d  means  any  information relating  to  a  company or its securities, directly or indirectly, that is not generally available which upon becoming generally available, is likely to materially affect the price of the securities and shall, ordinarily including but not restricted to, information relating to the following: \\\\\\\\u2013  i. financial results; \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026  10. As per Regulation 2(1)(n) of PIT Regulations, \\\\\\\\u201cUnpublished Price Sensitive Information\\\\\\\\u201d means any information which relates directly or indirectly to a Company and which is not generally available and which upon becoming generally available, is likely to materially affect the price of securities of Company. The information relating to financial results of a Company is likely to materially affect the price of securities of the Company upon becoming generally available. This is why there are such extensive Regulations around disclosures of financial results by listed companies. I further note that in the drawing up of financial results of a company, various basic financial parameters like revenue, expenses, write-offs, receivables, loans outstanding etc. are consolidated over a period of time. These parameter in turn depend on various operation parameter like deals signed in the quarter, project completion, staff hired etc. All this information as it gets consolidated, particularly,__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of insider trading in shares of Infosys Limited                                                                                       Page 11 of 55 in the context of comparison with previous quarters, gives as insider a very good understanding of whether the financial results will be positive for the share price of be negative for the share price.  11. Thus, in the present case, I prima facie find that \\\\\\\\u201cthe information relating to the financial results of INFY including basic financial parameters of profit & loss (P&L) and balance sheet (BS) as well as key financial and operational parameters which contribute to various elements of the P&L and BS for the quarter ended June 30, 2020\\\\\\\\u201d was Price Sensitive Information. Further, on account of this information not being generally available until July 15, 2020, it was Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe UPSI\\\\\\\\u201d).   12. Further, it is noted that pursuant to the corporate announcement of financial results for June 2020 quarter on July 15, 2020, the price of INFY rose on July 16, 2020. On NSE trading platform, the price of the scrip was observed to have moved from a closing price of Rs. 830.95 on July 15, 2020 (the day of the corporate announcement post market hours) to a close price of Rs. 911 on July 16, 2020 i.e. a price rise of 9.63% in 1 trading day. A similar trend in price movement was observed on BSE trading platform. Corresponding increase in Nifty Index (which also has INFY as a component) was only 1.15%. Corresponding increase in Sensex (which also has INFY as a component) was only 1.16%.  13. The price movement of INFY at NSE vis-a-vis Nifty during the month of July 2020 is as under:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of insider trading in shares of Infosys Limited                                                                                       Page 12 of 55 Figure No. 1 (price movement of INFY vis-\\\\\\\\xe0-vis Nifty movement)     14. Even though actual price impact because of announcement of financial results is not required for the PIT Regulation to get attracted, however above figure no. 1 shows that pursuant to the USPI being made public on July 15, 2020, there was a sudden rise (impact) in price of INFY scrip from July 15, 2020 to July 16, 2020 that could not be attributed to a general rise in the market (Nifty).  15. As per Regulation 3(5) of PIT Regulations, the Board of Directors of every company shall ensure that a Structured Digital Database (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSDD\\\\\\\\u201d) is maintained containing the names of such persons with whom information under Regulation 3 of PIT Regulations has been shared. Also the names of such persons with whom information is shared under this regulation shall be maintained internally with adequate internal controls and checks such as time stamping and audit trails to ensure non-tampering of the database. 9800 10000 10200 10400 10600 10800 11000 11200 11400 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 NIFTY INFY PRICE (IN RS.)

In this regard, INFY vide email December 22, 2020 had provided an extract of its Structured Digital Database related to the UPSI. Based on the said extract of SDD, it is prima facie found that, the UPSI had come into existence on June 29, 2020. Presently, there is no material available on record which shows otherwise i.e. prima facie there is no material to discredit the assertion of the Company about the timing of existence of UPSI.  17. Further, I find that the UPSI was made public on July 15, 2020 i.e. prima facie, it remained unpublished till July 15, 2020 at 16:21:00. On the basis of above, I prima facie find that the UPSI Period is from June 29, 2020 to July 15, 2020 (16:21:00).   Issue No. 2: Whether Pranshu, Amit and Bharath are insiders in terms of PIT Regulations, 2015? 18. It is pertinent here to refer to the relevant provision / definition of  Connected Person and Insider as mentioned in PIT Regulations, 2015:  18.1. As per Regulation 2(1)(d) of PIT Regulations, \\\\\\\\u201cconnected person\\\\\\\\u201d means,-  (i) any person who is or has during the six months prior to the concerned act been associated  with  a  company,  directly  or   indirectly,  in  any  capacity  including  by reason of frequent communication with its officers or by being in any contractual, fiduciary  or  employment  relationship  or   by  being  a  director,  officer  or  an employee  of  the  company  or  holds  any position  including  a  professional  or business  relationship  between  himself  and  the  company  whether  temporary or permanent,  that  allows  such  person,  directly  or  indirectly, access  to  unpublished price sensitive information or is reasonably expected to allow such access.

Mr. Pranshu Bhutra (Pranshu), Mr. Amit Bhutra (Amit) and Mr. Bharath C Jain (Bharath): 19.1. It is noted that Pranshu is an employee of INFY in the role of Senior Corporate Counsel. Amit and Bharath are partners of Capital One and both were giving trading instruction on behalf of Capital One. Amit is one of the partners of Tesora and was giving trading instruction on behalf of Tesora.   19.2. It is also noted that UPSI period is from June 29, 2020 to July 15, 2020. Capital One traded significantly in INFY from July 10, 2020. Tesora traded significantly in INFY from July 13, 2020. 19.3. Call Data Records (CDRs) and KYC documents of Pranshu, Amit and Bharath were obtained from Telecom providers. From the KYC documents following is noted : Table No. 1 Name of the person Mobile number registered Telecom Provider Validated by the information provided Pranshu / INFY  7619XX8021 Airtel INFY vide email dated 01/02/2021 Pranshu 9886XX1281 Vodafone - Idea KYC documents provided by NSDL Database Management Ltd vide email dated 18/01/2021 Amit 9945XX1667 Airtel KYC documents provided by CDSL Ventures Limited (CVL) vide email dated 15/12/2020 Bharath 9731XX2712 Airtel KYC documents provided by CVL vide email dated 15/12/2020  19.4. From the CDRs of mobile numbers of Pranshu, it is prima facie noted that Pranshu had used mobile number - 9886XX1281 for communicating / speaking with Amit. 19.5.

Pursuant to the interim order, SEBI received submissions dated October 31, 2017 from the company.

Exchange vide letter dated January 03, 2019 informed the company about the appointment of forensic auditor in line with SEBI order dated October 09, 2017 (i.e. date of interim order). In the same letter, the exchange requested the company to provide information to the forensic auditor.    2.7.2. However, the company did not furnish the required information/supporting documents as sought by the forensic auditor.

Based on the above, the SCN alleged that the Noticees had violated provisions of SEBI Act,1992, PFUTP Regulations, 2003, LODR Regulations and SCRA, 1956, as enlisted in para 1 above.  3. The following annexures were provided with the SCN:  Annexure no. Particulars Annexure 1 Interim Order  Annexure 2 Confirmatory Order Annexure 3 Forensic Audit Report  4. The SCN was delivered to the Noticees.  A common reply was received from the Noticees on September 15, 2020 wherein they sought extension of time for filing a reply. The Noticees, except for Noticee no.1, were advised to file reply within October 15, 2020 and the Noticee no. 1 was given time till November 02, 2020 to file its reply. Subsequently, vide email dated October 19, 2020 all the Noticees sought time till November 30, 2020 to file a reply to the SCN. A hearing wasFinal Order in the matter of Tatia Global Vennture Limited        Page 7 of 75   granted to all the Noticees on December 10, 2020 and they were advised to file their reply before the date of hearing. The Noticees submitted their reply vide letter dated December 07, 2020.   5. Vide reply dated December 07, 2020 the Noticees submitted as follows:  5.1. Fraud requires elements of false representation of fact or concealment of what should have been disclosed which deceives and intend to deceive another, investors in securities in this context, so that they may act upon it to their legal injury.  The SCN fails to produce any material to prove that the alleged breach has caused injury to the investors or to the securities market. 5.2. Noticee nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 are non- executive Directors who are not responsible for the day to day running of the Noticee no. 1. The Forensic Audit based on which the present SCN has been issued is for the financial years 2015-2016 to 2017-2018. The allegations made against Noticee nos. 4, 5, 7 and 9 in the SCN regarding violations pertain to land transactions which have taken place during the financial year 2008-2009 when   they   were   not   even   associated with   TGVL.  Further, the investigation by the Forensic Auditor also pertain to the financial years 2015-2016 to 2017-2018. The Noticee nos. 4, 5, 7 and 9 are not in any manner involved in the running of the company and have nothing to do so as far the present case is concerned. 5.3. The Noticee no. 4 was appointed as a non-executive independent- additional director of TGVL with effect from January 20, 2003 and thereafter, his appointment as a non-executive independent director of TGVL was regularized with effect from September 30, 2003 at the Annual General Meeting of TGVL. The   Noticee no. 4 was not involved into the day-to-day affairs of TGVL and did not attend the office of TGVL on a day-to-day basis.Final Order in the matter of Tatia Global Vennture Limited        Page 8 of 75   5.4. The Noticee no. 5 was appointed as a non-executive independent director of TGVL with effect from July 31, 2014 and ceased to be a director of TGVL with effect from October 31,  2016.   5.5. The allegations made against Noticee no. 6 in the SCN regarding violations pertaining to land transactions during the financial year 2008-2009 and the forensic audit during the financial years 2015-2016 to 2017-2018 is nowhere connected to Noticee no. 6 because he was appointed as a Chief Financial Officer of TGVL with effect from August 22, 2014 and ceased to be a Chief Financial officer of TGVL with effect from October 31, 2016. Hence, he was not   associated with TGVL during the alleged transaction investigation period mentioned in the SCN.   5.6. The Noticee no. 7 was appointed as a non-executive independent- additional director of TGVL with effect from October 31, 2016 and thereafter, her appointment as a non-executive independent director of TGVL was regularized with effect   from September 27, 2017 at the Annual General Meeting of TGVL. As a non- executive director, she was not involved in the day to day functioning of the company.  5.7. Noticee no. 9 was appointed as executive non- independent director with effect from May 30, 2018 and ceased to be a director of TGVL with effect from February1, 2019.  5.8. The aforesaid Noticees were never involved in any manner whatsoever in the running of the company and have nothing to do so  as  far  the  present case  is concerned. They are in the nature of- Non- Executive Independent Director with no involvement in day to day operations of the company. They also do not satisfy the conditions of 'officer in default' as prescribed. 5.9. The allegation that an independent forensic auditor was appointed to investigate and   verify the alleged misrepresentation including of financials and/ or business of TGVL and consolidating subsidiaries and alleged misuse of funds/books of accounts of TGVL and consolidating subsidiaries if any is completelyFinal Order in the matter of Tatia Global Vennture Limited        Page 9 of 75   misconceived and misguided. The forensic auditor appointed has submitted its report   for the period between April 2015 to March 2018 based on which the present SCN has been issued. The forensic report   has   failed   to present the true facts and circumstances of TGVL and has resorted to making false, baseless and bald allegations against the Noticees which is completely untenable and bad in law. The appointment of the said independent forensic auditor itself is questionable as there has been no disclosure whatsoever  from   the authorities  regarding the   qualifications/independent nature  of the  said  forensic auditor or the  scope  of their  work in the present investigation. 5.10. The Noticees submit that the SCN has provided no cogent reasons whatsoever to elucidate as to how any of the Noticees have violated   the Regulations in any manner whatsoever. The SCN fails to provide specific instances to show the aforementioned Regulations have been violated and has only sought to make bald, vague and misguided allegations against the Noticees. Pertinently, Regulation 4(1) (a),(b),(c),(e) & (g) relate to the principles governing disclosures and   obligations regarding a listed entity. These   are only general underlying guiding principles that a listed entity is bound to follow and does not invite any penal consequences as such. 5.11. The SCN fails to demonstrate how the company failed to take into account the interest of all stakeholders while preparing the financial statements. No material/ document has been placed on record whatsoever to establish that the standard accounting principles has not been adhered to. It is submitted that the statutory auditors appointed by Noticees were independent, competent and qualified auditors who have ensured that there are no illegalities or non-compliance in the preparation of financial statements. The SCN does not disclose any complaints of misrepresentation to have been received from any investor or stakeholder of the Noticee no. 1 Company to allege that the said Regulation has been violated. There has been no failure or breach in any compliances or mandates prescribed under the law by the Noticees whatsoever.Final Order in the matter of Tatia Global Vennture Limited        Page 10 of 75   5.12. The SCN has failed to establish any particular instance as to how the Board of Directors have failed to discharge their fiduciary duties towards the Noticee 1 Company, its investors and stakeholder and the market. It is further submitted that the integrity of the management has not been compromised and   the all the necessary safeguards prescribed under the law have   been   put   in place   by the -management of Noticees.    5.13. The best interest of Noticees has always been the priority of the management and the members of the board have not failed to exercise due diligence and care. Material proof and   evidence has been provided   to the Forensic Auditor to reflect the same. 5.14. The SCN has failed to establish as to how any of the actions of the Noticees amount to \\\\\\\\u2018fraud\\\\\\\\u2019.  The Supreme Court of India in the case of Securities and Exchange Board of India and Ors v. Kanaiyalal Baldevbhai Patel and Ors. (2017) 15 SCC 753 has categorically held that the element of \\\\\\\\u2018inducement\\\\\\\\u2019 must exist and should be proved before holding that a person is guilty of fraud. 5.15. In the present case that there is no finding that the Noticees  have  indulged   in  any  action  that   has  induced   or misled an investor  or prospective investor  in any manner whatsoever  to trade in the securities of the  Noticee no. 1 Company  and  has  thereby  played a fraud  in the securities market. The SCN has failed to establish as to what action of the Noticees has  alleged  caused any  inducement to  result  in  an  action  of fraud.  Assuming without admitting that the concept of preponderance of probabilities would also apply in the present case, still, it must  be proved  by cogent evidence that  the  Noticees are guilty of \\\\\\\\u2018inducement\\\\\\\\u2019. In the absence, of any evidence, the charge of fraud stands disproved against all the Noticees. 5.16. SCN alleges that the Noticees have resorted  to publishing or causing to publish or report  or caused to report  by a person in securities any information  which is not  true or which he does not  believe to be true  prior  to or in  the  course  of dealing in the  securities in violation of Regulation  4(1)(f). The SCN alsoFinal Order in the matter of Tatia Global Vennture Limited        Page 11 of 75   alleges that the  Noticees are in violation of Regulation  4(1)(r) as  they  have induced  in planting   false  or  misleading   news  which  may  induce   sale   or  purchase  of securities. The SCN has failed to establish or point out as to how any of the Noticees are in violation of the said Regulations  in unequivocal  term. 5.17. The Noticees also submitted detailed response to each allegation in the SCN which is discussed in subsequent paras.  6. On December 10, 2020, the Authorised Representative of the Noticees, along with Shri S.P. Bharat Jain Tatia appeared for hearing in person and made submissions.   Consideration of submissions and findings:  7. I have considered the SCN, replies received, and submissions made by the Noticees during the personal hearing granted to them. The SCN alleges the violation of the following provisions of law by the Noticees:  Relevant extract of the provisions of SEBI Act, 1992:   \\\\\\\\u201cFunctions of Board.  11. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, it shall be the duty of the Board to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market, by such measures as it thinks fit.

SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING:  4. Show Cause Notice dated February 12, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee in terms of Rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules read with Section 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 to show-cause as to why an inquiry should not be    ____________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Goldensight Management Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Sulabh Engineers & Services Limited  Page 3 of 10 initiated and penalty be not imposed under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 on the Noticee for the alleged violation of the Regulations 3(a),(b),(c),(d); 4(1); and 4(2)(a),(b) and (e) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. 5. The SCN inter-alia alleged the following: 5.1 Investigation revealed the following modus operandi used by the Noticee: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The new Promoters of the company i.e., Shri Manoj Kumar Agarwal and Ms. Deepa Mittal acquired 44.30% shares of SESL on February 07, 2011 from the erstwhile Promoters vide a Share Purchase Agreement. Thereafter, the two Acquirers, on February 12, 2011 acquired another 15.83% of paid up capital by way of an Open Offer. In total, the two new Promoters acquired 1,48,850 shares (60.14%) of SESL. Moreover, they also acquired the entire outstanding shares of the company (except for 300 shares) through connected entities and made preferential allotment on March 21, 2011 prior to the start of execution of trades in the scrip on December 1, 2011. Further, shares were allotted on a preferential basis to 46 entities in March,2012.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Further, large number of buy orders were observed in the market (period starting with the date of Public Announcement i.e., from July 09, 2010 to November 30, 2011) from wide set of entities due to positive sentiment created with the Share Purchase Agreement/ Open Offer by the new Promoters and the preferential allotment made by the company. Since the entire free float was held by the connected entities, no sellers came forward to sell despite huge buy orders in the scrip. No trade took place from July 09, 2010 until November 30, 2011.    ____________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Goldensight Management Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Sulabh Engineers & Services Limited  Page 4 of 10 \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The connected entities traded and sold miniscule quantity on 116 trading days (out of 119 trading days during patch 1A) despite holding large number of shares. But for the sell orders of the connected entities, the trades would not have taken place and the price would not have increased as the entire free float was held by these connected entities.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Investigation found that the sell trades of miniscule quantities were carried out by connected entities with an intention of marking the price higher. Further, the investigation concluded that these connected entities wanted to increase the price without increasing the free float, through non-delivery of shares after selling the same on market. Thereafter, the connected entities continued to increase the price of the shares by selling shares during patch 1B. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Investigation has therefore concluded that the company was taken over by the new Promoters with an orchestrated plan of carrying out a scheme of artificially increasing the price of shares of the company and that the company and three of its Directors (including the two new Promoters) were a part of the orchestrated plan since they benefitted by selling substantial value of shares at the manipulated price. 5.2 Investigation revealed that during the investigation period, trading took place on 708 days and the connected entities were observed to have traded on 684 days.  5.3 Patch 1A-Price Rise (December 1, 2011-August 16, 2012) \\\\\\\\uf0b7 During patch 1A, the connected entities entered in 116 trades and all trades except one trade were above LTP. Out of 4,560 shares sold by the 13 connected entities only 3,910 shares were delivered and    ____________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Goldensight Management Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Sulabh Engineers & Services Limited  Page 5 of 10 the delivery of the rest 650 shares (13 trades) were closed out after unsuccessful auctioning.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 During the aforesaid period, investigation revealed that the price moved by `162.65 i.e., from `11.00 to `173.65. Of the said price rise, contribution of `154.2525 i.e., 94.84% of the total positive LTP out of the total rise of `162.65 was through trades where the connected entities were sellers. Investigation concluded that by controlling the supply in the market, selling shares in minimum lot and also defaulting on delivery of shares on several instances, the price of the share of the company was artificially increased by the connected entities. 5.4 Patch 1B \\\\\\\\u2013Price rise (August 17, 2012-February 1, 2013) \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Investigation revealed that the price of the scrip increased from `173.65 to `494.00 i.e, the price increased by `320.35. Investigation found that during this patch, out of 115 days on which the scrip was traded, 21 connected entities sold shares on 89 days. The connected entities together contributed `189.45 to the net price rise of `320.35 (i.e., 59.14%) during this patchand `284.85 of the gross positive LTP variation of `662.05 (i.e., 43.03%). The contribution of the connected entities accounts for more than 50% of market net price movement and therefore it was concluded that the sell trades of these entities resulted in manipulation in the price of the scrip and misleading appearance of trading in the scrip. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Investigation found that 13 connected entities contributed `83.80 to Net LTP on the buy side (out of total `189.45 contributed by the 21 connected entities on the sell side and `320.35 of market LTP) and `112.00 to gross positive LTP (out of total `208.75 contributed by the 21 connected entities on the sell side and a market net LTP of    ____________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Goldensight Management Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Sulabh Engineers & Services Limited  Page 6 of 10 `662.05). The 13 entities were found to have predominantly traded with the 21 connected entities and have contributed significantly to LTP (both Gross and Net). \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Further, based on the significant contribution to Net LTP through trades amongst themselves (21 Sellers and 13 buyers) of `83.80, investigation concluded that these connected entities (21+13-1, common entity=33) artificially increased the price of the scrip. 7.5. 5.5 Patch 2 \\\\\\\\u2013Price rise period post-split in the ratio 10:1 (February 4, 2013-July 22, 2014) \\\\\\\\uf0b7 During the period February 04, 2013 and July 22, 2014, the price of the scrip increased from `49.40 (494 adjusted for 10:1 split) to `243.00 i.e, the net price increase was `193.60.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Investigation revealed that on account of trading during patches1A and 1B, the connected entities sold a net of 1,39,958 shares and therefore 13,95,580 shares (i.e., factoring sub-division of shares) were available with other shareholders (other than the connected entities). In contrast to the trading pattern of the connected entities during patches 1A and 1B where the connected entities predominantly sold shares (on net basis), investigation found that they were net buyers during patch 2 and were observed to be increasing the price of the share by continuously buying shares at a higher price.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 During patch 2, the market Net LTP was `193.60which can be divided into two parts i.e., contribution to net LTP by the 83 connected entities of `636.75 and the negative contribution of Rs. 443.15 by other entities. Investigation concluded that since the market price is a function of net sum of all price variations (both    ____________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Goldensight Management Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Sulabh Engineers & Services Limited  Page 7 of 10 positive and negative), the 83 connected entities had contributed positively to net LTP significantly enough to not only negate the downward drag of `443.15 on the price of the scrip by the other entities in the market but also sufficient to increase the price of the scrip from `49.40 to `243.00. Investigation concluded that considering the fundamentals of SESL which were not supporting the price of the scrip and the trading pattern of trading at prices higher than the LTP, the 83 connected entities traded with an intend to increase the price of the scrip and also resulted in creation/ depiction of artificial demand and interest. 5.6 Investigation revealed that Promoters/ Directors of SESL along with other connected entities and the entities who indulged in manipulation in the scrip were also observed to have benefitted by selling the shares (net sale value was Rs. 50lakh or more) between August 17, 2012 and January 06, 2015. 5.7 In addition to the above, a total of 28 entities were also observed to have benefitted by selling shares of significant value and were connected to aforementioned entities that indulged in manipulation/ other connected entities. Their trading also resulted in false and misleading appearance of trading in the securities market and an act/ practice which operated as a fraud or deceit in the market. 5.8 Based on the above observations, it is alleged that the entire scheme of acquiring SESL by the new Promoters, ensuring least free float of shares prior to the resumption of trading at BSE and using the same for manipulating the price such that the price of the scrip increases multifold and subsequent sale of shares to benefit out of the manipulated price was carried out by the new Promoters and the connected entities in connivance with each other. Further, it is alleged    ____________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Goldensight Management Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Sulabh Engineers & Services Limited  Page 8 of 10 that the trading carried out by these connected entities (including the Noticee) on the exchange platform created false and misleading appearance of trading in the securities market and the same acted as an act/ practice or a course of business which operated as a fraud or deceit in the market. 6. Therefore, it was alleged that Noticee (who was a part of these connected entities) has violated the relevant provisions of Regulations 3(a),(b),(c),(d); 4(1); 4(2)(a),(b) and (e) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. The Noticee was, therefore, called upon to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated and penalty be not imposed under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 on the Noticee for the alleged violation of the aforesaid provisions of PFUTP Regulations 2003. 7. I find that the Show Cause Notice dated February 12, 2018 which was issued to the Noticee had returned undelivered. Subsequently, during the course of the proceedings, the status of the Noticee was ascertained from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (\\\\\\\\u2018MCA\\\\\\\\u2019) website. From the material available on record, I note that, on the MCA website the status of the Noticee (CIN: U51909WB2012PTC184139) is being shown as \\\\\\\\u201cStrike Off\\\\\\\\u201d. In this regard, copy of the Company Master data of the Noticee from the MCA website is placed in the file. Since the status of the Noticee is showing as \\\\\\\\u201cStrike Off\\\\\\\\u201d, it is imperative to see whether the Noticee is existing or not. On perusal of the Form No. STK-7, Notice of Striking Off and Dissolution, dated June 30, 2017, as available in the MCA website, it is noted that the Registrar of Companies, West Bengal, has stated that pursuant to Section 248(5) of the Companies Act, 2013, the Noticee has been struck off the register of companies, and stands \\\\\\\\u201cdissolved\\\\\\\\u201d since June 09, 2017. It is noted from the records that the present SCN in the matter was issued on February 12, 2018. Hence, I note that the Noticee was struck off the register of companies and dissolved on June 09, 2017 i.e. even prior to the initiation of the present adjudication proceedings.    ____________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Goldensight Management Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Sulabh Engineers & Services Limited  Page 9 of 10 8. As evident from the aforesaid, in view of the fact that the Noticee was struck-off under Section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013, even prior to initiation of proceedings in the current matter, it would not be appropriate to determine liability against a company which no longer exists as on date of current proceedings. Hence, the proceedings stand abated without going into the merits of the case. Should the company be revived or restored at any stage, a decision to initiate proceedings may be taken afresh at that stage. 9. In this regard I place reliance on the decision of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (\\\\\\\\u2018ITAT\\\\\\\\u2019) in the matter of M/s. Anujay Hycare Products (P) Ltd. Vs The Income Tax Officer (\\\\\\\\u2018ITAT Delhi\\\\\\\\u2019) Date of Judgement/Order -06/04/2018, in which ITAT observed that \\\\\\\\u201c.......... there could not have been any valid assessment order passed against the assessee-company which was not in existence as on the day of passing of the assessment order because it had already been dissolved. The assessment in the case of non-existing entity is thus nullity. Therefore, A.O. had no jurisdiction to pass the order against the non-existing company.......However, as on today, it is an established fact that assessee-company has already been dissolved and its name is struck-off from the Registrar of Companies. Therefore, it is a non-existing Company and as such, A.O. cannot pass the assessment order under section 143(3) of the I.T. Act, 1961 against the assessee-company. The issue is, therefore, covered in favour of the assessee-company by the above judgments of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court, relied upon by the Learned Counsel for the Assessee.\\\\\\\\u201d. 10. In this context, I would further like to draw reference to a judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) vs Vived Marketing Services (P) Ltd., ITA NO. 273/2009 dated September 17, 2009 in which it was held that - \\\\\\\\u201cWhen the Assessing Officer passed the order of assessment against the respondent company, it had already been dissolved and struck off the register of the Registrar of companies under Section 560 of the Companies Act. In these circumstances, the Tribunal rightly held that there could not have been any    ____________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Goldensight Management Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Sulabh Engineers & Services Limited  Page 10 of 10 assessment order passed against the company which was not in existence as on that date in the eyes of law it had already been dissolved. We are of the opinion that the view taken by the Tribunal is perfectly valid and in accordance with law.\\\\\\\\u201d 11. Therefore, in view of the facts and circumstances noted in the preceding paragraphs and also the fact that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been struck-off from the RoC list and also \\\\\\\\u2018dissolved\\\\\\\\u2019 as on June 09, 2017 as per the RoC notification, I conclude that the present adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee vide SCN dated February 12, 2018 cannot be proceeded with. ORDER 12. In view of my findings noted in the preceding paragraphs and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against Noticee vide SCN dated February 12, 2018, without going into the merits of the case. 13. In terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, a copy of this order is being sent to the Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

Further, Financial Market Authority (FMA) Austria vide email dated March 01, 2016 informed that EURAM Bank has submitted that Vintage was the sole subscriber to GDR issue of Winsome. Hence, GDR issue of Winsome (1.99 million GDRs amounting to USD 13.24 million) was subscribed by only one entity i.e. Vintage.  28. On perusal of the Pledge Agreement and Loan Agreement, it was observed that issuance and subscription of GDRs was done through loan of USD 13.24 million        Adjudication Order in respect of Winsome Yarns Ltd. and Manish Bagrodia in the matter of GDR issue of Winsome Yarns Ltd.  Page 11 of 61 availed by Vintage from EURAM Bank. Further, it was observed that bank account in which GDR proceeds were deposited was in the name of Winsome but the amount deposited in the account was not at the free disposal of Winsome as the same was kept as collateral prior to issuance of GDRs, for the loan availed by Vintage. On examination of Winsome, EURAM Bank retail account statement and Vintage\\\\\\\\u2019s loan account statement it was seen that only after Vintage repaid loan installments, was remaining amount of money transferred from Winsome, EURAM Bank account to Winsome FZE\\\\\\\\u2019s bank account and Winsome, India Bank account.  29. A copy of an extract of board resolution dated September 03, 2010 as provided by EURAM Bank on opening of Bank Account with EURAM Bank, Austria for GDR issue inter-alia states that-  \\\\\\\\u201cRESOLVED THAT a bank account be opened with EURAM Bank (\\\\\\\\u201cthe Bank\\\\\\\\u201d), AG, Palais Esterhazy, Wallnerstrasse 4, A-1010 Vienna, Austria or any branch of Euram Bank, including the Offshore Branch, outside India for the purpose of receiving subscription money in respect of the Global Depository Receipt issue of the Company.\\\\\\\\u201d  RESOLVED FURTHER THAT Mr. Manish Bagrodia, Managing Director of the Company, be and is hereby authorised-  1) to sign, execute, any application, agreement, escrow agreement, document, undertaking, confirmation, declaration and other paper(s) from time to time, as may be required by the Bank and to carry and affix, Common Seal of the Company thereon, if and when so required, and countersigned by Mr. Manish Bagrodia, Managing Director and Mr. K.V. Singhal, General Manager (Legal) & Company Secretary or Mr. Vinod Jaria, Financial Controller of the Company  2) to draw cheques and other documents, and to give instructions from time to time as may be necessary to the said Euram Bank or any branch of Euram Bank, including the Offshore Branch, for the purpose of operation of and dealing        Adjudication Order in respect of Winsome Yarns Ltd. and Manish Bagrodia in the matter of GDR issue of Winsome Yarns Ltd.  Page 12 of 61 with the said bank account and carry out other relevant and necessary transactions and generally to take all such steps to do all such things as may be required from time to time on behalf of the Company,   RESOLVED FURTHER THAT the Bank be and is hereby authorized to use the funds so deposited in the aforesaid bank account as security in connection with loans if any as well as to enter into any Escrow Agreement or similar arrangements if and when so required.\\\\\\\\u201d  30. It is observed from the said board resolution that the Board of Directors of Noticee 1 authorized EURAM Bank to use GDR proceeds of Noticee 1 deposited with EURAM Bank, as security in connection with any loan and also authorized Noticee 2 to sign, execute any application, agreement etc. as and when required by the EURAM Bank. Subsequently, Noticee 2 signed a Pledge Agreement dated March 22, 2011 wherein Noticee 1 pledged its GDR subscription proceeds as collateral against loan availed by Vintage from EURAM Bank.   31. The company\\\\\\\\u2019s authorization to EURAM Bank to use the funds so deposited in the said bank account as security in connection with loan, if any, depicts that the abovementioned board resolution was meant to provide security in connection with loan taken for subscription of GDRs of Winsome.  32. Corporate announcements made by Noticee 1 during the period February 2011-April 2011 were examined and it was observed that Noticee 1 did not inform stock exchange about Pledge Agreement/ collateral security. Pledge Agreement was integral part of Loan Agreement and vice versa and both were executed concurrently. It shows that Noticee 2, being the authorized signatory of Noticee 1, had complete knowledge about the subscriber to GDR issue, as well as source of the funding and had understanding with Vintage for subscription of its GDR issue but the same was not been informed to the shareholders/ investors of Noticee 1.        Adjudication Order in respect of Winsome Yarns Ltd. and Manish Bagrodia in the matter of GDR issue of Winsome Yarns Ltd.  Page 13 of 61 33. Winsome reported to the stock exchange (BSE) on March 29, 2011 that, \\\\\\\\u201cthe Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on March 29, 2011, has allotted 199412500 (Nineteen crores ninety four lacs twelve thousand five hundred) shares of Re. 1/- each in the name of Company's depositary, THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON against 1994125 GDRs.\\\\\\\\u201d, which might have made investors believe that the said GDR issue was genuinely subscribed.   34. Therefore, the entire scheme involving entering into Pledge Agreement, making corporate announcement that the GDRs were successfully subscribed without disclosing the arrangement to the investors. This resulted in publication of misleading news to the stock exchanges which contained information in distorted manner and which might have influenced the decision of the investors. Such announcements misled Indian retail investors and may have induced them to deal in the shares of Winsome. Further, the company has provided false list of initial subscribers to GDR Issue to SEBI. The details of initial subscribers to GDRs as submitted by Winsome to SEBI, vide its letter dated July 06, 2015 is as under: Sl.

For the sake of convenience, the number assigned to each of the Noticee in the Show Cause Notice dated April 5, 2019 has been retained in the present Order.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of trading in the scrip of ECE Industries Limited                                      Page 2 of 62                       BACKGROUND 1) Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) had conducted an investigation into the trading activities in the scrip of ECE Industries Ltd, (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cECE/the Company\\\\\\\\u201d) and the processes of buyback and delisting of its shares carried out by the Company during the Financial Year 2016-17 to ascertain possible violation of the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d), the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations 2003\\\\\\\\u201d), the SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cDelisting Regulations 2009\\\\\\\\u201d) and the SEBI (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cBuyback Regulations 1998\\\\\\\\u201d) during the period from January 01, 2016 to December 30, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cIP\\\\\\\\u201d). The shares of the Company are listed at the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNSE\\\\\\\\u201d) and the Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cMSEI\\\\\\\\u201d). 2) The investigation conducted by SEBI revealed that the promoters of ECE who were acquirers under Delisting Offer viz, the Noticees no. 1 to 7 along with related entities viz, the Noticees no. 8 to 16 participated in a manipulative and fraudulent scheme at various stages, and played a crucial role in creating a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip of ECE to first make the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s Buyback Offer successful and also thereafter, by depressing both the cutoff price under Delisting Offer as well as the market price of the scrip the promoters were helped to sail through their Delisting Offer successfully to the advantage of promoter and promoter related entities. It was noticed that certain entities enjoying connection with the promoters played a crucial role in the aforesaid fraudulent scheme. It was observed that the Noticee no. 8 manipulated the price of the scrip of the Company by repeatedly placing sell orders below available buy order price and in this manner contributed to negative Last Treaded Price (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cLTP\\\\\\\\u201d) in the scrip of the Company through first trades which also resulted in New Low Price (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNLP\\\\\\\\u201d) in the scrip. Further, the Noticee no. 8 along with the Noticees no. 9 and 10 were noticed to be a part of fraudulent scheme to make ECE\\\\\\\\u2019s Buyback Offer successful as well as to depress the cutoff price for the Delisting Offer.  3) Based on the aforesaid findings during the investigation, a common Show Cause Notice dated April 5, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe SCN/Notice\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to the Noticees asking them to show cause as to why suitable directions under sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act should not be issued against them for the violations of the relevant provisions of__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of trading in the scrip of ECE Industries Limited                                      Page 3 of 62                       the SEBI Act, the PFUTP Regulations, 2003, and the Delisting Regulations, 2009 in the scrip of ECE. I note from the records before me that the SCNs were duly served upon the Noticees.  4) I note that the Noticees no. 1, 2, 4 to 8 and 13 had applied for the settlement of the aforesaid proceedings however,  from the records it is observed that the settlement applications filed by the Noticees no. 8 and 13 were rejected on account of non-payment of settlement amount by them but in respect of the Noticees no. 1, 2 and 4 to 7,  the settlement applications have been accepted and after payment of settlement amounts separate settlement orders have been  passed in their favor on April 28, 2020.  Accordingly, the present proceedings are now being adjudicated with respect to the remaining Noticees. 5) The findings of the investigation and allegations made, as contained in the SCN, are narrated in brief here under: (a) The Company came out with Buyback and Delisting Offer for its shares during the year 2016. It was observed that entities connected to promoters of ECE, i.e., the Noticees no. 14 and 15, funded the Noticee no. 11 to purchase shares in ECE, the bulk of which was subsequently sold under the Buyback Offer of the Company and contributed towards making the Buyback Offer successful. It was also found that the Noticee no. 8, who had insignificant holding in the Company, had bought further shares with funding from the entities connected to the promoters of ECE and then sold his shares to make the Buyback Offer successful.  It is alleged that the Noticees no. 3, 8, 11, 14 and 15 were part of a manipulative and fraudulent scheme to make the Buyback Offer of the Company successful. (b) By repeatedly placing sell orders at the same rate within less than 60 seconds of buy orders of ECE, the Noticee no. 11 had created a false or misleading appearance of trading to make the Buyback Offer successful. The Noticee no. 8 indulged in creation of misleading trading in the market and manipulated the scrip price by repeatedly placing sell orders at prices below the available buy order prices and by contributing to NLP and negative LTP through first trades has created false and misleading appearance of trading. (c) The Noticees no. 9 and 10 were the first two bidders in the auction through the reverse book building(\\\\\\\\u201cRBB\\\\\\\\u201d) process conducted for the delisting of shares of ECE. By virtue of funding by entities connected to the promoters of ECE, the Noticees no. 9 and 10 purchased shares of ECE and thereafter, bid large quantities under the Delisting Offer at a price substantially lower than the prevailing market price and thereby contributed towards depressing the cut-off price for the Delisting Offer in a manipulative manner. (d) The Noticees no. 8, 9 and 10 by virtue of offering their shares for sale, which were purchased with funding from promoter related entities, in the RBB process, have created a false or misleading appearance of trading to make the Delisting Offer of ECE successful. Thus,__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of trading in the scrip of ECE Industries Limited                                      Page 4 of 62                       the Noticees no. 8, 9 and 10 alongwith the Noticees no. 12-16 and the Noticee no. 3 found to be part of a fraudulent scheme to depress the cut-off price under the Delisting Offer so as to make the Delisting Offer successful. (e) The promoters of the Company viz, the Noticees no. 1-7 who were acquirers under the Delisting Offer were part of a manipulative and fraudulent scheme wherein entities related to the said promoters funded purchase transactions of the Noticees no. 8 and 11 who subsequently sold under Buyback Offer to make it successful. Further the related entities also funded the purchase transactions of the Noticees no. 9 and 10. Thereafter, the Noticees no. 8, 9, 10 offered their shares near the floor price under Delisting Offer to depress the cut-off price with an intention to make the delisting successful. Further, the Noticee no. 8 also resorted to manipulate the scrip price during this period (i.e. December 21, 2016 to December 30, 2016) causing it to decline, thereby inducing more entities to offer their shares in Delisting Offer. (f) In view of the aforesaid findings, the Noticees no. 1 to 10 are alleged to have violated Sections 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) & 4(2)(a) & (e) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003 and regulations 4(5)(a), (b), (c) of the Delisting Regulations, 2009.

In the absence of any concrete evidence showing a direct or indirect nexus between the Noticees, SEBI has erred in relying on bonafide and independent transactions undertaken by the Noticees as a part of their business activities to conclude that they were connected with each other.  9.4 The statement under paragraph 6 of the SCN stating that the Noticee no. 7 was a Director of the Noticee no. 3 and collectively held 99.75% of the share capital of the Noticee no. 3 along with the Noticee no. 1, is factually incorrect, as it was the Noticee no. 6, who was a director of the Noticee no. 3 during the Investigation Period.                            9.5 There is no evidence to show that the Noticee no. 8 was even aware of or had any knowledge of the fact that the Noticee no. 15 shared another common director with ECE. The Noticee no. 8 had no transactions with the Noticee no. 15, during the Investigation Period. The Noticee no. 8__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of trading in the scrip of ECE Industries Limited                                      Page 6 of 62                       was merely a non-executive Director of Jayantika Vincom and was not involved in the day-to-day affairs of the said company. Further, the SCN neither contains any correspondence/transaction between Mr. Basant Kumar Daga, Mr. Sakate Khaitan and the Noticee no. 8 to show that he was connected to ECE or its promoters or promoter connected entities nor does it contain any averments with respect to Jayantika Vincom or the abovementioned common directors between Jayantika Vincom, the Noticee no. 15 and ECE, i.e. Mr. Sakate Khaitan and Mr. Basant Kumar Daga. Also, no liability has been imputed against Jayantika Vincom, Mr. Basant Kumar Daga or Mr. Sakate Khaitan, either with respect to the trades undertaken by the Noticee no. 8 in ECE shares or the alleged \\\\\\\\u201ctransfer of funds\\\\\\\\u201d to the Noticee no. 8 for making the Buyback Offer or the Delisting Offer successful. 9.6 The Noticee no. 13 is a partnership firm and the Noticee no. 8 (Mr. Mahendra Kumar Agarwala) is one of the partners of the Firm. The Noticee no. 13 had no other connection /relationship with either the Noticee no. 3 or the Noticee no. 14 except for such loan transactions undertaken during the Investigation Period.  9.7 The Noticee no. 15 is only connected to Mr. Sakate Khaitan and the Noticee no. 5 (Pratibha Khaitan ) and neither of these two directors of the Noticee no. 15, which is  connected to ECE, was  involved in its day to day affairs. The Noticee no. 15, being a registered NBFC, used to regularly undertake financial transactions in the form of loans/advances, however, the role of Mr. Sakate Khaitan was limited to that of participating in the policy decisions of the Noticee no. 15. Thus, the allegation that Noticee no. 15 was connected to ECE through its Director, Mr. Sakate Khaitan, is erroneous and incorrect. 9.8 The Noticee no. 5 is a Non-Executive Director of the Noticee no. 15, a citizen of the United Kingdom and has been residing there for the past 20 years. The SCN does not specifically impute any liability on part of the Noticee no. 5 with respect to her role as a Director of the Noticee no. 15 in the alleged financial transactions. In the absence of any concrete evidence to show that Mr. Sakate Khaitan and the Noticee no. 5 were even remotely involved in the alleged \\\\\\\\u201ctransfer of funds\\\\\\\\u201d referred to in the SCN, it cannot be assumed that the Noticee no. 15 was connected to ECE. 9.9 The Noticee no. 9 and the Noticee no. 10 (being NBFC) had sanctioned certain short-term loans in the form of current account transactions to the Noticee no. 12 and such transfers were made pursuant to an overdraft facility sanctioned by ICICI Bank Limited to PH Trading. The Noticee no. 9 had sanctioned such loans to the Noticee no. 12 even prior to the Investigation Period. The Noticees no. 9 and 10 were neither involved nor had any role in the transactions executed between the Noticee no. 12 and other connected entities as referred to in paragraph 6 of the SCN.  9.10 In the absence of either any transactions between the Noticee no. 9 and the Noticee no. 10 with ECE, its promoters or any of its connected entities or any allegation that they had received any__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of trading in the scrip of ECE Industries Limited                                      Page 7 of 62                       funds from ECE's promoters or connected entities, the allegation that they were connected to ECE and its promoters based on the funds received from the Noticee no. 12, is erroneous and unjustified. 9.11 The Noticee no. 12 had received loans from the Noticees no. 3, 14, 15 and 16 as evident from its loan documents, financial ledger and bank account statements reflecting the receipt of such loans. It is important to state that the transactions referred to in paragraph 6 of the SCN, in fact, merely refer to the loan transactions executed by the Noticee no. 12 with such entities which were solely undertaken for business purposes and were nowhere connected to either ECE or the Delisting Offer. It is submitted that except for the above financial transactions, the Noticee no. 12 had no other connection/relationship with the above-referred four entities. 9.12 At the time of executing such loans, the Noticee no. 12 was not aware of any connection that may have existed between such entities and ECE. Further, the SCN neither refers to any transactions between the Noticee no. 12 and ECE, nor does it refer to any correspondence or interaction between the Noticee no. 12 and ECE or its promoters to suggest that the Noticee no. 12 had colluded with the promoters of ECE to make the Delisting Offer successful by funding the Noticees no. 9 and 10.  9.13 As a registered NBFC, the Noticee no. 11 had executed financial transactions in the nature of loans/short-term inter-corporate deposits with several entities, including with AUM Capital Market Pvt. Ltd. as well as with the Noticees no. 14 and 15 however, interest on such loans and advances was charged /paid at the prevailing market rates during the Investigation Period. The Noticee no. 11 had received loans from both the Noticees no. 14 and 15 even prior to the Investigation Period. At the time of entering into such transactions, the Noticee no. 11 had no knowledge of any alleged connection between such entities or their connection with ECE or its promoters. 9.14 Apart from the transaction between the Noticee no. 11 and the Noticee no. 15 as alleged in Annexure 3.1 of the SCN, there is no other evidence to establish a connection between the Noticee no. 11 and ECE or its promoters, hence, the allegation that the Noticee no. 11 is connected to ECE, based on documents enclosed in Annexure 3.1 to the SCN, is wholly unjustified and incorrect.  II. The financial transactions executed by the Noticees were bonafide independent transactions and were not connected to or to make Buyback /Delisting Offer successful 9.15 The Noticees had no role either in the Buyback Offer or any other transaction allegedly connected to the Buyback Offer. The patterns of transfer of funds by the Noticees as referred to in the SCN are based on false assumptions and are incorrect to the extent that bonafide independent transactions have been selectively extracted and correlated to allege that the Noticees had participated in a fraudulent scheme to make the Buyback/Delisting Offer__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of trading in the scrip of ECE Industries Limited                                      Page 8 of 62                       successful. Merely because the Noticees had advanced loans to certain entities mentioned in the SCN, it cannot be assumed that the Noticees were aware of all transactions undertaken by such entities and were involved in an alleged fraudulent scheme. The SCN does not allege the existence of any connection/correspondence between the Noticees no. 8 to 6 except for the financial transactions referred to in the SCN to show that the funds transferred among them were for the purpose of funding the purchase of shares of ECE.   9.16 Prior to the Delisting Offer, the Noticee no. 3 held merely 3.51% of the equity share capital/voting rights in ECE as the promoter of ECE and did not participate in the day to day affairs of ECE. Its involvement was limited to its role as a person acting in concert in the Delisting Offer, similar to that of any other acquiring-shareholder in case of delisting of listed companies. Further, the SCN does not refer to any evidence to show that the Noticee no. 3 was involved, even in its capacity as the promoter of ECE, in any fraudulent scheme with respect to the Buyback Offer or the Delisting Offer. 9.17 The Noticee no. 3 had provided a loan of INR 76,00,000 to the Noticee no. 13 in six tranches (on May 13, May 21, June 15, June 17, July 08, and August 08, 2016) and the Noticee no. 13 repaid that amount to the Noticee no. 3 through part payments on August 31, September 09, September 14, 2016 and January 10, 2017, and interest was also charged in respect of such loan. Though the total amount advanced by the Noticee no. 3 to Noticee no. 13, as per the SCN, is INR 58,00,000 whereas an amount of INR 76,00,000 (which was the actual loan amount advanced by the Noticee no. 3 to the Noticee no. 13 during the Investigation Period) is alleged to have been transferred by the Noticee no. 13 to the Noticee no. 3 pursuant to a sale of ECE shares by the Noticee no. 8. It is submitted that no explanation has been provided in the SCN, regarding the difference in amounts paid and received by the Noticee no. 3 from the Noticee no. 13. 9.18 As per request made on September 26, 2016, the Noticee no. 3 paid an amount of INR 29 Lakh to the Noticee no. 12 in two tranches i.e., September 28 and September 29, 2016 and the Noticee no. 12 repaid an amount of INR 29.73 Lakh to the Noticee no. 3 along with interest of INR 82,055 (before TDS) on January 09, 2017. Except for the abovementioned financial transaction, the Noticee no. 3 had no other relationship/ connection with the Noticee no. 12. In the absence of any evidence to show that the Noticee no. 3 had any knowledge of either the payments made by the Noticee no. 12 to the Noticees no. 9 and 10 or about the trades undertaken by them in the Delisting Offer, the allegation in the SCN that the Noticee no. 3 had participated in a fraudulent scheme by funding the Noticees no. 9 and 10 to make the Delisting Offer successful, is unjustified. The allegation that the Noticee no. 3 has funded inter alia the Noticee no. 8 has been made without analyzing the specific nature of the transactions undertaken by the Noticee no. 3 with such entities.  9.19 The trades of the Noticee no. 8 were not merely restricted to Buyback Period as the Noticee no. 8 had acquired around 1048 shares of ECE through off-market transactions after the__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of trading in the scrip of ECE Industries Limited                                      Page 9 of 62                       closure of the Buyback Period, i.e. on August 09, 2016. The funds received by the Noticee no. 8 from the Noticee no. 13 were pursuant to capital introduction/capital withdrawal, which had no nexus with the financial transactions between the Noticee no. 13 and or other entity  and the trades undertaken by the Noticee no. 8  were as a part of his usual trading activity. 9.20 The SCN fails to establish that the Noticee no. 8 had traded in the shares of ECE only pursuant to and with the monies received from the Noticees no. 3 and 14 through the Noticee no. 13. During the relevant period the Noticee no. 8 had executed multiple trades in ECE shares with the Noticee no. 13 and with AUM Capital Pvt. Ltd. during the Buyback Period and thereafter, on dates other than those mentioned in the SCN.   9.21 As per the SCN, the payments were received by the Noticee no. 8 since June 15, 2016 while the Noticee no. 8 had been making payments to the AUM Capital Pvt. Ltd. for purchase of ECE shares even prior to the said date viz., on May 27, May 30, June 03, June 06, June 09-10 and June 13-14, 2016. It is evident that the Noticee no. 8 purchased shares of ECE even prior to the receipt of the alleged funds from the Noticees no. 3 and 14 through the Noticee no. 13.  9.22 When the Noticee no. 8 had tendered its 32,979 (7.54%) shares on the last day of the Buyback Period, ECE had already received more than 50% of the shares required for the Buyback Offer to be successful and therefore, the Noticee no. 8\\\\\\\\u2019s trades in ECE on June 24, 2016 were not relevant for the purpose of making the Buyback Offer successful.  9.23 The Noticee no. 8 had attempted to sell his shareholding at a price above INR 170 per share through several trades in ECE shares between June 01, 2016 and June 23, 2016, however, owing to a lack of trading volume, he was unable to sell a large number of shares at a share price of beyond INR 170.  Therefore, on June 24, 2016, the Noticee no. 8 placed his sell orders at a share price of close to INR 170 on account of a lack of trading volume, and not to create a false or misleading appearance of trading, as alleged in the SCN. The Noticee no. 8 had merely instructed its stock broker to place the orders on June 24, 2016 when the markets opened. Hence, all the trades were entered at around 9:15 a.m. on June 24, 2016 and it was a mere coincidence that ECE had placed its buy orders at the same time.  9.24 Owing to a lack of trading volume, the Noticee no. 8 could sell only around 3232 shares between December 21-30, 2016. Therefore, the Noticee no. 8 offered his shares for sale in the delisting process at a rate closer to the floor price of the Delisting Offer, i.e., INR 203 on the last day of the Delisting Offer in order to get the best price for his shares to ensure successful divestment of his holdings, to ensure that his offer was accepted and such an act of offering shares at a price closer to the floor price was not done in an attempt to artificially depress the cut-off price.  9.25 The Noticee no. 8 had, in fact, attempted to place sell orders at higher prices, but due to lack of trading volume, such orders were not accepted. Therefore, the Noticee no. 8 placed sell orders below best available prices to ensure that that his offers were accepted in total, and not with a__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of trading in the scrip of ECE Industries Limited                                      Page 10 of 62                       view to manipulate the scrip price of ECE. The SCN has merely taken into consideration that the orders were placed by the Noticee no. 8 below buy order prices, without appreciating the order quantity placed by the Noticee no. 8 and the demand for such shares in the market. Thus, the SCN has not only incorrectly stated that the sell order quantity of the Noticee no. 8 was less than the buy order demand available at his order price, but also has failed to appreciate that only around 70% of his sell order quantity in the said transaction, was actually bought at a price less than the best available buy price referred to in the SCN. Out of the 208 gross trades undertaken by the Noticee no. 8 during the period as a seller, more than 60% of the trades were undertaken at LTP or above the LTP. Further, out of 23,459 shares that contributed towards the total market negative LTP, the number of shares sold by the Noticee no. 8 at negative LTP constituted merely 5.1%. Therefore, the allegation that the Noticee no. 8 has manipulated the scrip price of ECE is unjustified. In this regard, the Noticee no. 8 has highlighted the decision of SAT in Ketan Parekh v. SEBI (Appeal No. 2 of 2005, decided on July 14, 2006) and SPJ Stock Brokers Private Limited v. SEBI (Appeal No. 52 of 2013, decided on September 04, 2013) to submit that there is no connection between the Noticee no. 8 and the counterparties as alleged and none of the facts set out in the SCN points towards any manipulative, fraudulent or deceptive conduct on part of the Noticee no. 8.  9.26 The Noticee no. 8 had merely tendered around 17,695 (1% of the total shares tendered) ECE shares and the same was insignificant to make the Delisting Offer successful or to depress the cut-off price, especially when a substantial number of shares were sold by the Noticee no. 8 on the last day of the Delisting Offer, i.e. on December 30, 2016.  9.27 As a partner of the firm, it was usual for the Noticee no. 8 to withdraw / introduce capital into the firm and the transactions referred to in the SCN were not an one-off event. Contrary to the allegations in the SCN, it is submitted that such transactions were neither connected to the trades undertaken by the Noticee no. 8 in ECE shares, nor had any nexus with any other financial transaction that the Noticee no. 13 may have with any other entity; 9.28 The Noticee no. 8 had no personal involvement in the alleged transfer of funds between the Noticee no. 13 and any other entity. In fact, the SCN also does not refer to any correspondence/ communication between the Noticee no. 8 and the Noticees no. 3/14 to show that the funds transferred by the Noticee no. 13 to him were intended for the purpose of buying ECE shares. Therefore, the SCN has incorrectly assumed that the payments received by the Noticee no. 8 from the Noticee no. 13 were made out of the funds received by the Noticee no. 13 from other entities, in order to purchase ECE shares, for the purpose of making the Delisting Offer successful. 9.29 The Noticee no. 8 undertook frequent transactions with the AUM Capital Pvt. Ltd. and with the Noticee no. 13, as a partner of the firm, even on the dates other than those mentioned in the SCN.  Therefore, the SCN has erroneously alleged that the payments received from the Noticee__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of trading in the scrip of ECE Industries Limited                                      Page 11 of 62                       no. 13 were made out of funds received by the Noticee no. 13 from other entities. For instance, the Noticee no. 8 had also received multiple payments from the Noticee no. 13 on February 11, 2016, March 08, 2016, August 09, 2016 and December 27, 2016. Similarly, the Noticee no. 8 had multiple financial transactions with the AUM Capital Pvt.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), pursuant to receipt of information regarding issuance of equity shares by BRD Securities Limited (BRD / the Company), an RBI registered Non-banking Financial Company (NBFC), conducted examination in the matter to ascertain the possible___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 2 of 27 violations of various laws pertaining to public issue of securities. On examination of various documents including information from the Registrar of Companies (RoC) database and submissions made by the Company, it was inter alia observed that the Company had made equity allotments since Financial Year 2000-01 onwards on various occasions. The details of the said equity share allotments (excluding instances of bonus issue and rights issue and issues made to less than 49 persons) are as follows:  Date of board resolution* Date of allotment No. of allottees No. of shares  Share premium   Amount raised (nominal) 6-10-2001 06-10-2001 246 196000 - 1960000 28-10-2004 28-10-2004 283 578700` - 5787000 22-6-2005 22-6-2005 294 1119200 - 11192000 13-10-2005 13-10-2005 311 676100  6761000 23-8-2007 23-8-2007 425 1113500  11135000 25-9-2008 25-8-2008 487 1527600  15276000 14-1-2010 14-1-2010 579 1497795     29955900 14977950 25-11-2010 25-11-2010 909 3044423 1522221150 30444230 Total  3534  182177050 97533180  2. It was further observed that each of the Board Resolutions passed by BRD in respect of the abovementioned issues, as noted from the Annual Reports of BRD, contained a clause regarding allotment of \\\\\\\\u201cequity shares to any person including existing members of the company, in any manner the board may deem fit.\\\\\\\\u201d  3. Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956 provides that no offer or invitation for subscribing to shares shall be treated as made to the public if the offer or invitation can properly be regarded, in all the circumstances - (a) as not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 3 of 27 available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation; or (b) otherwise as being a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer or invitation. However, the first proviso in Section 67(3) provides that nothing contained in this sub-section shall apply in a case where the offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or debentures is made to fifty persons or more. Even further, the second proviso in Section 67(3) provides that nothing contained in the first proviso shall apply to the non-banking financial companies or public financial institutions specified in section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956.   4. The Company in its submissions to SEBI had claimed inter alia that the second proviso to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956 exempts NBFCs from the first proviso, and therefore invitation to 50 or more persons by NBFC would not be deemed to be a public issue. However, it was noted by SEBI that the abovementioned second proviso of Section 67(3) was not a blanket rule and the Company still needed to prove that it had an intention to offer the securities only to those persons who received the offer or the issue was a domestic concern of the Company. The Company had allegedly failed to do so.   5. In view of the above,  it was observed that since the Company made allotment of equity shares to a total of 3534 persons on 8 instances from October 06, 2001 to November 25, 2010, there was an obligation to file prospectus in connection with the issue of securities and comply with provisions of Sections 56(1), 56(3), 60(1), 73(1), 73(2) and 73(3) read with Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956 and Section 456(2) of the Companies Act, 2013; Clauses 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 5.3.1, 2.1.1, 5.6.2, 2.2, 4.14.11, 4.14, 8.8.1, 5.6A, 8.6.1, 6.0 to 6.33 and 5.12 of the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000; Regulation 4(2)(d) & (e), 5 (1), (2), (5) & (7), 6(1), 7, 26(1), (2) & (6), 32(1), 36, 37, 46(1), 47(1), 49(1), 57(1), 58(1) & (2) and 63 of the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (ICDR 2009) read with Regulation 301 of the SEBI  (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements)___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 4 of 27 Regulations, 2018 (ICDR 2018). It was alleged that the Company had failed to do so.   6. Accordingly, a Show Cause Notice dated April 05, 2019 read with Supplementary Show Cause Notice dated December 12, 2019 (together referred to as the \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Company (Noticee no. 1) and 11 persons, named at serial nos. 2 to 12 in the Table on page 1 of this order (Noticee nos. 2 to 12), who were directors of BRD during the relevant time and as such were responsible for the affairs of the Company, for the abovementioned alleged violations, calling upon them to show cause as to why appropriate directions should not be issued against the Noticees, including but not limited to the following: (a) Directions against Noticee nos. 1 to 12 for refund of all subscription money in terms of Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956. (b) To restrain Noticee no. 1 / BRD from issuing any further securities and from accessing the capital market for a period as deemed appropriate. (c) To restrain Noticee nos 2 to 12 from accessing the capital market for a period as deemed appropriate.  7. The Noticees replied to the SCN vide letters dated May 09, 2019 and October 26, 2010. Subsequently, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticees by scheduling the same on February 26, 2020. In the meantime, BRD filed a writ petition before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court of Kerala, challenging the initiation of instant proceedings by SEBI against the Company and praying for a declaration that the SCN issued by SEBI was ultra vires the provisions of the Companies Act and the SEBI Act, 1992. Pursuant to the same, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court vide its order dated February 24, 2020 stayed the passing of final order by SEBI in the instant matter for a month. However, the Court directed that the scheduled hearing would go on.___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 5 of 27  8. Accordingly, the personal hearing took place on February 26, 2020 which was attended by the Noticees. In the meantime, various investor complaints were received by SEBI against BRD in respect of equity shares issued by it, about which the Company was informed during the personal hearing. Subsequently, vide various orders the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court extended the bar on passing of final order by SEBI on several occasins. Finally, vide order dated February 25, 2021, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court dismissed the said writ petition by observing that the same lacked merit. The said order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court was appealed against by the Company before a two-judge bench of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court. However, the said appeal was dismissed by the two-judge bench vide an order dated March 08, 2021 whereby the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court directed SEBI to serve copies of all material, complaints, documents, etc. relied upon to the Company within two weeks from the date of receipt of the order copy. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court further directed that the appellant (BRD) would be at liberty to file its detailed objections, if any, within a week thereafter, and that the proceedings be finalised within a period of two months from the date of receipt of the order copy after providing hearing to the appellant. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Court made it clear that the findings against the appellant made in the order of the Learned Single Judge would stand vacated, and that the appellant would be at liberty to take out all material contentions in the proceedings.  9. Consequent to the above order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court, the Noticees were provided with copies of all the relevant material vide email dated March 24, 2021. Subsequently, they were granted an opportunity of personal hearing on May 07, 2021 which was attended by Shri PR Ramesh, Advocate, on behalf of the Noticees. The Noticees were granted time till May 14, 2021 to file their written submissions, which they did vide email dated May 14, 2021.  10. The Noticees vide letters dated May 09, 2019; October 26, 2010 and May 14, 2021 have submitted inter alia the following:___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 6 of 27  (a) The Company denies the allegation that it has contravened Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956. Merely because the allotment has been made to more than 49 persons, it does not mean there is a contravention of law. (b) As per Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956, an issue can be termed as an issue emanating from an offer made to members of public, only if the offer is not intended to be made to persons being the domestic concern of the Company that makes the offer. Secondly, every offer of shares to more than 49 persons, ipso facto, cannot be deemed to be a public issue falling outside the permitted circle of Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956. (c) The definition of public issue as per guideline no. 1.2.1 (xxii) of the SEBI DIP 2000 means an invitation by a company to public to subscribe to the securities offered through a prospectus. These guidelines did not refer to making an offer or invitation to persons more than 50 as provided in Section 67. Since the Company had never intended to invite public for subscription or issue a document in the form of a prospectus, these guidelines would not apply to the past issues of equity shares. Further, no amendment was brought to the definition of public issue until the year 2008, till when the guidelines were in force. (d) Under Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956, there is no provision which specifies a period of time within which a company cannot make a subsequent offer. In simple words, Section 67 does not introduce a minimum mandatory time gap between one issue and another. (e) Decision of the Supreme Court cannot be applied to every case. Each case turns out on facts. There is nothing under Section 67(3) which suggests that every case where issue has been made to more than 49 persons would be ipso facto a public issue, especially because the company is an NBFC. (f) The Company has provided applications for shares to only those to whom the offer or invitation was made and clause 14 of the application form specifies that the offer of that particular application form is to such persons___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 7 of 27 to whom that form is sent and not to any other person which would have resulted in a public offer. The application form issued by the Company also contained a printed text stating \\\\\\\\u201cprivate placement application form\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cform for private circulation only\\\\\\\\u201d. (g) An offer or invitation can be said to have been made to members of the general public only if the offer or invitation lands in the hands of persons whose particulars are not known to the Company at all until the time when a subscription is made by that person. No such offer or invitation to public was made at any point by the Company and there was no intention to do so nor to get the shares listed in the stock exchanges in order to say that it is a company that intended to get its securities listed. No advertisement or paper notice or circulation of any form of notices or bills was made by the Company at any point of time. (h) The Company is neither a listed company nor has intended or promised any of its investors on its intentions to get its securities listed and hence does not come under the ambit of companies administered by SEBI. Thus, SEBI has no jurisdiction to issue the SCN. (i) The action by SEBI in this matter is time barred. (j) In respect of each of the allotments referred to in the SCN, the Company had filed the requisite return of allotment, issued share certificates, made entries in register of members, called and held extra-ordinary general meetings and AGMs by issuing proper notices, paid dividends, corresponded with shareholders, carried out transfers and transmissions and other requirements of shareholders, transferred unclaimed dividend to IPEF and filed audited financial statements with RoC and RBI. In the public domain, all this information was residing ever since the return of allotment was filed under Section 75 of the Companies Act, 1956. Therefore, it is clear case of action barred by limitation, even assuming that SEBI has jurisdiction over the subject matter.___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 8 of 27 (k) The offer and allotment of shares is a contract between the parties, even if it is assumed that the contract is void ab initio, the provisions of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 will apply. All the shareholders have acted as shareholders for period of 10 to 20 years and they have received benefits of dividends declared and paid by the Company from time to time. Therefore, dehors the legal position, any direction to repay all the money with interest is wholly untenable. (l) The company is calling and holding shareholders meeting properly and regularly, paying dividends to shareholders. There have been no investor complaints. There has been no fraud. All records, registers and returns are available for inspection. Whatever information has been called for has been provided. It is unreasonably disproportionate to require the Company to return all the monies raised through those allotments with interest. (m)The RBI circular no. DNBD(PD)CC no. 330/03.10.001/2012-13 dated June 27, 2013 for the first time specified that an offer to more than 49 persons will be construed as a public issue. Therefore, all issuances of shares made until June 2013 are not covered by the 49 persons norms and hence there is no violation in the issue of equity shares. (n) The Noticee submits a copy of the Application Form with proper printing, indicating that the issues were on private placement basis. Further, on point as to whether the issues were made only to persons who received the offer, the Company submits full list of share allottees and how they were already related to the Company, thereby satisfying that it was a domestic concern of the Company. (o) Leaving aside the above contentions, the Company is ready to offer a scheme of arrangement by which an exit window could be granted to the existing shareholders through personalized communication to the respective shareholders in the manner in which notices of General Meetings are issued to shareholders and also by public advertisement whereby fair price for the shares arrived at by a registered valuer can be given to those___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 9 of 27 shareholders who come forward and surrender their shares within a specified period of time from the date of issuance of notice. (p) BRD Securities Ltd. was incorporated on March 09, 1993 in the State of Kerala as a finance company and is based in Thrissur district of Kerala State.  It obtained a Certificate of registration dated 28.11.1998, from the RBI to carry on business of NBFC and is a non-deposit taking NBFC. It is engaged in the business of lending to small business, giving loans etc. It has about 32000 customers and loan and advances of Rs. 141.10 crores as of date. The paid-up share capital as of date is Rs. 31.32 crores and borrowing by way of debentures, sub-ordinate debt etc. is about Rs. 104.62 crores. (q) The Company is well known in the local financial markets and has been one of the stable small sized NBFC in the area.  It raised share capital from time to time from promoters, directors and their friends and relatives. It has always approached current shareholders, friends and relatives of promoters / directors, for capital and has never approached the public or made a public issue of shares. That all the applicants are known to the promoters / directors / company is also evident from the postal addresses of the shareholders, as they are all based in Thrissur.  It is also submitted that the SEBI DIP Guidelines treat contributions from promoters, directors, and their friends and relatives as part of promoters\\\\\\\\u2019 contribution. Reliance is placed on clause 4.9.4 of the DIP Guidelines in this regard. By the year 2001, the company had about 240 shareholders who were all friends and relatives of the promoters and directors. The impugned SCN deals with the private placement issues made from October 2001 onwards till 2010 and not the capital raised prior to this period. Each of the private placement issues was approved by the shareholders at the relevant general body meeting pursuant to special resolution passed under Section 81(1A) of the Companies Act, 1956. Sub section (1) of Section 81 provides for issue of further share capital to the existing shareholders i.e a Rights Issue. This is the right of pre-emption in that the existing shareholders have a right to___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 10 of 27 subscribe to additional new shares. However, if three fourths of the existing shareholders agree by special resolution, this right of pre-emption is waived and the new shares can be issued to any other person. Sub Section (1A) of Section 81 provides for such further issue of shares to persons other than current shareholders if a special resolution is passed at the General meeting of the company. (r) When a further issue of shares is made to \\\\\\\\u2018any persons\\\\\\\\u2019, it does not necessarily make it a public issue. It could be a public issue or a private placement because the shares are offered to persons other than the current shareholders. Therefore, even in the case of a private placement, since it involves further issue of shares to other than current shareholders, even if it may be a few new shareholders, the resolution has to refer to \\\\\\\\u2018other persons\\\\\\\\u2019 as required by law. Therefore, the issues referred to in the impugned SCN do not become public issues merely because the special resolution has been passed by the general body of the Noticee, under Section 81(1A) referring to \\\\\\\\u2018any person\\\\\\\\u2019.  (s) The impugned SCN alleges that the Noticee had made equity share allotments since financial year 2000 on various occasions, as per the ROC records / company submissions. The Noticee submits that while each of the issues on private placement is distinct having different dates of allotments, the impugned SCN has attempted to portray an erroneous picture by alleging that \\\\\\\\u201cthe company made allotment of equity shares to total of 3534 persons on 8 instances from October 6 2001 to November 23, 2010, hence there was an obligation to file prospectus in connection with the issue of securities\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d The impugned SCN fails to state if each of the private placement issue is an alleged contravention and in the absence of such a charge, how the impugned SCN can propose to issue a direction to refund the proceeds pursuant to Section 73 of the Companies Act. The provisions of Section 73 of the Companies Act apply to each issue of shares separately and assuming there is a violation, the refund envisaged in Section 73(2) has___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 11 of 27 to be ordered for each issue separately and cannot be clubbed, as stated in the impugned SCN. (t) The impugned SCN while listing out the various private placement issues has proposed action and directions against the 11 (eleven) Directors on the Board of directors of the Noticee. In this regard, it is submitted that one of the Directors, Mr. Arimpilly Vishnu Bhattathirippad (Noticee 11) has passed away on 20-1-2017 and another director, Mr.Jojo Njezhuvinkel Joseph (Noticee 10) was appointed as a Director on 23-6-2016, i.e. after the said issuances. Further, Mr. Surendran Thazhathpurakkal Krishnan (Noticee 2) was appointed as a director on 23-3-2006. It is submitted that the proposed directions, if any, against Mr. Arimpilly Vishnu Bhattathirippad (Noticee 11) may please be dropped. Further, since Mr. Jojo Njezhuvinkel Joseph (Noticee 10) was not on the Board of directors of the Company during the relevant period of alleged violations from 2001 to 2010, but was appointed on 23-6-2016, the directions contemplated against him may also be dropped. As regards Mr. Surendran T Krishnan (Noticee 2), since he was not on the Board of directors of Noticee during the issues made from 2001 to March 2006, and was appointed as a director on 23-3-2006, any actions contemplated against him for the prior period may be dropped. Sub section (2) of Section 73 casts an obligation on the company and every director of the company who is an officer in default to jointly and severally repay the money with interest as prescribed, and therefore such obligation is on the relevant directors who were responsible for the issue, if such issue was in contravention of Section 73. Therefore, the liability, if any, is on the relevant directors at that time and not the other directors. (u) As regards the proposed action of restraint on the Company and the directors, as mentioned under para 15 (b) and (c) of the SCN, it is not stated therein as to the provisions of law under which the said directions are proposed to be issued. Further, the exact quantum of restraint from accessing the capital market is not indicated. In this respect, the SCN is vague. It is trite law that a show cause notice must tell the Noticee the legal___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 12 of 27 provisions under which the penalties / directions are proposed and the specific penalty / restraint must be indicated. In this regard, the Noticee refers to the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of Gorkha Security Services v. Govt of NCLT of Delhi & Ors [2014(9)SCC105]. (v) The impugned SCN has been issued belatedly, after almost 18 years after the first issue of private placement was made in 2001. Even the last issue of the private placement was made in 2010 i.e. about 9 years before the issue of the impugned SCN. The very fact that the impugned SCN was issued 19/10 years after the event has rendered it impossible to look for old registers sought by SEBI to defend the proceedings. The SEBI Act does not contain any provisions on the time within which SEBI is required to initiate any action for alleged contraventions of the provisions of the Act.  However, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme court in various cases has held that in the absence of any period of limitation, the authority is required to exercise its powers within a reasonable period. (w) The Noticee submits that the substantial delay in starting an investigation and issuing the impugned SCN is prejudicial to the Noticee. During the last 20 years, the funds raised from the private placements have been utilized in the legitimate business of the company and the Noticee has scrupulously complied with all the compliances and rules under the Companies Act, 1956 as applicable then. The Noticee was inspected by its regulatory authority viz. RBI many times during the last 20 years. It has deployed the funds towards lending activities and currently there are about 32000 borrowers.   The shares have been transferred amongst various persons, as permitted under the provisions of the Companies Act, and thus, third party rights have also been created. The proposed directions, including the direction to refund all the subscription money in terms of Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956, are untenable merely on the ground of unreasonable delay and laches in initiating the inquiry and proceedings.    (x) The Companies Act prescribes various records and documents to be maintained, some of which are permanent records and some are to be___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 13 of 27 maintained for specific period of time of 5/8 years.  The records sought by SEBI pertaining to the private placements which are in the nature of permanent and statutory records have been made available to the Regional office Kochi of SEBI and are available at any time. Such records that are available include the application forms, details of the applicants, the board minutes / resolutions for allotment, share transfer registers, the minutes of the general body meetings, allotment forms filed with the ROC, the annual returns etc. But the Noticee is unable to ascertain whether any other records which are registers and documents not prescribed under law, or required to be kept mandatorily are available due to lapse of time and shifting of offices during the last 20 years, change of personnel handling the records etc.  However, some computer records were maintained based on which the submissions have been made. The unreasonable delay in initiating the proceedings deprives the Noticee of its right to defend adequately and actions if any, that SEBI may take on the grounds inter alia of non-production of records and/or, ignoring the unreasonable delay and laches in initiating the proceedings would be highly prejudicial to the Noticees.  (y) The Noticee submits that neither Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956 nor the provisions of the SEBI DIP Guidelines or the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations stipulate any records to be maintained or procedure to be followed for private placements. The details of the records to be maintained for private placements have been introduced subsequently in Section 42(7) of the Companies Act, 2013. Therefore, any adverse finding that certain records are not made available will be highly erroneous particularly when no procedure is prescribed and there was no stipulation as to maintenance of records, during the period covered in the impugned SCN. (z) The Noticee submits that each of the Issues referred in the impugned SCN is a legally made pure private placement issue. The Noticee is an NBFC registered with RBI. Therefore, by virtue of the second proviso to sub section (3) of Section 67, the stipulation that a private placement cannot exceed 49 persons does not apply to the issues that are the subject matter___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 14 of 27 of the impugned SCN. The impugned SCN itself states that in case of NBFCs, the second proviso to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, is not a blanket rule and the Noticee needs to prove that it had an intention to offer the securities only to those persons who received the offer or that the issue was a domestic concern to the company. In this regard, the Noticee submits as follows: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It has not issued any circular, advertisement, Information memorandum, offer letter or any prospectus or any material of any nature for any of the issues; nor is there any such allegation in the impugned SCN. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 During the relevant period i.e. 20 years ago to 10 years ago, there was no procedure prescribed or statutory record stipulated for private placement issues, either under Companies Act or the DIP Guidelines,  except that the Noticee had to follow the provisions of Section 67 (3) and comply with the filing requirements under the Companies Act, 1956, such as Form 2 for allotments, Annual returns etc.    \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It strictly adhered to the stipulation that no application was directly or indirectly available to any person other than to whom the application was given. Being a company based in a small local community, the promoters and directors knew every shareholder and his / her family. The company has maintained computer records for every issue, wherein each application was mapped with the promoter / director who knew the applicant and such promoter / director obtained the application from the applicant. At that time, the Noticee followed the process of giving the application with the name written to the person and obtained it back from him. It was thus ensured that the application was not circulated to others. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The Noticee is able to map every applicant, his/her address and how the applicant is known to the company, even now after a gap of 20 years, from the above computer records.   \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The addresses of applicants (except few who would have changed the address) are from Thrissur and every applicant is known to the company___________________________________________________________________________Order in the matter of BRD Securities Limited                                                                  Page 15 of 27 (being already shareholder) / promoter / director. In fact, the DIP guidelines at clause 4.9.4 and the SEBI ICDR also allow the subscription by promoters, their friends and relatives as part of the promoter contribution, implying that applications from these persons are not public offers. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 No invitation or offer was made to a section /class of the public such as depositors, borrowers, bond holders etc.   \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Every application indicates it is a private placement.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 All the applicants are genuine and have been receiving dividends over the last many years whenever declared by the company. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 There are no complaints from any applicant about the impugned issues and the complaints forwarded by SEBI do not pertain to the subject matter of the impugned SCN. The replies on the complaints are enclosed. The details of every applicant and how he/she is known to the company / promoter / director along with an Affidavit from the Managing Director of the Company confirming what is stated herein above are enclosed. It may be observed from the same that substantial applicants were already current shareholders.

Disposed by way of Settlement Order dated March 28, 2018 2.  Mr. Sanjay Jalan AAWPJ2893G 3.  Ms. Anila Jalan AAIPA6667P 4.  Ms. Rinku Jalan AGBPJ8319E (The entities mentioned above are individually known by their respective name or Noticee number) In the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited Background 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) conducted an investigation in the scrip of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited (for convenience \\\\\\\\u201cLe Waterina/ Company\\\\\\\\u201d), for the period of October 01, 2010 to March 05, 2012 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d) for possible violation, if any, of the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (for short \\\\\\\\u201cthe SEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) and rules and regulations made thereunder. 2. During the course of investigation conducted by SEBI, while analyzing the price and trade movement in the scrip of Le Waterina, following facts, inter alia, came to light: a) During the Investigation Period, the face value of the stock was split from \\\\\\\\u20b910 into \\\\\\\\u20b91 with effect from July 04, 2011. In order to have a better analysis of Order in the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited  Page 2 of 33   conduct of various entities, the Investigation Period was divided into pre-stock split period (October 01, 2010 to 03 July, 2011) and post-stock split period (04 July, 2011 to March 05, 2012). b) Mr. Sanjay Jalan (Noticee no. 2) was the promoter of the Company during the Investigation Period. Further, Noticee no. 3 (Ms. Anila Jalan) (mother of Noticee no. 2) and Noticee no. 4 (Ms. Rinku Jalan) (wife of Noticee no. 2) had transferred shares of the Company to various entities (for convenience \\\\\\\\u201csuspected entities\\\\\\\\u201d) through off-market transfers during both pre-stock split period and post stock split period.  c) The suspected entities that received shares of Le Waterina in off-market transactions from the Noticees no. 3 and 4, had traded those shares in the market by executing trades among themselves and thereby created artificial volume in the scrip of the Company.  d) Investigation further observed financial dealings between bank accounts of the Noticees no. 2 and 4. Further, it was observed that the bank account of the Noticee no. 4 was used by the Noticee no. 2 for his business dealings and therefore, the major financial dealings of the Noticee no. 4 were controlled by the Noticee no. 2.  e) Investigation also observed that the Noticee no. 2 was connected to one of the suspected entities through fund transfers. 3. Keeping in view the aforesaid findings of facts as unearthed during the investigation, it has been alleged that the Noticees no. 2 to 4, in connivance with each other had transferred huge quantities of shares of Le Waterina under a scheme or artifice to various suspected entities for creation of artificial volumes in the scrip and thereby causing a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip. Such acts of manipulations in the scrip of Le Waterina by the Noticees no. 2 to 4 were alleged to be in breach of provisions of Section 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulation 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and regulation 4 (1), 4 (2) (a), (d) (g) of the SEBI Order in the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited  Page 3 of 33   (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe PFUTP Regulations, 2003\\\\\\\\u201d). Show Cause Notice and Reply 4. Pursuant to the aforesaid findings during the investigation, a common Show Cause Notice dated January 09, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to the Noticees no. 2 to 4, asking them to show cause as to why suitable directions under Section 11, 11(4) & 11 (B) the SEBI Act, 1992 shall not be issued against them for their alleged acts of violations of provisions of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. 5. I note from the available records that the afore-said SCN was duly served on all the Noticees no. 2 to 4, in response to which the Noticees no. 2 to 4 have submitted their written replies. Subsequently, in compliance with the principle of natural justice, an opportunity of personal hearing was accorded to the Noticees no. 2 to 4 for which the date of hearing was fixed on December 04, 2018 in Mumbai. The hearing notices were duly served upon all the Noticees (Noticees no. 2 to 4) in response to which the Noticees had made a request to hold the personal hearing at Chennai instead of Mumbai, citing financial issues. Considering such a request of the Noticees the Noticees were heard conducted through video conference. During the aforesaid hearing the AR for the Noticees requested for adjournment of the proceedings taking the plea that his clients are willing to settle the matter by filing consent application before SEBI under the extant provisions of Settlement Regulations. The case was scheduled for next hearing on December 20,2018 but had to be adjourned on the request of the Noticees who sought some more time to compile certain information called from them during the previous hearing. The next date for personal hearing in the matter was scheduled on September 13, 2019, which was attended by Noticee no. 2 in person and AR of the Noticees no. 3 and 4. All the Noticees again sought adjournment on the ground of pursuing their respective settlement applications filed with SEBI under the extant consent mechanism. Subsequently, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticees no. 2 to 4 on January 14, 2021 which was attended by Noticee no. 2 in person and AR Order in the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited  Page 4 of 33   of the Noticees no. 3 and 4. It was informed that the application filed by the Noticees no. 2 to 4 for settlement of disputed under the existing settlement mechanism did not materialize and the said applications of the Noticees for settlement were rejected. The case was accordingly discussed and the Noticees were heard on the said date. Considering the above, and the fact that more than sufficient opportunities of personal hearing have been granted to the Noticees no. 2 to 4, I deem it appropriate to proceed in the matter on the basis of materials available on record, including the verbal as well as written replies to the SCN and also the post hearing submissions filed by the Noticees no. 2 to 4, details of which are tabulated below: Table no. 1: Details of replies filed by the Noticees no. 2 to 4 Noticee No.  Date of Reply Noticee no. 2 Letters dated March 01, 2017, March 14, 2017, November 19, 2018, December 18, 2018 and February 03, 2019  Noticee no. 3 Letters dated March 01, 2017, March 14, 2017, November 19, 2018, December 18, 2018 and February 14, 2019 Noticee no. 4 Letters dated March 01, 2017, March 14, 2017, November 19, 2018, December 18, 2018 and February 01, 2019  Submissions of the Noticees no. 2 to 4 6.

However, due to recession in real estate domain, the matter is still pending. Consideration of Issues and Findings 7. Considering the findings of the Investigation, the allegations levelled against the Noticees in the SCN based on such findings, and the explanations offered by the Noticees to the allegations made in the SCN through their written and oral presentations before me, I find that in this case, the issues that require consideration are as follows: Order in the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited  Page 8 of 33   \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Whether the Noticees are successful in rebutting the allegations of transferring shares in off-market mode as a part of fraudulent scheme or are successful in establishing that the transfer of shares was genuine and bonafide and not in violation of the provisions of Section 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulation 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and regulation 4 (1) and 4 (2) (a) (d) and (g) of the SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003? 8. From the perusal of the facts and charges framed in the SCN, I find the investigation has revealed that the price and the volume in the scrip of the Company was manipulated through fraudulent trading in its shares by certain suspected entities. Those suspected entities are seen to have received lacs of shares from the Noticees no. 3 and 4 in off-market transactions and have in turn used those shares (received from Noticees no. 3 and 4) for manipulating the volume and price of the scrip of the Company by indulging in trading amongst themselves on the stock exchange and thereby have created the artificial volume and raised the price of the scrip through such unfair, fraudulent and manipulative trades. Before proceeding further, I note that most of the suspected entities who were found involved in execution of manipulative and fraudulent trades for raising the price and generating artificial volumes in the scrip of the Company are not noticees before me in the present proceedings. The charges made in the SCN have also not categorically imputed the Noticees herein for executing any fraudulent and manipulative trades in the scrip of the Company. Therefore, it would not be within the remit of this SCN to consider and make observation qua those suspected entities, who are not part of the present proceeding. Further, one of such entities who had applied for settlement of the proceedings initiated against him under the settlement mechanism of SEBI, has successfully got his pending proceedings settled upon acceptance of his settlement application and payment of settlement amount made by him in terms of settlement order dated March 28, 2018. Hence, it would also not be fair and proper to make any adverse observation qua him while considering and appreciating the materials available before me in the instant proceedings. In view of the above, my endeavor in the present case pending before me will be to confine the Order in the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited  Page 9 of 33   scope and ambit of the instant proceedings limited to the alleged acts of Noticees no. 2, 3 and 4. (hereinafter collectively referred to as Noticees) in the scrip of the Company including the charge against them for conniving with each other as a part of a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the price and volume of trading in the shares of the Company in violations of various provisions of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. At this juncture, before moving forward on this issue, it would be proper to refer to the relevant regulatory provisions alleged as to have been violated in the SCN which are produced hereunder for ready reference: SEBI Act, 1992 12A. No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; (b) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange; (c) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; Regulation 3 of the SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003: - Prohibition of certain dealings in securities 3. No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; Order in the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited  Page 10 of 33   (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made thereunder.  Regulation 4 of the SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003: - Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices  (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities. (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following, namely:- (a) indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market; (d) inducing any person for dealing in any securities for artificially inflating, depressing, maintaining or causing fluctuation in the price of securities through any means including by paying, offering or agreeing to pay or offer any money or money's worth, directly or indirectly, to any person; (g) entering into a transaction in securities without intention of performing it or without intention of change of ownership of such security. 9. As stated above the allegations against the Noticees no. 3 and 4 in the matter primarily pertains to transfer of huge quantity of shares of Le Waterina to various suspected entities thereby facilitating creation of artificial volumes and artificially inflated price of the scrip of the Company, through unfair fraudulent trades indulged in by those suspected entities. Therefore, to start with, it is pertinent to look at the details of the trades executed by the suspected entities after receipt of shares of the Order in the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited  Page 11 of 33   Company from the Noticees no. 3 and 4 during pre-stock split period and post-stock split period, and those are tabulated below: Table no. 2: Trades of suspected entities Period Gross Buy (number of shares) % of total buy to total traded volume % of matched buy qty with suspected entities Gross Sell (number of shares) % of total sale to total traded volume % of matched sell qty with suspected entities Pre-stock split 12,92,946 41.89 % 54.37% 17,89,937 57.99 % 39.31% Post-stock split  2,28,30,923  62.98%  68.90%  31  2,24,61,631  61.96%  10. I note from the aforesaid table no. 2 that that the suspected entities had contributed to 41.89% and 57.99% of the gross buy and gross sell volumes respectively in the scrip of the Company during the pre-stock split period. I further note that the trading amongst the suspected entities during the pre-stock split period was significant which is evident from the table no. 2 above indicating that 54.37% of gross buy and 39.31% of gross sell of suspected entities who received shares from the Noticees no 3 and 4 were executed and matched with other suspected entities. Similar trading pattern was noticed during the post-stock split period as well, during which the suspected entities had contributed to 62.98% and 61.96% of gross buy and gross sell volumes respectively, in the scrip of Le Waterina. During the said post-stock split period, the suspected entities had been seen executing trades amongst themselves in the scrip of the Company and in the process, the suspected entities were found to have executed and matched 68.90% and 70.04% of their buy and sell trades respectively amongst each other. The aforesaid trade data shows that by way of trading amongst themselves, the suspected entities have contributed significantly to the volumes of trades in the shares of the Company during the Investigation Period. I also note that during the Investigation Period, the price of the scrip increased from of \\\\\\\\u20b935.4(pre-split) to \\\\\\\\u20b910.7 (post-split hence, unadjusted \\\\\\\\u20b9107) by more than 200%, though during the same period, BSE Sensex moved down registering a decrease of 2731.23 Order in the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited  Page 12 of 33   points (13.59%). I also note that no major corporate announcements were made by the Company during the Investigation Period which can substantiate and explain the rationale behind the above noted price rise in the scrip of the Company. It appears that such unusual and abnormal price rise was also contributed by the artificial volumes created by the suspected entities, who received shares from the Noticees no. 3 and 4 and started trading amongst themselves with those shares. The aforesaid facts further strengthen the allegations against the Noticees for having transferred such huge quantities of shares to the suspected entities through off-market mode as well as raises strong suspicion on the intent of the suspected entities and the trading pattern adopted by them while trading in the scrip of the Company.  11. I also note from the records available before me that during the pre-stock split period, out of 189 trading days, suspected entities executed trades among themselves on 117 days and thereby created artificial volumes (41.89% of gross buy and 57.99% of gross sell) in the scrip of Le Waterina. In this regard, out of the said 117 trading days, on 73 days, the traded volume of those suspected entities had constituted more than 25% of respective day\\\\\\\\u2019s total trade volumes. Similarly, during the post-stock split period also, out of 168 trading days, the suspected entities through their inter se trades on 120 trading days have created large artificial volumes in the scrip of Le Waterina. In this regard, it was also seen that out of those 120 trading days during which the suspected entities traded amongst themselves, on 61 days the traded volume of the suspected entities had constituted more than 25% of respective day\\\\\\\\u2019s total trade volumes. A graphical representation of the aforesaid analysis is placed below: Graph 1: Trading pattern of suspected entities during pre-stock split period Order in the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited  Page 13 of 33   Graph 2: Trading pattern of suspected entities during post-stock split period  12. From the foregoing analysis of trading pattern displayed by the suspected entities in the scrip of the Company during the Investigation Period as highlighted above, the suspected entities are seen to have indulged in following a very unusual patterns of trades to deliberately manipulate the trading volumes of the scrip of Le Waterina with a malicious intention to create artificial volumes in the scrip of the Company. 13. As already pointed out above, the Noticees no. 3 and 4 through their transfer of huge quantities of shares of Le Waterina to various suspected entities in off-market mode are alleged to be a part of a fraudulent scheme by facilitating the suspected entities to trade in the scrip for creation of artificial volumes and for inflating the price of the scrip of the Company. Details of transfer of shares of Le Waterina by the Noticees no. 3 and 4, the counterparties to such transfers, sales consideration received by the Noticee no. 3 and 4 as per their submissions etc. are tabulated below for reference: Table no. 3: Details of off-market transfer of shares by Noticee no. 3  Period Date Counterparty (also part of suspected entities)  Number of shares  Price / Share (in \\\\\\\\u20b9) Sale Consideration (in \\\\\\\\u20b9) Whether Payment received Pre-Spilt Period 19.10.2010 Ramdos^ 10000 - - - 19.10.2010 Rinku Jalan (Noticee no. 4)* 4,50,000 Gift Gift NA Order in the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited  Page 14 of 33   19.10.2010 Bharat Thakkar^ 2,00,000 - - - 19.10.2010 Sub Total (Pre-Spilt Period) (A) 6,60,000    Post-Spilt Period 21.07.2011 Kamlesh Jain 30,00,000 1.5 45,00,000 No 28.07.2011 Ferrah Devang Vyas 4,00,000 1.5 6,00,000 No 06.08.2011 Miatru Agro 12,00,000 1.5 18,00,000 No 24.08.2011 Rinku Jalan (Noticee no. 4) 11,58,550 Gift Gift No  Sub Total (Post-Spilt Period) (B) 57,58,550  69,00,000    Total (A+B) 64,18,550  69,00,000  ^ Price details not provided by the Noticee no.3    *  Not one of the suspected entities Table no. 4: Details of off-market transfer of shares by Noticee no. 4  Period Date Counterparty (also part of suspected entities) Number of shares  Price / Share (in \\\\\\\\u20b9) Sale Consideration (in \\\\\\\\u20b9) Whether Payment received Pre-Spilt Period 04.10.2010 On Market 205 36 7,380 Yes 07.10.2010 Shakuntala Devi 28,000 42 11,76,000 Yes 07.10.2010 Gandhe Shiva Kumar 22,000 42 9,24,000 Yes 08.10.2010 Miatru Agro 2,00,000 40 80,00,000 No 13.10.2010 Kalpana M Golecha 5,000 52 2,60,000 Yes 13.10.2010 Bharat Thakkar 90,000 52 46,80,000 Yes 08.11.2010 Miatru Agro 1,50,000 40 60,00,000 No 08.12.2010 Miatru Agro 63,000 40 25,20,000 No 16.12.2010 Miatru Agro 2,00,000 40 80,00,000 No Order in the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited  Page 15 of 33   18.02.2011 J Shankar* 6,250 110 6,87,500 Yes 23.03.2011 Bhuvaneshwari* 15,000 90 13,50,000 Yes  Sub Total (Pre-Spilt Period) (A) 7,79,455  3,36,04,880  Post-Spilt Period 21.07.2011 Kamlesh Jain 20,00,000 1.5 30,00,000 No 23.09.2011 Jegannath 1,000 7.5 7,500 Yes 21.09.2011 Miatru Agro 27,00,000 6.63 1,79,01,000 No 11.01.2012 Sangam Agro 2,00,000 12.94 25,88,000 No  Sub Total (Post-Spilt Period) (B) 49,01,000  2,34,96,500    Total (A+B) 56,80,455  5,71,01,380    *  Not part of the suspected entities 14. I note from the aforesaid table that during the Investigation period, the Noticee no. 3 had transferred 64.18 lacs shares in the off-market, out of which 16.08 lacs were transferred to her daughter-in-law (Noticee no. 4), while the remaining 48.10 lacs shares were claimed to have been sold to various suspected entities for which Noticee no. 3 had failed to provide any evidence of receipt of sales consideration. Similarly, the Noticee no. 4 had sold 56.80 lacs shares of the Company to different suspected entities and out of total receivable sales consideration of \\\\\\\\u20b95.71 crores (\\\\\\\\u20b95,71,01,380), she has been able to provide details of receipt of only \\\\\\\\u20b990.92 lacs (\\\\\\\\u20b990,92,380) and reportedly has not been able to recover the remaining sales consideration of \\\\\\\\u20b94.8 crores (\\\\\\\\u20b94,80,09,000) from suspected entities. It is not disputed that the above noted shares of the Company were transferred by the two Noticees (Noticees no. 3 and 4) in off-market mode. The two Noticees have accepted the fact that they have transferred the aforesaid quantities of shares to various suspected entities and have also submitted that they have not yet received even till date, the full sales consideration amount from those counter party off-marker buyers. Order in the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited  Page 16 of 33   15. I note that in response to the allegation of helping the suspected entities to create artificial volume in the scrip through unfair and fraudulent trades by way of off-market transfers of huge quantities of shares to those entities, the Noticee no. 3 has submitted in her defense by stating that the shares of the Company were sold by her in order to financially secure her retired life. Similarly, the Noticee no. 4 has submitted that as she was already separated from her husband (Noticee no. 2) she sold those shares to secure future of her children. Regarding the rational for selling such large quantities of shares outside the stock exchange platform, both of them (Noticees no. 3 and 4) have taken a plea that as they were not aware about the procedures of the stock exchange, they preferred to sell such shares in the off-market. During the personal hearing, Noticees no. 3 and 4 were asked to submit their demat account statement to further verify the authenticity of their claims, however no demat account statements have been provided by the two Noticees so far. Incidentally, Noticee no. 4, vide her reply dated February 01, 2019 while providing the details of her off-market trades in the scrip of the Company, has, inter alia submitted that as on October 04, 2010, she had sold 205 shares of the Company on stock exchange platform at a price of \\\\\\\\u20b936 per share. Keeping the aforesaid fact into consideration and the fact that Noticees no. 3 and 4 have not furnished the demat accounts nor have they denied that they do not have any demat accounts to substantiate their claim of ignorance about stock exchange mechanism, it is not possible to accept that these two Noticees being part of the promoter group of a listed company were completely oblivious about the advantages of trading through stock exchange platform. Trading on a stock exchange provides a mechanism of settlement guarantee for the respective trade by the stock exchange /clearing corporation, wherein the stock exchange / clearing corporation acts as a counterparty to such trades and takes the responsibility for settlement of such trades. It is impossible to believe that while on the one hand the Noticees no. 3 and 4 were selling large quantities of shares purportedly to financially secure their future on the other hand, they chose off-market mechanism to sell their shares wherein Order in the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited  Page 17 of 33   there was no guarantee of settlement of their transactions, by ignoring the established stock exchange platform to and deciding to offload huge quantities of their shares in the scrip of the Company to various entities in a bilateral manner without being able to enforce payment by the buyers. Therefore, the submission of the Noticees no. 3 and 4 who had already previous experience of trading on exchange platform stating that they preferred off-market transfers as they were not aware about the stick exchange mechanism turns out to be far removed", "Date": "2021-05-24", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Order In the matter of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/may-2021/order-in-the-matter-of-le-waterina-resorts-and-hotels-limited_50246.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 62897, "unique_record_id": "461afa008dSEBI20210524", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6682130d7858910306472f88", "parse_date": "2024-07-01 02:22:27", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": null, "gpt_audience": "1. **Regulatory Authorities**: Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\n2. **Legal Professionals**: Lawyers and legal advisors specializing in securities law\n3. **Financial Analysts**: Professionals analyzing market manipulation and fraudulent activities\n4. **Investors**: Shareholders and potential investors in Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited\n5. **Corporate Governance Experts**: Professionals focusing on corporate ethics and compliance\n6. **Company Management**: Executives and board members of Le Waterina Resorts and Hotels Limited\n7. **Academic Researchers**: Scholars studying securities regulation and market manipulation\n8. **Media**: Financial journalists and reporters covering regulatory actions and market integrity\n9. **Compliance Officers**: Professionals ensuring adherence to securities laws and regulations\n10. **Stock Exchange Officials**: Personnel from stock exchanges monitoring trading activities", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

Based on the finding of facts, an impounding order cum Show Cause Notice dated September 04, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued against the Noticees inter-alia directing impounding of the alleged unlawful loss avoided by them from their trades executed while in possession of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018UPSI\\\\\\\\u2019) and the Noticees were directed to deposit the same amount in an interest bearing Escrow Account with a Nationalized Bank.

From the perusal of the impounding order cum SCN, certain facts necessary for the purpose of adjudication of issues involved in the instant proceeding and based on which allegations have been made against the Noticees are captured herein as under;  5.1 The Company had incurred a loss of INR 166.80 Crore during the quarter ended September 2017 as compared to a net loss of INR 6.62 Crore during the quarter ended June 2017 i.e. an increase in the net loss by more than 25 times between the two consecutive quarters and on a quarter to quarter basis between June 2017 and Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited Page 3 of 42  September 2017, the net sales of the Company fell from INR 227.04 Crore to INR 70.31 Crore i.e. by 69%.  5.2 The said Quarterly financial results of the Company for quarter ended September 2017 was disclosed to the stock exchanges after the closing of the market on November 29, 2017. It is noticed that the day subsequent to the disclosure of the above Quarterly financial result i.e. on November 30, 2017, the price of scrip of the Company decreased by 6.48% and the total trading volume (combined on NSE and BSE) increased by 181.00% as compared to the previous day. The said Financial Results of the Company for Quarter ended September 2017 was alleged to be an UPSI in terms of regulation 2 (1) (n) of the PIT Regulations. 5.3 It is also alleged that Noticee no. 1, being the CMD of the Company, was privy to the UPSI as he was in the supervision, control and management of the affairs of the Company. In view of this, it is alleged that Noticee no. 1 was in possession of UPSI from October 02, 2017 (First Monday post quarter ended September 30, 2017) and during the period when the said price sensitive information was not in public domain (commencing from October 02, 2017 till the day of disclosure i.e. November 29, 2017) and was known and possessed by only certain people, the said period is termed as UPSI period (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018UPSI Period\\\\\\\\u2019).  5.4 It was observed that Noticee no. 1 sold 30,93,498 shares (net sale) of TJL during the UPSI period. During this period, it was also observed that Noticee no. 1 sold 1,36,720 shares and bought 1,12,000 shares of the Company on October 10, 2017 allegedly to give an appearance of buying in addition to selling shares of TJL during the UPSI period. Being allegedly aware of the UPSI, it was alleged that Noticee no. 1, had sold shares of TJL during the UPSI Period to avoid future losses, which is alleged to be in violation of the provisions of Section 12A(d) & (e) of the SEBI Act read with regulation 4(1) of the PIT Regulations.  5.5 It is also alleged that Noticee no. 1 has communicated/provided/allowed access to the said UPSI to his daughters Noticees no. 2 & 3, who have also traded in the shares of TJL while in possession of the UPSI. Based on the above, the Noticee no. 1 is Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited Page 4 of 42  further alleged to have violated the provision of regulation 3(1) of the PIT Regulations. 5.6 It is observed that, during the said UPSI period, Noticees no. 2 & 3 sold their entire holding in TJL whereas both of them didn\\\\\\\\u2019t trade in the scrip of TJL prior to or after UPSI period. In continuation of the allegations against Noticee no. 1, the trading of Noticees no. 2 & 3 were also alleged to be insider trading and Noticees no. 2 & 3 have also acted in violation of the provisions of Section 12A (d) & (e) of the SEBI Act read with regulation 4(1) of the PIT Regulations, due to their act of selling the shares of TJL, while in possession of UPSI.  5.7 In view of the above, it is alleged that the Noticees no. 1, 2 & 3 have unlawfully avoided a notional loss of INR 1,26,59,481.50, INR 2,09,930.40 and INR 9,62,060.70 respectively through their dealings in the scrip of the Company which were allegedly acts of insider trading committed by them. 5.8 It is further noticed that the Noticees have not obtained pre-clearance for the trades executed by them during the investigation period from the Compliance Officer of TJL in compliance with the provisions of Code of Conduct adopted by the Company for prevention of insider trading and hence it is alleged that they have acted in violation of Clause 6 of Schedule B read with sub-Regulations (1) and (2) of Regulation 9 of the PIT Regulations. 5.9 Noticee no. 1, despite being a specified person of the Company, had entered into contra trades within 6 months of his previous trade when he sold 1,36,720 shares and purchased 1,12,000 shares of TJL on October 10, 2017. In view of this, it is alleged that he has violated Clause 10 of Model Code of Conduct for prevention of Insider Trading prescribed at Schedule B read with sub-Regulations (1) & (2) of regulation 9 of the PIT Regulations. REPLY, PERSONAL HEARING AND SUBMISSIONS 6. In response to the SCN, the Noticees vide their common reply dated November 26, 2020 have made common submissions which were also reiterated by Shri Ankit Lohia, Advocate Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited Page 5 of 42  appeared for ALMT Legal, the Authorized Representative (AR) on behalf of the Noticees, on March 04, 2021, when an opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticees. Subsequent to the personal hearing, the Noticees have again made a common post hearing written submission dated March 22, 2021 in response to certain queries raised before them for clarification during the course of personal hearing. In the aforesaid written submissions dated November 26, 2020 and March 04, 2021, the Noticees have offered the following explanations in their defense : a. The jewellery market all over the world, especially in the Asian region, was facing difficulties since 2015-2016 leading to delayed payments and cancellation of orders by several customers. The failure to receive timely payments and cancellation of orders by customers directly put substantial strain on the business and the financials of the Company, as the Company was largely into retailing and exporting of diamond jewellery/articles across various countries and predominantly to the United States of America. The crash of the Chinese stock market in 2015 also affected the global diamond market leading to deterioration in financial position of the Company. b. The Noticees have stated that in or around 2016, the Company started defaulting in payment of interest against the working capital facilities of approximately INR 750 Crore availed of from several banks and in November 2016, a joint lenders forum (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cJLF\\\\\\\\u201d) was formed for Revitalizing of Distressed Assets. The JLF recognised the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s account as stressed and some banks classified it as an SMA-2 account.  c. The Noticees have further submitted that they requested consortium member banks for reliefs so as to secure working capital for larger orders, to avoid cancellation of those orders. This was in an attempt to avoid any impact on sales of the Company closer to Christmas which is the most crucial time of the year as 90% of the customer base of the Company was from United States of America who generally purchases jewelries around this time of the year. However, the Banks refused to grant further loans pending a resolution and therefore compelled Noticee no. 1 to find an Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited Page 6 of 42  alternative way to raise the funds to avoid the Company from being down-graded to a non-performing asset (\\\\\\\\u201cNPA\\\\\\\\u201d). d. Noticee no. 1 has submitted that he was under continued pressure from the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s Lenders to infuse funds into the Company to meet some working capital requirements. The Noticees have stated that all the assets of the Company were charged to eleven banks and Noticee no. 1 had also pledged approximately 40% of his shares in the Company as additional collateral. e. Noticee no, 1 has contended that in the light of the above circumstances, he was left with no option but to sell his unencumbered shares of the Company to raise some capital to be able to fund the Company in order to discharge some of its obligations including paying employee wages and salaries through the lenders loan account and with lenders\\\\\\\\u2019 permission. To achieve this end, he also caused the sale of the shares held by his daughters Noticees no. 2 & 3; which were under his control and were part of the family holding. f. The Noticees have submitted that Noticees no. 2 & 3, though employed in the Company, had no specific UPSI in their hands and they had sold shares only to assist Noticee no. 1.  g. All the proceeds of sale of shares during the investigation period were almost immediately reinvested in the Company by depositing the same into the Company's account with its lead bank (State Bank of India) and all payments from this account were made with SBI\\\\\\\\u2019s knowledge and under its supervision. The payments made were mainly towards wages and salaries, material purchase, factory overheads and operational costs. The Noticees also submitted that they had duly fulfilled all the disclosure obligations attracted by their trades.  h. The Noticees have denied that the Financial Results for quarter ended September 2017 constituted a UPSI on the ground that the Company was struggling financially since 2016 and the said fact was in public knowledge due to continuous fall in sales. This had also led to rapid fall in the price of the scrip since 2016. Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited Page 7 of 42  i. Noticee no. 1 has contended that he did not have any information that could be construed as UPSI. It was in public knowledge that the Company was financially struggling and that it was likely to be taken by the Lenders to the NCLT for liquidation. Had the infusion of sales proceeds into the Company not been done, the Company would have faced greater trouble from the Lenders, leading to a steeper downfall of the Company. The Noticees also submitted that all the money was reinvested as unsecured loans, despite knowing the fact they would not be able to recover this money if the Company went into liquidation. j. Noticee no. 1 has contended that he had brought to the attention of the Board, the financial stress being faced by the Company, updated them on the efforts being made with the banks and his requirement to sell his shares to bring in working capital to the Company. k. Noticee no. 1 has also stated that a total number of 29,75,000 shares were pledged with Comfort Fincap Limited against a short term loan of INR 3,00,00,000/- (Rupees Three Crore Only) to the Company at a higher rate of interest repayable in 6 months with the pledged shares having a value of approximately 3 times the loan amount. By October 2017, the repayment of loan taken from Comfort Fincap Limited became mandatory. Therefore, he sold his unencumbered shares to repay Comfort Fincap Ltd. and unpledged his shares having value of approximately three times the loan amount. He then sold these unencumbered shares to bring working capital into the Company. l. The Noticees have submitted that the pre clearance for the sale of shares was sought from the Compliance Officer. Since the Compliance Officer was aware of the management decision for the sale of shares and made all necessary disclosures to the stock exchanges it is evident that necessary compliances were followed. m. Noticee no. 1 has also stated that the alleged purchase of 1,12,000 shares on October 10, 2017 was due to technical error on the part of his broker wherein the transaction had automatically picked the option of \\\\\\\\u201cAuto-settlement\\\\\\\\u201d, which made it an intra-day transaction. Due to this, the buy transaction was nothing but square off trade at trade time 15:17:03 on the day of the selling and hence the same has been reflected Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited Page 8 of 42  as a purchase. This transaction was routed through the stock exchange and security transaction tax (STT) was paid. CONSIDERATION  7. I have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case and the materials available on record. I note that the allegations levelled against the Noticees are broadly as follows:  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In violation of regulation 3(1) of PIT Regulations, Noticee no. 1 has communicated the UPSI to Noticees 2 & 3. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In violation of the provisions of Section 12(d) & (e) of the SEBI Act read with regulation 4(1) of the PIT Regulations, the Noticees have traded in the scrip of TJL while being in possession of UPSI.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In violation of clause 6 of Model Code of Conduct for prevention of insider trading, the Noticees have traded in the scrip of TJL without obtaining pre-clearance for their trades.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In violation of clause 10 of Model Code of Conduct for prevention of insider trading, Noticee no. 1 has executed contra trades in the scrip of TJL within a period of 6 months from previous trade. 8. Before dealing with the submissions of the Noticees, it would be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of law pertaining to the matter, extract whereof is reproduced below:  SEBI ACT, 1992 Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control. 12A. No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (d) engage in insider trading;  (e) deal in securities while in possession of material or non-public information or communicate such material or non-public information to any other person, in a Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited Page 9 of 42  manner which is in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; PIT Regulations Communication or procurement of unpublished price sensitive information. 3.(1) No insider shall communicate, provide, or allow access to any unpublished price sensitive information, relating to a company or securities listed or proposed to be listed, to any person including other insiders except where such communication is in furtherance of legitimate purposes, performance of duties or discharge of legal obligations. Trading when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information. 4.(1) No insider shall trade in securities that are listed or proposed to be listed on a stock exchange when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information:  Provided that the insider may prove his innocence by demonstrating the circumstances including the following: \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u2026.. (iii) the transaction in question was carried out pursuant to a statutory or regulatory obligation to carry out a bona fide transaction. NOTE: When a person who has traded in securities has been in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, his trades would be presumed to have been motivated by the knowledge and awareness of such information in his possession. The reasons for which he trades or the purposes to which he applies the proceeds of the transactions are not intended to be relevant for determining whether a person has violated the regulation. He traded when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information is what would need to be demonstrated at the outset to bring a charge. Once this is established, it would be open to the insider to prove his innocence by demonstrating the circumstances mentioned in the proviso, failing which he would have violated the prohibition. Allegation of Insider Trading w.r.t. Noticee 1 9. It is alleged that the Quarterly Financial Result of the Company for quarter ended September 2017 was an UPSI during the period of October 02, 2017 to November 29, Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited Page 10 of 42  2017. It is further alleged that Noticee no. 1, as the CMD of the Company, was in possession of UPSI during the UPSI Period and had traded in the scrip of TJL during the UPSI period while in possession of UPSI.  10. In this regard, Noticee no. 1 had made two fold submissions wherein firstly he has contended that contrary to the allegations there was no UPSI in existence and secondly he was not in possession of any UPSI during the said UPSI period so as to be held liable for a serious charge of insider trading.  11. I note that, the term UPSI has been defined at regulation 2(1)(n) of PIT Regulations as following: \\\\\\\\u201c\"unpublished price sensitive information\" means any information, relating to a company or its securities, directly or indirectly, that is not generally available which upon becoming generally available, is likely to materially affect the price of the securities and shall, ordinarily including but not restricted to, information relating to the following: \\\\\\\\u2013 (i)financial results; \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.. NOTE: It is intended that information relating to a company or securities, that is not generally available would be unpublished price sensitive information if it is likely to materially affect the price upon coming into the public domain. The types of matters that would ordinarily give rise to unpublished price sensitive information have been listed out above to give illustrative guidance of unpublished price sensitive information.\\\\\\\\u201d 12. From the above, it is evident that the definition of UPSI is an inclusive definition and not limited and restricted to the instances mentioned therein. The definition in clear and unequivocal term included \\\\\\\\u2018financial result\\\\\\\\u2019 as an UPSI without subjecting the same to any condition. The definition further goes on to hold an information as UPSI which is not generally available and which upon publication or disclosure is likely to materially affect the price of the securities. In this regard, I need to examine the said Quarterly financial results of the Company in comparison to different other Quarterly financial results for Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited Page 11 of 42  certain quarters close to the quarter ended September 2017, which are presented as below: Table 1: Financial Results of the Company for Calendar Year 2017 Description  Quarter Ended (Amount in Rs. Crore)  MAR- 2017  JUN- 2017 SEP \\\\\\\\u2013 2017 DEC - 2017 Net sales 307.85 227.04 70.31 70.77 Other Income 1.42 2.21 2.14 1.42 Total Income 309.27 229.25 72.45 72.19 Profit/loss after tax -8.93 -6.62 -166.80 -201.18 The above table shows that the Company was in loss for the last two quarters prior to quarter ended September 2017 and the net loss incurred by the Company in the quarter ended September 2017 was INR 166.80 Crore as compared to a net loss of INR 6.62 Crore for the quarter ended June, 2017. Therefore, it is observed from the financials of the Company that on a quarter to quarter basis between June 2017 and September 2017, the net sales of the Company fell by 69% and net loss increased by 2420%.  13. I also note that the scrip of TJL closed at INR 21.60 per share on the NSE on November 29, 2017. Thereafter, consequent to disclosure of the abovementioned Quarterly financial results after the closing hours of share market on that day, the scrip of TJL opened at INR 20.10 per shares on November 30, 2017 and closed at INR 20.20 after touching a low of INR 18.55 per share on NSE. This shows that, subsequent to the disclosure of the Quarterly financial results of the Company for the quarter ending September 2017, the price of the scrip of TJL fell by 6.48% as compared to the previous day closing price on NSE. Similar price movement was also observed on the BSE. At the same time, the combined trading volume of TJL on the two stock exchanges witnessed a tremendous increase from 2,60,566 shares to 7,32,000 shares during this period which shows an increment of 181% in trading volume subsequent to the said disclosure of Quarterly financial result. In view of the above, irrespective of the fact that the definition of UPSI includes \\\\\\\\u2018financial results\\\\\\\\u2019 as an UPSI, the reaction of the market pursuant to the said disclosure of the Quarterly financial result of the Company for quarter ended September 2017 strongly substantiates Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited Page 12 of 42  the aforesaid provisions in the PIT regulations to hold the said Quarterly financial result as a price sensitive information. This observation further gets confirmed from the fact that the disclosure of the above stated Quarterly financial result has indeed materially impacted the price as well as volume in the scrip of TJL wherein the shareholders of the Company, upon noticing such an unprecedented loss, are seen to have been selling the shares of the Company on the very first trading day subsequent to the disclosure of the said financial results. Thus, in this case the market price of the scrip is evidently observed to have been influenced by the disclosure of the Price Sensitive Information (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018PSI\\\\\\\\u2019), i.e. financial results for the quarter ending September 2017.  14. The Noticee no. 1 has contended that the declaration of the Quarterly financial results of the Company can\\\\\\\\u2019t be termed as a UPSI, since the fact that the Company was going through a tough phase and was incurring financial losses for the past few quarters was already in the public domain, hence, there was nothing which can be said to be unpublished and price sensitive in nature in the Quarterly financial results. Having gone through the replies of the Noticee no. 1 and the submissions advanced on this issue, I consider the said arguments to be patently erroneous. As noted above, the Company had incurred losses in the past two quarters also, but the past quarterly financial losses can not undermine the price sensitiveness of the succeeding quarterly financial results more so when the definition prescribed under the PIT Regulations, in clear and unambiguous terms, includes within its ambit, the financial result of a company, as PSI. It should be noted that the said definition of UPSI does not make any distinction between good or bad financial results. Further, the said definition also does not carve out any exception to suggest that a historically consistent financial performance of a company for any quarter or any other prior period would not render the financial results of a subsequent period to be treated as a PSI. In case the argument of the Noticee no. 1 that historically the financial performance of the Company for the last two quarters have resulted in losses which was known to the public at large, hence, the financial results of the subsequent quarter showing losses do not constitute price sensitive information is accepted, then the Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited Page 13 of 42  historically declared good results for the earlier quarters would also have to excluded from being termed as a price sensitive information following the same logic that the past quarterly profits are also available in public domain which in my view amounts to a gross misinterpretation of the definition of UPSI as prescribed under the PIT Regulations. As observed above that the definition with respect to price sensitivity of information under the PIT Regulations categorically includes financial result of a company as a PSI and a plain reading of the said provisions indicate that the quarterly financial results of a company do not depend on the good or bad financial performance of the company during the preceding historical quarters/period, to fall under the definition of PSI. Needless to state that both profit and loss of a company are equally important, material and sensitive from the point of view of an investor who is supposed to take his investment (buy/sale) decision depending on the good or bad financial results of a company as soon as the same is known to the public. Therefore, rightly so, the definition under the PIT Regulations, treats any financial result of a listed entity even on standalone basis, a PSI irrespective of the performance of a company during the other quarters or periods, since the extent of financial performance of a company, positive or negative, is likely to have a material impact on the scrip of the company. In view of the above, I find no hesitation in holding that the financial result of the Company for the quarter ending on September 30, 2017 on a standalone basis was indeed a PSI both on fact and in law and remained in existence and not being generally available till it was disclosed on November 29, 2017. 15. The SCN proceeds to allege that the Noticee no. 1 being insider and in possession of the UPSI had traded in the scrip of the Company. In this respect, it is noted that in terms of the provisions of Section 12(d) & (e) of SEBI Act as well as under regulation 4(1) of PIT Regulations, an insider is prohibited from dealing in the securities of a company while in possession of UPSI. Hence, in order to adjudge the charge of insider trading, it becomes imperative to examine as to whether the Noticee no. 1, being an insider, had traded in shares of the Company while in possession of the UPSI. Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited Page 14 of 42  16. Having gone through the relevant provisions of law, it is noted that no insider shall trade in securities of the company when in possession of UPSI. Thus, the provisions of PIT Regulations lays down a pre-requisite that a person alleged to have indulged in insider trading has to be an insider. In this respect, it is noted above that that the term \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d is defined under regulation 2(1)(g) of PIT Regulations. The relevant portion of the said provision is reproduced hereunder: 2(1)(g) \"insider\" means any person who is: i) a connected person; or  ii) in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information; 17. The above definition provides that there can be two categories of insiders i.e. first, one who is a connected person of the company and second, one who is in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information. The term \\\\\\\\u2018connected person\\\\\\\\u2019 is further defined under regulation 2(1) (d) of the PIT Regulations as under:- 2(1)(d) \"connected person\" means,- (i) any person who is or has during the six months prior to the concerned act been associated with a company, directly or indirectly, in any capacity including by reason of frequent communication with its officers or by being in any contractual, fiduciary or employment relationship or by being a director, officer or an employee of the company or holds any position including a professional or business relationship between himself and the company whether temporary or permanent, that allows such person, directly or indirectly, access to unpublished price sensitive information or is reasonably expected to allow such access.  18. From the perusal of the aforesaid governing provisions, the definition of a \\\\\\\\u2018connected person\\\\\\\\u2019 is self-explanatory which does not need further elaboration and apart from a connected person, an insider also includes any other person who though may not be connected directly or indirectly to the company but can also become an insider, if he is in possession of or is having access to UPSI. In this respect, it is worthwhile to add here that Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited Page 15 of 42  to qualify as an \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d, it is not material to show as to how the said insider has come in possession of or has access to such unpublished information.  19. Keeping in view the definition of \\\\\\\\u2018insider\\\\\\\\u2019 as explained above, the status of Noticee no. 1 as an insider of the company has to be examined. I note from the shareholding pattern of TJL, as available on the website of BSE and NSE, that Noticee no. 1 was a Promoter as well as the largest shareholder of the Company during the investigation period (IP) and was holding 58.90% of total issued share capital of the Company as on September 30, 2017. Further, Noticee no. 1 was admittedly the CMD during the IP. Therefore, on a bare perusal of above noted definition of an insider prescribed under the PIT Regulations, I find that Noticee no. 1, being the CMD in TJL at the given point of time , was certainly a \\\\\\\\u2018connected person\\\\\\\\u2019 with the Company and therefore an insider under regulation 2(1) (g) (i) of the PIT Regulations. It is further observed that the Noticee no. 1 has acknowledged to have all the information pertaining to the financia", "Date": "2021-05-24", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Final Order in the matter of Insider Trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited [SAT Appeal No.: 536/2021]", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/may-2021/final-order-in-the-matter-of-insider-trading-in-the-scrip-of-tara-jewels-limited_50260.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 62878, "unique_record_id": "21a4351534SEBI20210524", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6682110a7858910306472f6a", "parse_date": "2024-07-01 02:13:52", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Title: Order in the matter of Insider trading in the scrip of Tara Jewels Limited - Category: Fraud - Insider Trading", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "INR 1,26,59,481.50  \nINR 2,09,930.40  \nINR 9,62,060.70", "gpt_audience": "- Regulatory authorities\n- Legal professionals\n- Investors and shareholders of Tara Jewels Limited\n- Company management and employees\n- Financial analysts and market researchers\n- Compliance officers\n- Media and financial journalists", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

Ms. Geeta Bhatia  AAGPB8685G  (The above entities are individually referred to by their corresponding names/numbers and collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d)  BACKGROUND 1. Pursuant to complaint(s) received in respect of merger between Tree House Education and Accessories Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cTHEAL/the Company\\\\\\\\u201d) and Zee Learn Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cZLL\\\\\\\\u201d) alleging inter alia irregularities committed pertaining to the said merger plans between THEAL and ZLL and insider trading by promoters etc., the Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) conducted investigation into trading activities in the scrip of the Company during  the period of  November 30, 2015 to December 04, 2015 (hereinafter referred as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Investigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d). The shares of the Company are listed on the BSE India Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe BSE\\\\\\\\u201d) & the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe NSE\\\\\\\\u201d and the BSE and the NSE collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe stock exchanges\\\\\\\\u201d).  2. Based on the facts revealed during the course of the investigation, a Show Cause Notice dated February 17, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe SCN/Notice\\\\\\\\u201d) was  issued to the Noticees asking them to show cause as to why suitable directions and penalty under sections 11(1), 11(4), 11(4A), 11B(1) and 11B(2) read with sections 15G, 15A(b) & 15HB of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe SEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d)  should not be issued/imposed against them for their alleged violations of Section 12A(d) &__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of insider trading activities of certain entities in the scrip of Tree House Education and Accessories Ltd.

The brief findings of the investigation and the allegations made on the basis of such findings of investigation, as contained in the SCN, are as under: (a) Mr. Rajesh Doulatram Bhatia (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticee no. 1\\\\\\\\u201d) and Ms. Geeta Rajesh Bhatia (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticee no. 2\\\\\\\\u201d) were Managing Director and Non-Executive Director respectively, and were also promoters of the Company. Both of them were part of the management of the Company during the Investigation Period.  (b) In terms of information furnished by the Company vide its letter dated January 05, 2018, it is noticed that on November 30, 2015, a discussion on merger between THEAL and ZLL took place. Further, the Company vide its letter dated March 11, 2017 to the BSE has, inter alia, submitted that \\\\\\\\u201cI (Mr. Rajesh) state that during November 2015 had a meeting with Mr. Subhash Chandra Goel through one Mr. Ganesh of Inga Capital wherein, Mr. Subhash Chandra Goel had discussed the possibility of merger of his company Zee Learn Ltd. with Tree House for the share exchange ratio of 53 shares of Re. 1/ each of Zee Learn Ltd with 10 shares of Tree House.\\\\\\\\u201d  (c) On December 04, 2015, before market hours, the Company made a corporate announcement relating to merger between THEAL and ZLL. The price of the scrip of the Company witnessed a rise from a closing price of INR 202.40 on December 03, 2015 to the closing price of INR 222.60 on December 04, 2015 i.e., an increase by 9.98% in one trading day. In terms of regulation 2 (1) (n) of the PIT Regulations, prior to its disclosure to the stock exchanges on December 04, 2015, the aforesaid corporate announcement by the Company relating to consolidation /merger options with ZLL was an Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cUPSI\\\\\\\\u201d). (d) The Noticees no. 1 and 2 are alleged as insiders in terms of regulation 2 (1) (g) (i) of the PIT Regulations, as the Noticee no. 1 being the Managing Director and the Noticee no. 2 being a Director of the Company are connected persons, in terms of regulation 2 (1) (d) (i) of the PIT Regulations and the Noticee no. 2 being the spouse of the Noticee no. 1, is also deemed to be a connected person as per regulation 2 (1) (d) (ii) (a) of the PIT Regulations.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of insider trading activities of certain entities in the scrip of Tree House Education and Accessories Ltd.                                       Page 3 of 33                       (e) Prior to its disclosure of the Price Sensitive Information (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPSI\\\\\\\\u201d) to the stock exchanges on December 04, 2015, it was noticed that both the Noticees being insiders had traded in the scrip of the Company when/while in possession of UPSI.  4. The above acts of the Noticees no. 1 and 2 of indulging in trading in the scrip of the Company while in possession of UPSI prior to disclosure of the said PSI through announcement on the stock exchanges are alleged to be in violation of regulation 4(1) of the PIT Regulations and Section 12A(d) & (e) of the SEBI Act. The Noticee no. 1 being in possession of the UPSI is further alleged to have communicated the same to his wife i.e., the Noticee no. 2 and thereby has acted in violation of regulation 3(1) of the PIT Regulations. The Noticees had obtained pre-clearance(on December 02, 2015) of trades executed by them on December 03, 2015 and are therefore, alleged to have given incorrect declaration to the Company regarding non possession of UPSI for the purpose of obtaining preclearance and hence, are alleged to have acted in violation of Clause 6 of the Minimum Standards for Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Insiders as specified in Schedule B read with regulation 9(1) of the PIT Regulations. Further, the Noticees no. 1 and 2 are also alleged to have made disclosures under regulation 29(2) r/w 29(3) of the Takeover Regulations with a delay of 3 days to the BSE and a delay of 10 days to the NSE relating to the above trades executed by them in the scrip of the Company and thereby alleged to have violated regulation 29(2) r/w 29(3) of the Takeover Regulations. REPLY, PERSONAL HEARING AND SUBMISSIONS  5. In response to the SCN, the Noticees vide their common reply dated October 21, 2020 have submitted as under: 5.1 The present SCN has been issued with an inordinate delay of almost 4 years and is merely an afterthought. The law dealing with such inordinate delay has been dealt with by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in Rakesh Kathotia vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 7 of 2016, decided on May 27, 2019), Ashok Shivlal Rupani & Anr. vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 417 of 2018, decided on August 22, 2019) and Ashlesh Shah vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 169 of 2019, decided on January 31, 2020).  5.2 The copy of Investigation Report, as referred to in the SCN, has not been furnished to them and the same is denied despite a specific request made in this regard.  5.3 The sale of 40 Lakh shares of the Company was altogether a different transaction unrelated to the merger talks for which appropriate disclosure on the stock exchanges__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of insider trading activities of certain entities in the scrip of Tree House Education and Accessories Ltd.                                       Page 4 of 33                       was made. The said sale was made only with the purpose to repay the loan due to the banks.  5.4 Proposal of merger was mooted by Mr. Subhash Chandra Goel only after ZLL /Subhash Chandra Goel acquired approx. 9% stake in the Company. There was no UPSI in existence either on December 02, 2015 or December 03, 2015 when shares were sold under Block Deals. 5.5 It is rather counter intuitive for a person in possession of UPSI to sell shares when the effect of UPSI upon publication is such that it would result in increase in price of shares. In this regard, reliance is placed on decision of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in Mrs. Chandrakala vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 209 of 2011, decided on January 31, 2012). 5.6 In case UPSI was in existence at the time when 40 Lakh shares were sold, the buyers of the shares would also be aware of and in possession of UPSI (therefore they would also be insider as per the definition of \\\\\\\\u2018insider\\\\\\\\u2019 under the PIT Regulations). The very fact that SEBI has not issued any SCN to the buyers after completing the investigation, clearly suggests that upon completion of investigation, Zee group/6 entities who bought the shares were not found to be in possession of UPSI. Therefore, it cannot be alleged that there existed any UPSI before December 04, 2015. 5.7 The allegations are based on remote possibilities and the same are not backed by any concrete document or evidence which support or even suggest any insider trading by the Noticees. There has been no material or allegation to even suggest as to how the Noticees have indulged in the alleged instances of insider trading. There is no basis or case made out in the SCN to even suggest as to how any alleged UPSI existed or the Noticees were in possession of the UPSI and how it is on the basis of such alleged UPSI, the trades were executed. On the contrary, the bonafide are writ large as the sale proceeds were entirely utilized for the purpose of repayment of loans to the banks as clearly supported by the facts/documents.  5.8 In case the Noticees were in possession of the UPSI about the possibility of the merger, they would have delayed the sale by a few days so as to fetch a higher price, as is evident that delay of sale by few days could have fetched an additional sum of INR 17 Crore (considering the price rose from INR 200 to INR 240 within 3 days of the announcement) to them. 5.9 The requirement of SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s obligation to prove and the standard of proof have been succinctly captured by the Hon'ble SAT in Dilip S. Pendse v SEBI (Appeal No. 80 of 2009, decided on November 19, 2009) and therefore, in light of settled law and__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of insider trading activities of certain entities in the scrip of Tree House Education and Accessories Ltd.                                       Page 5 of 33                       consistent approach by both the SEBI and the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, no case has been made out against the Noticee.   5.10 The decision to sell the shares was taken by the Noticees jointly in consultation with one another and therefore all allegations with imputing motives are false /incorrect and are denied. It cannot be alleged that the Noticee no. 1 has communicated the alleged UPSI to the Noticee no. 2 illegally. 5.11 Regulation 29(3) does not contemplate time limit for disclosure relating to sale of shares in excess of limits set out under regulation 29(2) of the Takeover Regulations as held by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in Ravi Mohan vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 97 of 2014, decided on December 16, 2015). The very fact that subsequently SEBI has amended the relevant regulation on September 11, 2018 makes it clear that there was no clarity as noted in the judgment of Rakesh Kathotia (supra).  5.12 Based on the aforesaid facts, there is no question of violation of Clause 6 of the Minimum Standards for Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Insiders as specified in Schedule B read with regulation 9(1) of the PIT Regulations. 5.13 There has been no disproportionate gain or unfair advantage as a result of the alleged trades in the shares of the Company. On the contrary assuming without admitting, if the shares were sold while in possession of UPSI then in fact, they caused themselves a loss of INR 20-45 per share i.e., a loss of INR 8 to 17 Crore approximately. Due to the alleged acts, no loss has been caused to any of the investors or group of investors and the same has not even been alleged in the SCN much less supported by any cogent evidence/document. Further, there is no allegation or case made out to suggest any default, let alone repetitive default. Therefore, taking into account the mandate of Section 15J of the SEBI Act, this is a fit case where no monetary penalty should be imposed.  6. The Noticee no. 1 along with common Authorized Representative appeared for the personal hearing through Video Conferencing on November 11, 2020 and made oral submissions on behalf of him and the Noticee no. 2 as well. Thereafter, the Noticees vide a covering letter dated January 12, 2021 have provided post hearing submissions dated January 08, 2021 wherein they have, inter alia, submitted as under: 6.1 The Noticee no. 1 had a meeting with Mr. Subhash Chandra Goel on November 30, 2015. In that meeting Mr. Subhash Chandra Goel agreed to buy a total number of 40 Lakh shares of the Company for a total consideration of INR 80.20 Crore. Mr. Chandra had at that time also offered to merge the two companies i.e., THEAL and ZLL.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of insider trading activities of certain entities in the scrip of Tree House Education and Accessories Ltd.                                       Page 6 of 33                       6.2 After the transaction for sale and purchase was completed on December 03, 2015, Mr. Subhash Chandra Goel called the Noticee no. 1 and again inquired whether the two companies can come together for their mutual business interest.  6.3 During the inspection held on July 31, 2020, inspection of only those documents which were relied upon in the SCN were provided, whereas during the hearing, although reference to some letters allegedly received from the 6 buyers were made, copies of the same were not provided to the Noticees.  6.4 The sale was made only with a purpose to repay the loans due to banks. In this regard, reliance is placed on the decision of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in Abhijit Rajan vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 232 of 2016, decided on November 8, 2019). 6.5 Shares were sold on December 03, 2015 in the Block Deal segment of the stock exchanges, which require certain meeting of mind between the buyer and seller for a trade to get executed, this substantiates the submission that those 6 buyers entities were of Mr. Subhash Chandra Goel, who were aware that the Noticees would be placing sell order of 40 Lakh shares of the Company. 6.6 The police complaints against Mr. Chandra and his associates were filed by the Noticee no. 1 on 3 occasions viz., March 22, 2016, December 15, 2016 and December 16, 2016. However, no FIR was registered by the Police at that time. FIR was registered by the Khar Police Station only after an order was passed by the Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, directing the Officer-in-Charge of Khar Police Station to register the complaint u/s 156(3) of Cr. P. C. as FIR and submit a Final Report after investigation. After investigation of one year, the Police filed a Summary Report before Metropolitan Magistrate Court, Bandra. Subsequently, a protest petition was also filed before the Metropolitan Magistrate and a complaint against the investigating officer and Sr. Police Officer before the State Police Complaint Authority (\\\\\\\\u201cSPCA\\\\\\\\u201d) for filing of false report in the court and for shielding the accused. Both the protest petitions and complaint before SPCA are presently pending for adjudication. CONSIDERATION  7. I have considered the allegations levelled against the Noticees in the SCN, written reply received from the Noticees, submissions made by the Noticees during the personal hearing, the written submissions filed post the personal hearing and the material available on record. Before dealing with the submissions made by the Noticees, it would be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of law pertaining to the matter, extract whereof is reproduced below:__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of insider trading activities of certain entities in the scrip of Tree House Education and Accessories Ltd.                                       Page 7 of 33                       The SEBI ACT, 1992 Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control. 12A. No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (d) engage in insider trading;    (e) deal in securities while in possession of material or non-public information or communicate such material or non-public information to any other person, in a manner which is in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; SEBI(PIT) Regulations, 2015  Trading when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information. 4.(1) No insider shall trade in securities that are listed or proposed to be listed on a stock exchange when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information: Explanation \\\\\\\\u2013When a person who has traded in securities has been in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, his trades would be presumed to have been motivated by the knowledge and awareness of such information in his possession. Provided that the insider may prove his innocence by demonstrating the circumstances including the following: \\\\\\\\u2013 (ii) the transaction was carried out through the block deal window mechanism between persons who were in possession of the unpublished price sensitive information without being in breach of regulation 3 and both parties had made a conscious and informed trade decision; Provided that such unpublished price sensitive information was not obtained by either person under sub-regulation (3) of regulation 3 of these regulations. NOTE: When a person who has traded in securities has been in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, his trades would be presumed to have been motivated by the knowledge and awareness of such information in his possession. The reasons for which he trades or the purposes to which he applies the proceeds of the transactions are not intended to be relevant for determining whether a person has violated the regulation. He traded when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information is what would need to be demonstrated at the outset to bring a charge. Once this is established, it would be open to the insider to prove his innocence by demonstrating the circumstances mentioned in the proviso, failing which he would have violated the prohibition. 8. Before proceeding to deal with the merits of the allegations levelled in the SCN, I find it appropriate to deal with certain preliminary issues raised by the Noticees contending that they have not been provided with copies of certain documents including the Investigation Report and that there is an inordinate delay in issuance of the present SCN. In this regard, it is noted__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of insider trading activities of certain entities in the scrip of Tree House Education and Accessories Ltd.                                       Page 8 of 33                       that the present proceedings have been initiated primarily to deal with the charge of indulging in insider trading. The charge of indulging in insider trading essentially warrants that the person or entity concerned needs to be first an insider in terms of the provisions of the PIT Regulations, who is in possession of or having access to an information, which is price sensitive in nature and which is not generally available till such time the same is disclosed for the consumption of public at large and the entity or person concerned (insider) has dealt/ traded in the scrip of the concerned company while in possession of the said price sensitive information, which is not otherwise available to other investors.  9. I further note that the outcome of the investigation conducted in this case has been duly captured in the form of allegations in the SCN and all the relevant documents that have been relied upon in the SCN have duly been annexed to the SCN as well as provided to the Noticees.  I further find that the relevant documents relied upon and referred to in the SCN comprise letters, applications, bank account statements, trading details, disclosures etc., of the Noticees which have either been provided by them or have been ascertained/obtained from the website of the stock exchanges which again, were provided to the stock exchanges either by the Noticees or the Company only. Therefore, in the absence of any specific prejudice supposed to have been caused to the Noticees in defending themselves against the allegations made in the SCN, I don\\\\\\\\u2019t find any merit in the contention of the Noticees stating that non-furnishing of the entire Investigation Report has rendered the Noticees incapacitated from defending themselves from the allegations made in the SCN.  10. In this regard, I also note that similar issue has also come up for consideration before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT\\\\\\\\u201d), wherein the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT vide its order dated February 12, 2020 passed in Appeal (L) No. 28 of 2020 \\\\\\\\u2013 Shruti Vora Vs. SEBI, has held as under: \\\\\\\\u201cIn the light of the aforesaid, we are of the opinion that concept of fairness and principles of natural justice are in-built in Rule 4 of the Rules of 1995 and that the AO is required to supply the documents relied upon while serving the show cause notice. This is essential for the person to file an efficacious reply in his defence.\\\\\\\\u201d     11. The aforesaid rulings made in the Shruti Vora\\\\\\\\u2019s case has been reiterated by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT  in its order dated July 17, 2020 passed in Appeal No. 150 of 2020-Anant R Sathe Vs. SEBI wherein it was held as under: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.8. The said principle elucidated in Shruti Vora\\\\\\\\u2019s judgement is squarely applicable in the instant case. The authority is required to supply the documents that they rely upon while serving the show__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of insider trading activities of certain entities in the scrip of Tree House Education and Accessories Ltd.                                       Page 9 of 33                       cause notice which in the instant case has been done and which is sufficient for the purpose of filing an efficacious reply in his defence\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d In the present case also, I find that the Noticees have already filed their detailed reply and written submissions to the SCN based on the contents of the documents relied upon therein and also annexed to the SCN for examination by the Noticees. The Noticees have not been able to make out a case as to how the non-receipt of the entire Investigation Report has caused a serious prejudice to their interest in defending themselves against the charges levelled in the SCN. Therefore, I find that the contentions of the Noticees in this regard are devoid of merit, not tenable and are thus liable to be rejected.  12. The Noticees have also contended that certain letters allegedly received from the 6 counter party buyers (to the sale of shares made by the Noticees on December 03, 2015) which were mentioned during the course of hearing have not been provided to them. In this respect, I note that the Noticees have admittedly taken a consistent view that they had no association or relation with their counter party buyers and have contended that the counter parties to their trades were not known entities. In the course of their personal hearing when the Noticees made an oral statement that the counter parties to their trades were persons or entities related or associated with Mr. Subhash Chadra Goel of ZEE group, it was pointed out to them that those counter party buyers have however submitted to SEBI during the investigation that they did not know either the Noticees or any of the present or past directors of ZLL. It was only in this context of the above, that a reference was made to the submissions made by the 6 counter party buyers and not otherwise to rely on those submissions as an evidence to further establish the charges already framed against the Noticees in the SCN. In any case, I find that those emails/letters received from the said 6 entities have not been relied upon in the proceedings against the Noticees and therefore, the grievance of the Noticees that the copies of those letters/communications have not been provided to them has no locus standi to be considered as a tenable demand. On the contrary, it clearly appears that the aforesaid grievance of the Noticees goes on to prove that the Noticees do not agree with the contentions of those counter party buyers during the investigation that they did not know the Noticees at all. The Noticees have rather sought to justify their acts by holding to their ground that they have sold the shares knowing very well that the counter party buyers were connected with ZLL who bought their shares pursuant to the discussions with Mr. Subhash Chadra Goel on November 30, 2015 and not otherwise. Under the circumstances, the submission of the Noticees that the alleged insider trading involving sale of 40 Lakh shares was indifferent to the UPSI and was effected only to meet the demand of lenders lead to contradiction and appear to be a specious claim that lacks__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of insider trading activities of certain entities in the scrip of Tree House Education and Accessories Ltd.                                       Page 10 of 33                       substance and is not supported by the facts and circumstances under which the trades have been executed by the Noticees.        13. It has been further contended that the present SCN has been issued with an inordinate delay of almost 4 years. To such a protest, I can state that there is no provision in the SEBI Act, 1992 which provides a limitation period for taking action against the violation of the provisions of the Act or the Regulations made thereunder. In terms of Section 24(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992, any contravention of the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the Rules and Regulations framed thereunder is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to the period of ten years. Thus, there is no time limitation prescribed in the SEBI Act, 1992 for the purpose of initiating action against violation of the provisions of law under the SEBI Act, 1992 and Rules and Regulations made thereunder. The issues pertaining to delay in initiating action have also been a subject matter of scrutiny of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT as well as before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India from time to time. It is a trite law that in the absence of any provision providing for a statutory limitation, such power needs to be exercised within a reasonable time and what constitutes a reasonable time, would depend upon the facts and circumstances specific to a case including the nature of the default/statute, prejudice caused, whether any third-party right has been created etc.  14. In the instant matter, I note that the transaction pertains to the period of November- December 2015, into which the investigation was initiated after the receipt of complaints. During the course of the investigation the allegations made in the complaints filed with SEBI had to be examined in detail and information has to be collected thereon from various sources. The information so collected were analyzed, based on which the SCN was issued on February 17, 2020 in the present proceedings after obtaining due approval of the Competent Authority in January 2020. Thus, from the foregoing narration of sequence of events that ensued pursuant to receipt of the complaint against the Noticees, I note that given the specific facts & circumstances of this case there has been no perceptible delay committed by SEBI in issuing the SCN to the Noticees hence, I find there is no merit in the complain of the Noticees about undue delay in issuance of SCN from SEBI and the said contention is liable to be rejected.  15. Having dealt with the aforesaid preliminary objections to the present proceedings raised by the Noticees, I proceed now to deal with the case on its merits. I note from the SCN that the main allegation against the Noticees is that they being \\\\\\\\u201cinsiders\\\\\\\\u201d have traded in the shares of the Company while in possession of UPSI and therefore have acted in violation of Section 12A(d) & (e) of the SEBI Act, 1992 and regulation 4(1) of the PIT Regulations. It is alleged that the corporate announcement made by the Company on December 04, 2015 relating to__________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of insider trading activities of certain entities in the scrip of Tree House Education and Accessories Ltd.                                       Page 11 of 33                       consolidation/merger options with ZLL, prior to its disclosure to the stock exchanges on December 04, 2015, was an UPSI and accordingly the period of UPSI was observed to be starting from November 30, 2015 to December 04, 2015 08:48 AM. 16. I note that the PIT Regulations have been formulated under Section 30 read with Section 11(2)(g) and Sections 12A(d) and (e) of the SEBI Act, 1992. Therefore, to ascertain as to whether the Noticees have violated the provisions, as alleged in the SCN, it has to be determined whether the Noticees have violated regulation 4(1) of the PIT Regulations, and if it is so, it will also amount to violation of Section 12A(d) and (e) of the SEBI Act, 1992. 17. As noted above, a perusal of the provisions governing insider trading activities reveals that regulation 4(1) of the PIT Regulations pre-supposes the following essential ingredients to be present and be satisfied to allege and establish the allegation of insider trading. These essential ingredients or pre-conditions are as under: a. Noticees must be insider;  b. There must be an UPSI in existence; c. The insider must have traded in the securities of the company when in possession of such UPSI. However, proviso to regulation 4(1) envisages certain special circumstances wherein despite the presence of all the aforesaid ingredients, an insider may be able to prove his/her innocence and seek exemptions from the rigors of allegations of insider trading by demonstrating that he/she had to indulge in trading in the shares of the company while in possession of UPSI due to certain unavoidable circumstances which are mentioned in the said proviso. The Note to regulation 4(1) states that once it is established that an insider has traded in the scrip of the company when in possession of UPSI, it would be open to the insider to prove his/her innocence by demonstrating that the trades had to be executed under the circumstances mentioned in the proviso thereunder, failing which he/she would be deemed to have violated the prohibitions mandated for the insiders in terms of the provisions of the", "Date": "2021-05-24", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Order in the matter of Tree House Education and Accessories Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/may-2021/order-in-the-matter-of-tree-house-education-and-accessories-limited_50257.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 62868, "unique_record_id": "eb91c06c18SEBI20210524", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6682105f7858910306472f60", "parse_date": "2024-07-01 02:11:04", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Insider Trading", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "INR 8,00,00,000", "gpt_audience": "- Regulatory authorities\n- Legal professionals\n- Investors and shareholders of Tree House Education and Accessories Ltd.\n- Corporate governance experts\n- Financial analysts\n- Compliance officers\n- Media and financial journalists\n- Academics and students in finance and law\n- Employees and management of Tree House Education and Accessories Ltd.\n- General public interested in corporate ethics and insider trading cases", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

Ltd\\\\\\\\u201d) in the matter of Tata Finance Limited Page 2 of 57   2. Pursuant to a complaint received from Tata Finance Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cTFL\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cCompany\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI conducted an investigation in the transaction in shares of TFL during the period from September 2000 to April 2001. The investigation inter alia alleged that MSS, a SEBI registered broker and a member of BSE, gave antedated contract notes in Form B to the sellers i.e. Mrs. Anuradha Pendse (hereinafter referred also as \\\\\\\\u201cAnuradha\\\\\\\\u201d), Nalini Properties Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNPPL\\\\\\\\u201d), Anjudi Property & Investment Pvt. Ltd.

Further MSS issued antedated contract notes in Form - B to ultimate buyers of the shares, India Emerging Company Investment Ltd (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIECIL\\\\\\\\u201d) for off market transaction of 1,40,000 shares of TFL. Investigation alleged that MSS have done the back dating and falsification of contract notes, bills and books of accounts to show that these transactions in the shares of TFL had taken place during September 2000, though the transactions were actually entered in March 2001. Further, during the investigation it was also alleged that MSS had assisted, aided and abetted Mrs. Anuradha Pendse, NPPL, APIPL and Dr. Anjali Beke in insider trading and in causing wrongful loss to IECIL.  3. Based on the findings of the investigation, SEBI initiated enquiry proceedings against MSS in terms of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Enquiry by Enquiry Officer and imposing Penalty) Regulations, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cEnquiry Regulations, 2002\\\\\\\\u201d). An Enquiry Officer was appointed to enquire into the alleged violations of various provisions of the SEBI (Stock Brokers & Sub Brokers) Regulations, 1992, (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cBrokers Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPIT Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) and SEBI Circulars. Accordingly, a show cause notice dated July 21, 2003 was issued to MSS by the Enquiry Officer.   ENQUIRY REPORT:___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of MSS Securities Private Limited (Formerly known as \\\\\\\\u201cMalini Sanghvi Securities Pvt. Ltd\\\\\\\\u201d) in the matter of Tata Finance Limited Page 3 of 57  4. After concluding the enquiry, in terms of Regulation 13(1) of Enquiry Regulations, 2002 the Enquiry Officer had submitted the Enquiry Report dated August 08, 2005 in respect of MSS, wherein the Enquiry Officer had found that MSS have violated the certain provisions of SEBI Circular and recommended a minor penalty of censure against MSS.   5. Allegation before Enquiry Officer: The allegation made against broker, MSS in the Enquiry Report are inter alia as under:  5.1. It is alleged that the broker, MSS had issued contract notes in Form B dated September 11, 2000 whereby Mrs. Anuradha Pendse, NPPL, Dr. Anjali Bake and APIPL are shown to have sold, 10,000, 30,000, 20,000 and 80,000 shares of TFL respectively to the broker, MSS at a price of Rs. 90/- per share and the broker had also issued contract notes of the same date in Form B whereby IECIL is shown to have purchased 1,40,000 shares from the broker at a price of Rs.90/- per share. It is also alleged that there was no corresponding credit or debit entry in the broker\\\\\\\\u2019s neither demat account or that of the buyers or sellers for the aforesaid transactions nor was there any payments made by the broker to the seller or receipt of funds by the broker. Therefore it is alleged that the broker had issued fictitious contract notes without there being actual transaction in contravention of Regulation 6(d) of PFUTP Regulations, 1995.  5.2. Thus, it is further alleged that for the transactions mentioned in table below, the broker did not issue any contract notes in violation of Clause B(2) of the Code of Conduct specified in Schedule II, read with Regulation 7 of Broker Regulations. It is also alleged that these transactions were not executed on the screen based trading system of BSE in violation of SEBI Circular No. SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-32/99 dated September 14, 1999.

Ltd\\\\\\\\u201d) in the matter of Tata Finance Limited Page 4 of 57  Dr. Anjali Beke TFL 20,000 90 28.03.01 Rs. 13.5 lakhs - 02.04.01,  Rs. 4.5 lakhs - April 01 APIPL TFL 80,000 90 28.03.01 March 01 (end Total    1,40,000         5.3. It is alleged that aforesaid transactions were not reported to BSE is in violation of SEBI Circular No. SMD/RCG/CIR/(BKG)/293/95 dated March 14, 1995. Besides, the broker failed to obtain written consent from the clients for acting as principal for the aforesaid transactions in violation of SEBI Circular dated October 29, 1993 read with Regulation 17(1)(j) of Broker Regulations, 1992 especially when the price of the scrip was between Rs.39 and 43/- during the period March 28-31, 2001 in BSE. It is alleged that payment to the client was not made within the stipulated period in violation of Clause B(1) of the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II read with Regulation 7 of Broker Regulations and Circular dated November 18, 1993.  5.4. It is alleged that Mr. Dilip Pendse being an insider and connected person knew about the poor financial position of TFL on account of losses incurred by Niskalp Investment and Trading Company Ltd (NITC) a wholly owned subsidiary of TFL even before the said information was made public on April 30, 2001 and communicated this unpublished price sensitive information to broker, MSS. It is alleged that MSS had assisted, aided and abetted Mrs. Anuradha Pendse, NPPL, APIPL and Dr. Anjali Beke in insider trading. Therefore, it is alleged that MSS has violated Regulation 3(i) of PIT Regulations.  6. Finding in Enquiry Report: The findings mentioned against broker, MSS in the Enquiry Report are inter alia as under: 6.1. The contract notes and bills thereto were issued on September 11, 2000 and September 16, 2000 respectively. The BSE was informed of the transaction on September 16, 2000. The payment and deliveries were completed on March 28, 2001 when the parties to the contract have fulfilled their respective obligations. There is no dispute between the parties on the delay in settlement of the contract. The parties have accepted payments and effected deliveries. Merely because, there is delay in consummation of the contract___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of MSS Securities Private Limited (Formerly known as \\\\\\\\u201cMalini Sanghvi Securities Pvt. Ltd\\\\\\\\u201d) in the matter of Tata Finance Limited Page 5 of 57  entered into by and between the parties, it would be difficult to conclude that the contracts themselves were fictitious ones. It is not the case that the broker has issued contract notes twice for the same transactions. The broker has informed the stock exchange about the impugned transactions on September 16, 2000. However, there appears to be some delay in informing the same to BSE and the BSE vide its letter dated March 11, 2004 has warned the broker to be careful in future. 6.2. It is not disputed that the contract notes were issued on September 11, 2000 for the impugned transactions. Bills thereto were also issued by the broker on September 16, 2000. BSE was also informed of the transactions by the brokers Letter dated September 16, 2000. There was considerable delay in settlement of the transactions until March 28, 2001 when the shares were delivered by the selling clients and consequently payments were made to the buying clients. There is no dispute by and between the buying and selling parties to the contract with respect to their respective obligation. Therefore, it cannot be said that the broker had issued fictitious contract notes. However, there is definitely an irregularity in the issuance of contract notes in Form-B which the broker had admitted. 6.3. Since the impugned transactions have been reported to BSE vide letter dated September 16, 2000 of the broker, it cannot be concluded that there is violation of SEBI circular SMD/RCG/CIR/(BKG)/293/95 dated March 14, 1995. 6.4. To the allegation that the broker has assisted, aided and abetted Mrs. Anuradha Pendse, NPPL, APIPL and Dr Anjali Beke in insider trading, there is no sufficient evidence to suggest that the broker had knowingly assisted the clients in their alleged insider trading. It is not the case that the broker himself had traded in securities of TFL based on unpublished price sensitive information in violation of Regulation 3(i) of SEBI (Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992. In the absence of any such material to suggest that the broker had derived any undue advantage by executing such transaction except that of normal brokerage, the allegation that the broker had aided and abetted his clients for their insider trading is not conclusively established.  6.5. The aforesaid transactions have not been done on the screen based trading system of BSE which is in violation of SEBI Circular No. SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-32/99 dated September 14, 1999 and also cannot be termed as 'hand delivery' contracts as per Bye-law 48(ii) of BSE Byelaws as the delivery is not affected within 7 days from the date of___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of MSS Securities Private Limited (Formerly known as \\\\\\\\u201cMalini Sanghvi Securities Pvt. Ltd\\\\\\\\u201d) in the matter of Tata Finance Limited Page 6 of 57  contract. It also cannot be said that these transaction are not spot delivery contracts permitted under the SCR Act, 1956. The violation of SEBI Circular dated September 14, 1999 in as much as the transactions have not been executed on the screen of the exchange is established. Further, issuance of Form-B contracts by the broker for these transactions is also not in order. There was delay in reporting the transactions to BSE for which the broker was warned by BSE. However, the stock exchange issued a warning to the broker through Disciplinary Action Committee of the exchange.   7. Recommendation in Enquiry Report: The recommendation made against broker, MSS in Enquiry report are as under: 7.1. Having regard to the nature and gravity of the charges established, the submissions made and in view of the case law discussed, it is recommended that a minor penalty of censure may be considered against M/s MSS Securities Private Limited (formerly Known as Malini Sanghvi Securities Private Limited) member BSE in terms of Regulation 13(1)(a)(i) of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Enquiry by Enquiry Officer and Imposing Penalty) Regulations, 2002.  POST ENQUIRY SHOW CAUSE NOTICE: 8. Pursuant to the submission of Enquiry Report dated August 08, 2005, in respect of MSS by the Enquiry Officer, SEBI issued a post enquiry Show Cause Notice dated October 03, 2005 enclosing a copy of Enquiry Report dated August 08, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cEnquiry Report\\\\\\\\u201d) under Regulation 13(2) of Enquiry Regulations, 2002, to MSS wherein MSS was advised to reply to the SCN within 21 days from the date of receipt of said notice. The said SCN was delivered to MSS on October 03, 2005. The proof of delivery is available on record.   REPLY TO POST ENQUIRY SCN: 9. MSS vide its letter dated October 20, 2005, had submitted its reply to the SCN dated October 03, 2005. The reply of MSS in brief are as under:___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of MSS Securities Private Limited (Formerly known as \\\\\\\\u201cMalini Sanghvi Securities Pvt. Ltd\\\\\\\\u201d) in the matter of Tata Finance Limited Page 7 of 57  9.1. With reference to the allegation that the transaction referred to in the Enquiry Notice was one on principal to principal basis, as the contract format used was Form B, Enquiry Officer has absolved MSS. Enquiry Officer finding establishes MSS contention that they had not done any proprietary trading but only traded for the clients and that Form B was inadvertently issued. The Enquiry Officer has come to the conclusion that MSS had not done any trading on a principal to principal basis and issuance of Form B Contract was only a procedural irregularity. Since Enquiry Officer has not viewed the same as an offence, therefore it is submitted that no penalty is called for. 9.2. The Enquiry Officer has observed that since the impugned transactions have been reported to BSE vide letter dated 16.9.2000, it cannot be concluded that there is violation of SEBI Circular SMD/RCG/CIR/BKG/293/95 dated 14.3.95. With reference to the alleged delayed reporting of the transaction to BSE, Enquiry Officer has also noted that since BSE has already issued a warning, therefore it is submitted that no further penalty is called for again. 9.3. It is submitted that the said transactions were \\\\\\\\u201chand delivery\\\\\\\\u201d bargains as provided for under the byelaws of BSE. The requirement of bye law 48(ii) of BSE bye laws is that \\\\\\\\u201cfor hand delivery i.e. for delivery and payment within the time or on the date stipulated when entering into the bargain...\\\\\\\\u201d. MSS had fulfilled the said requirement by stipulating the requisite timeframe for settlement while issuing the contract notes / bills. The settlement period mentioned was 09.09.2000 to 16.09.2000 on the contract notes & bills. Thus, it was clear that the transactions were to be completed within the stipulated time frame. The constituents delayed performing their obligations. As per byelaw 48(ii) relating to \\\\\\\\u201cBargains\\\\\\\\u201d reads as follows: \\\\\\\\u201cfor hand delivery\\\\\\\\u201d, i.e. for delivery and payment within the time or on the date stipulated when entering into the bargain, which time or date shall not be more than fourteen days following the date of the contract.\\\\\\\\u201d 9.4. For the said contracts when entered into, the settlement period is mentioned as 09.09.2000 to 16.09.2000, which was not more than 14 days as stipulated in bye law 48(ii). 9.5. Further such off the floor transactions, were not barred or prohibited as per Rules, Bye laws or Regulations of BSE. The said transactions were reported to BSE. Therefore, it is erroneous to hold that MSS have violated SEBI Circular SMDRP/POLICY/CIR-32/99 dated September 14, 1999. In any case, the said circular applies to Negotiated Deals but does not have the effect of taking away what is permitted and contemplated in Byelaw 48(ii) of the Rules, Byelaws, and Regulations of BSE. Further, as per the said circular, Negotiated Deals to be executed on the screens of the exchanges in the price and order matching mechanism of the exchanges. 9.6. Further, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the case of Ex-Naik Sardar Singh V. Union of India (1991) 3 SCC 212 has inter alia held that \\\\\\\\u201cthe penalty imposed must be___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of MSS Securities Private Limited (Formerly known as \\\\\\\\u201cMalini Sanghvi Securities Pvt. Ltd\\\\\\\\u201d) in the matter of Tata Finance Limited Page 8 of 57  commensurate with the gravity of the misconduct and that any penalty disproportionate to the gravity of the misconduct would be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution\\\\\\\\u201d. It is submitted that, in the light of the principle laid down by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court the minor penalty of censure for technical and procedural violation is very harsh in the facts and circumstances of the instant case. In this regard MSS may also invite attention to the order dated 31.08.04 passed by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Reliance Industries Ltd vs. SEBI.  SUPPLEMENTARY SHOW CAUSE NOTICE: 10. While these proceedings were pending, the Enquiry Regulations, 2002 were repealed on May 26, 2008, by Intermediaries Regulations 2008.  Accordingly, the Designated Member continued with the proceedings in terms of Regulation 28 read with 38(2) of the Intermediaries Regulations 2008 and Regulation 13 of the Enquiry Regulations, 2002.  11. Subsequently, the Designated Member after considering the recommendation in the Enquiry Report dated August 08, 2005 submitted to him along with show cause notice dated July 21, 2003 issued by the Enquiry Officer, was of the view that there are certain additional / other facts which are found fit for consideration and which have not been considered by the Enquiry Officer while making recommendations in his report. Therefore, SEBI had issued a Supplementary Show Cause Notice dated January 19, 2012 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) to MSS. Vide the said SSCN, MSS was informed that SSCN was issued under Regulation 28(1) read with Regulation 38(2) of Intermediaries Regulations in continuation of SCN dated October 03, 2005. Further, MSS was also called upon to show cause as to why higher penalty as considered appropriate should not be imposed in terms of Regulation 28(1) read with Regulation 38(2) of Intermediaries Regulations in respect of the transactions executed by MSS in the shares of TFL.   12. The allegation mentioned in SSCN in brief are as under: 12.1. MSS have reported the impugned transactions to BSE in September 2000 vide letter dated September 16, 2000, to BSE enclosing 5 contract notes executed by them in Form B, bearing nos. GB01/1, GB01/2, GB01/3, GB01/4 and GB01/5. On the examination of MSS letter sent to BSE on September 16, 2000, following has been noted by the Designated Member and alleged in SSCN:___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of MSS Securities Private Limited (Formerly known as \\\\\\\\u201cMalini Sanghvi Securities Pvt. Ltd\\\\\\\\u201d) in the matter of Tata Finance Limited Page 9 of 57  12.1.1. That the date and time of receipt is absent in the place provided for the same in the acknowledgment seal.  12.1.2. That the date \\\\\\\\u201819/9/2000\\\\\\\\u2019 is handwritten on the said letter with the initial, outside the space provided for in the acknowledgment seal.  12.1.3. The contract notes are printed, its sub-serial number is observed to be hand written in few instances.  12.1.4. The case is that Mrs. Anuradha Pendse, NPPL, APIPL and Dr. Anjali Beke sold the shares of TFL to MSS. However, these contract notes shows that the transactions of Mrs. Anuradha Pendse, NPPL, APIPL and Dr. Anjali Beke were entered under the column \\\\\\\\u2018Securities SOLD To you for\\\\\\\\u2019 and in the case of IECIL the transaction was mentioned under the column \\\\\\\\u2018Securities BOUGHT FROM you for\\\\\\\\u2019.  12.1.5. The serial numbers of these contract notes reveal that prior to selling 1,40,000 shares to IECIL, MSS had bought total 30,000 shares from Mrs. Anuradha Pendse and Dr. Anjali Beke and 1,10,000 shares were bought by MSS after selling 1,40,000 shares to IECIL. MSS could not have sold 1,40,000 shares of TFL [Contract Note No. GB01/3] to IECIL, when only 30,000 shares of TFL were available [Contract Note Nos.GB01/1 (for 10,000 shares) and GB01/2 (for 20,000 shares)].  12.2. From the Ledger statement of Mrs. Anuradha Pendse maintained by MSS, it is noted that there was a credit amount of Rs.9,00,000/- on September 16, 2000, towards Bill No. 201003. However, the corresponding debit was recorded only on March 30, 2001. This kind of delay is abnormal and shows that the sale of the shares of TFL by Mrs. Anuradha Pendse had taken place in March, 2001 and not September, 2000. 12.3. From the Ledger statement of NPPL for the financial year 2000-01, following is noted: 12.3.1. Rs.27,00,000/- was credited by MSS to the account of NPPL on September 16, 2000, by Bill No.201006 / ZGBO1. However, there is no mention of any date of receipt of actual payment for the said credit entry by NPPL from MSS. 12.3.2.  Additional credit was advanced to the account of NPPL vide Bill Nos. 200001/ZGFC2, 200003/ZGFC3 and 200001/ZGFC4 dated 9/09/2000, 10/09/2000 and 11/09/2000 respectively to the tune of Rs.18,12,941.99/-, Rs.13,13,006.82/- and Rs.2,05,726.38/- respectively. The consequent payment for these credit entries were received in the month of September 2000 itself vide PYMT No. 317/ZBCO8, PYMT No. 320/ZBCO8 and PYMT No. 321/ZBCO8 for the corresponding amounts as mentioned above.  12.3.3. MSS received Rs.50,00,000/- from NPPL which was shown as a credit entry on December 20, 2000 in MSS books. There is no valid explanation for NPPL to have paid Rs.50,00,000/- to MSS in December 2000 when a due of Rs.27,00,000/- was outstanding from MSS side since September 16, 2000.___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of MSS Securities Private Limited (Formerly known as \\\\\\\\u201cMalini Sanghvi Securities Pvt. Ltd\\\\\\\\u201d) in the matter of Tata Finance Limited Page 10 of 57  This shows that the transactions in shares of TFL shown to have taken place in September, 2000, were not genuine and actual transactions have taken place in March, 2001. 12.4. That these transactions pertain to the financial year 2000-2001, whereas the BSE Disciplinary Committee minutes are dated March 12, 2003. The contract notes relied upon by the Disciplinary Action Committee suffers from several discrepancies.  12.5. With regard to the sale of shares of TFL by Mrs. Anuradha Pendse, she had claimed a taxable gain of Rs. 6,05,199/- on sale of 10,000 TFL shares. For the sale of shares in September 2000 as claimed by her, Mrs. Anuradha Pendse was required to pay advance tax on the capital gains by September 15, 2000 or December 15, 2000 as applicable. It is noted that no advance tax was paid during the financial year 2000-01 and interest of Rs. 44,057 u/s 234B of the Income Tax Act, 1961 was paid for default on payment of advance tax and a sum of Rs. 31,754 was paid u/s 234C of the said Act towards interest for deferment of advance tax. The fact that Mrs Anuradha S Pendse did not pay advance tax in respect of sale of TFL shares in December 2000 strengthens the allegations that the transaction happened after December, 2000.  12.6. Thus, on the basis of above ground, it was alleged in the SSCN that MSS have issued backdated / fictitious contract notes to show that the transactions have taken place in September, 2000 instead of March 2001, and thus assisted, aided and abetted in insider trading.  REPLY TO SSCN:  13. MSS vide its letter dated March 20, 2012, had submitted its reply to the SSCN dated January 19, 2012. Vide said reply, MSS had requested for the inspection of documents and cross examination of Mr. R.V. Ramanujan, Mr. P.B. Bandvedkar, Mr. Dilip Pendse, Dr. Anjali Beke, Mrs. Anuradha Pendse, SEBI officers who visited them on January 19, 2002, and any other person whose statement is relied upon by SEBI. The reply of MSS in brief are as under: 13.1. MSS denied the allegation made in the SSCN dated January 19, 2012, and SCN dated October 03, 2005.  13.2. The SSCN was issued after a passage of almost 6 years from the date of filing of their reply dated October 20, 2005, to the SCN dated October 03, 2005. The Enquiry Regulations, 2002 under which SCN dated October 03, 2005, was issued requires the Chairman or Member to pass such order within one hundred and twenty days from the date of receipt of reply to the SCN, which SEBI evidently failed to pass even after a passage of more than 6 years from the date of reply to the SCN. The inordinate and inexplicable delay of 6 years is in contradiction to applicable regulations and also in violation of Principles of Natural Justice.___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of MSS Securities Private Limited (Formerly known as \\\\\\\\u201cMalini Sanghvi Securities Pvt. Ltd\\\\\\\\u201d) in the matter of Tata Finance Limited Page 11 of 57  13.3. The investigation into the same transactions was also conducted by BSE. Based on its investigations, the Disciplinary Action Committee (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cDAC\\\\\\\\u201d) of BSE, after considering all the facts and circumstance of the matter, only issued warning to MSS.  13.4. Further, the issue involved in the SSCN is no more res-integra, since the same has been already decided by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cHon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT\\\\\\\\u201d) vide its order dated November 19, 2009, in Appeal no. 80 of 2009, wherein Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT has given a categorical finding that the transactions were not backdated. In the light of the findings of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, which as matter of Judicial discipline are binding on SEBI, the charges / allegation in the SCN do not survive. INSPECTION OF DOCUMENTS:  14. From the reply of MSS, it is noted that MSS had sought for the inspection of documents. From the documents available on record, I find that SEBI had provided the opportunity of inspection of documents to MSS multiple times and the same was finally availed by MSS on January 24, 2017. The details in this regard are as under:  Table No. 2 Date of MSS letter seeking Inspection   Date of SEBI Inspection Notice  Date of Inspection  Date of MSS letter requesting  adjournment of Inspection  Opportunity of Inspection availed or not March 20, 2012 June 15, 2012 May 18, 2012 June 06, 2012   Adjourned, due to Administrative Exigencies June 21, 2012 July 06, 2012 July 03, 2012 Adjourned, on request of MSS  December 16, 2016 December 22, 2016 December 20, 2016 Adjourned, on request of MSS  December 26, 2016 January 06, 2017 December 30, 2016 Adjourned, on request of MSS  January 10, 2017 January 24, 2017   Yes, availed on January 24, 2017    CROSS EXAMINATION:___________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of MSS Securities Private Limited (Formerly known as \\\\\\\\u201cMalini Sanghvi Securities Pvt.

Thus, the period from January 24, 2017 to March 14, 2017 is determined as the UPSI period.  4.

Adjudication Order in respect of IVL and Mr. Lalit Sharma in the matter of Indiabulls Venture Limited        Page 9 of 30  b. The Company, Noticee No. 1 in its reply dated May 03, 2018 to SEBI stated that the trading window was not required to be closed and therefore not closed in connection with the deal i.e. sale of ILPL to IIL, announced on March 14, 2017, as the information about the proposed sale was available in public domain from June 20, 2016.  c. However, the submissions made by the Company with respect to non-closure of trading window was not accepted due to the following reasons:  i. The Company in its reply dated May 15, 2018 mentioned that no formal/informal proposal was made or interest evinced by any entity for purchasing ILPL till March 07, 2017. Further, it was observed from the reply dated May 03, 2018 of the Company and statement recording of CEO of the Company dated May 30, 2018 that real estate market was sluggish and not conducive at that time.  ii. Considering the above, despite the fact that the Company had announced its intention to sell investment in ILPL on June 20, 2016, it was crucial to find a suitable buyer and finalize the consideration to execute their intention.  iii. The information regarding finalization / identification of the buyer and the actual event of signing of the definitive agreement to sell 100% shareholding in ILPL, to IIL, is considered to be material information.  iv. Hence, the major development or announcement dated March 14, 2017 relating to identifying a buyer, finalizing the consideration and the actual event of signing of the definitive agreement to sell 100% shareholding in ILPL, to IIL is a UPSI.  v. Therefore, the Company was under the obligation to close the trading window with respect to the UPSI announced on March 14, 2017.  6. As detailed in para 3(i) above, it was observed that period of UPSI was from January 24, 2017 to March 14, 2017 and therefore, the aforementioned submissions by the Noticees No. 1 and 2 with regard to UPSI were found tenable.  7.

In view of the above, the Company had the responsibility to notify the period of closure of trading window and the compliance officer of the Company had the responsibility to monitor adherence to the same. It was observed that the trading window was not notified and closed during the UPSI period, therefore, it was alleged that the Company, Noticee No. 1 and its compliance officer, Mr. Lalit Sharma, Noticee No. 2 have violated Clause 4 of the Minimum Standards for Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Insiders as specified in Schedule B read with Regulation 9(1) of the PIT Regulations and Clause (V) of the Company Code of Conduct adopted for Prevention of Insider Trading.

Further, in the interim order, the activities of the Noticees were prima facie found to be fraudulent and manipulative and in violation of provisions of Section 12A (a), (b) & (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations 3 (b), (c) & (d) and Regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations, 2003). By the interim order, following directions were issued against the Noticees: Final Order in the matter of ALGO Solution (Proprietor: Shri Piyush Porwal)  Page 2 of 12  i The Noticees shall cease and desist from acting as an investment advisor including the activity of acting and representing through any media (physical or digital) as an investment advisor, directly or indirectly, and cease to solicit or undertake such activity or any other activities in the securities market, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, until further orders.    ii The Noticees shall not access the securities market and buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, until further orders.      iii The Noticees shall not divert any funds raised from investors, kept in bank account(s) and/or in their custody until further orders.    iv The Noticees  shall not  dispose of or alienate any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge on any of assets held in their name, including money lying in bank accounts except with the prior permission of SEBI.     v The Noticees shall immediately withdraw and remove all advertisements, representations, literatures, brochures, materials, publications, documents, websites, communications etc., in relation to their investment advisory activity or any other unregistered activity in the securities market until further orders.    vi The Noticees shall provide a full inventory of all assets held in the name of the proprietorship or the proprietor and firm or the partner, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge on any of such assets, including details of all bank accounts, demat accounts and mutual fund investments, immediately but not later than 5 working days from the date of receipt of this order.    vii Any person while working under the above mentioned Noticees as employee or otherwise, shall cease and desist from undertaking the activity of investment advisory services, including the activity of acting and representing through any media (physical or digital) as an investment advisor, directly or indirectly, till further orders.    viii The Banks are directed not to allow any debits/ withdrawals from or credits to the accounts of the Noticees, held jointly or severally, without the permission of SEBI.

Final Order in the matter of ALGO Solution (Proprietor: Shri Piyush Porwal)  Page 3 of 12   2. The interim order was also in the nature of a show cause notice wherein the Noticees were provided with the opportunity to file their objections/reply, if any, within 21 days from the date of the interim order and were also provided with an opportunity of personal hearing before SEBI, on a date and time to be fixed on a specific request to be made by the Noticees, in that regard. In this regard, it is noted that the Noticees have neither filed any reply/objections to the interim order nor sought any personal hearing. Hence, I shall now proceed to determine the matter ex-parte and on the basis of material available on record.   3. I find that the interim order passed in the matter contained following observations with respect to the Noticees:  (i) SEBI received an email dated September 26, 2019 from Mr. Adarsh Deep Sachan (\\\\\\\\u2018Complainant\\\\\\\\u2019), inter alia, alleging that he has paid Rs. 53,000 to the ALGO Solution in two different accounts i.e., Axis Bank and HDFC Bank, bearing account no. 919020004111460 and 50200041715722, respectively. However, they are forcing him to pay more money.  (ii) With the aforesaid email, Mr. Adarsh Deep Sachan has also attached payment receipt in connection to payment made to ALGO Solution.  (iii) Vide email dated September 25, 2019, HDFC Bank was requested to furnish copies of the AOF, KYC details and bank statements available with the bank (from opening till the date of the email) for them for ALGO Solution.  (iv) HDFC Bank vide email dated September 27, 2019, inter alia, forwarded the bank accounts statement for ALGO Solution. From the HDFC Bank account statement of ALGO Solution, it is observed that around Rs.9,49,855/- have been credited during the period July 1, 2019 to September 24, 2019.  (v) Axis Bank vide email dated September 26, 2019, inter alia, forwarded the bank accounts statement for ALGO Solution.

The Beneficiary details are as under:  Name Piyush Porwal Email PIYUSH.PORWAL34@GMAIL.COM Bank Details HDFC Bank Account No. 50200041715722 Commerce House, Race Course Road, Indore PAN Not Available Business Name Algo Solution  Name Piyush Porwal Email PIYUSH.PORWAL34@GMAIL.COM Bank Details Axis Bank Account No. 919020004111460 A.

(vii) An internet search made in the name of \\\\\\\\u2018Algo Solution\\\\\\\\u2019 showed its website http://algosolution.in. It is seen from the website that ALGO Solution has mentioned on the website that, \\\\\\\\u201cAlgo Solution, A trusted name in the financial services group, provides you with the entire gamut of financial services under one ceiling.

From the details of transactions processed through payment gateways, account statements of the relevant bank accounts, KYC records of bank accounts/ payment gateways, material available on the websites of the Noticees and the material submitted by the Complainant along with her complaint, interim order made the  following prima facie observations:   a. Noticees are not registered as investment advisors with SEBI. b. The Noticees have floated their website viz: http://algosolution.in.   c. The activity of Noticees, through their website, of holding themselves out to be giving advice  / recommendation  in  relation  to  securities  being  traded  in  the  securities market  and  /  or  also  in  relation  to  commodities  and  forex to  the  investors  and general public, and payment receipts of the complainants indicating the payment was  made  for  receiving  investment  advice,  the  bank  statement prima  facie, showing  the  credit inter  alia for  payment  of  fees,  indicates  that  there  is  a preponderance of probability that Noticees, apart from holding themselves out as investment advisor(s), have acted as an investment advisor for consideration. d. The website of the Noticees was live and running, as on the date of the interim order, and also reflect the bank account details/payment gateway through which the investors  desirous  of availing their services can make direct payment.  e. Payment gateways such as PayUmoney, Paytm, etc. and direct transfers to bank accounts reflected  on  the  website were  used  for  receiving  payments inter  alia towards subscription fee/product purchase from investors.  f. Continuous  credits  have  been  received  in  the  accounts  of  these  unregistered Noticees.  5. I note that the definition of investment adviser, as given in Regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, 2013, provides that investment adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients Final Order in the matter of ALGO Solution (Proprietor: Shri Piyush Porwal)  Page 6 of 12  or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations defines investment advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d   6. I note that Noticees on their website i.e. http://algosolution.in represented that Algo Solution, is a trusted name in the financial services group which provides investors with the entire gamut of financial services under one ceiling. From the Business License of Algo Solution, as provided by the Axis Bank vide its email dated September 26, 2019, inter alia, I find that Algo Solution is proprietorship/ownership concern of Shri Piyush Porwal. Noticees on their website also represented that Algo Solutions is one of the few organizations which provide research and information on Indian capital markets mainly based on Technical Analysis and enjoys a strong reputation among investors, brokers and researchers. Representation also stated that team of Algo Solution is highly skilled with experienced analysis, their efforts are to provide investors more & more profit in every trade, Algo Solution is providing help to investors to grow in their financial position by Short-Term investing or Trading in Indian Stock Market, investors can choose from Algo Solution\\\\\\\\u2019s flexible packages which are suitable to everybody, as per their requirement, Algo Solution provide trade alerts via sms every day and live tips and Algo Solution also offers recommendations in Cash, Futures, Index, Bullions, Metals and Energy. I note that following pricing details for availing various services were mentioned on the website of the Noticees:   Monthly Quarterly Half Yearly Yearly Stock Cash 10,000 20,000 35,000 60,000 Stock Future 15,000 25,000 40,000 70,000 Options 15,000 25,000 40,000 70,000 Final Order in the matter of ALGO Solution (Proprietor: Shri Piyush Porwal)  Page 7 of 12  Base Metals Pack 15,000 25,000 40,000 70,000 Bullion Pack 20,000 50,000 75,000 99,000 Bullion Metals 25,000 60,000 90,000 1,20,000 BTST/STBT Futures 20,000 35,000 60,000 90,000 Blue Chip 25,000 45,000 85,000 1,50,000 Customised  75,000 1,50,000 2,20,000 3,99,000  From the aforesaid facts, I find that Algo Solution which is proprietorship concern of Shri Piyush Porwal was engaged in giving advice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, through its website http://algosolution.in. I find that these services were being offered by the Noticees in lieu of the consideration which could be paid by the investor concerned in the HDFC Bank Account No. 50200041715722 or Axis Bank Account No. 919020004111460, details of which were provided on the website under Payment Details Section. From the HDFC Bank account statement of Algo Solution, I find that around Rs.9,49,855/- have been credited during the period July 1, 2019 to September 24, 2019, in the said Bank account. Similarly, from the Axis Bank account statement of Algo Solution, I find that around Rs.6,09,775/- have been credited during the period January 14, 2019 to September 24, 2019. In view of this, I find that Noticees were providing the investment advice, in lieu of consideration. In terms of Regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations, 2013 such an advice is \\\\\\\\u201cinvestment advice\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Investmart and its proprietor Shri Anshuman Bhise were engaged in the business of providing investment advice to public, for consideration and were thus, acting as an investment adviser, as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations, 2013.   7. Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 provides as under: Final Order in the matter of ALGO Solution (Proprietor: Shri Piyush Porwal)  Page 8 of 12  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  8. In order to protect the interest of investors and to maintain integrity of the securities market, IA Regulations, 2013 provides safeguards to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected. One such safeguard is that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to obtain registration from SEBI as required under Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013. Regulation 3(1) provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of IA Regulations. Further, safeguards provided under IA Regulations, 2013 includes continued minimum professional qualification and net-worth requirement for investment adviser, disclosure of all conflict of interest, prohibition on entering into transactions which are contrary to advice given for 15 days, risk profiling of investors, maintaining documented process for selecting investment for client based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s objective and risk profile, understanding the nature and risks of products or assets selected for clients, etc.   9. The activities of the Noticees, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that the Noticees were holding themselves out and acting as an investment adviser. However, it is noted that the Noticees is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of Investment Advisor. Hence, I find that these activities/ representations as being made by the Noticees without holding the certificate of registration as investment adviser are in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013. Final Order in the matter of ALGO Solution (Proprietor: Shri Piyush Porwal)  Page 9 of 12  10. In my view, unregistered investment advisors like the Noticees in the present case can put investors at great risk by misleading them. In the present case, Noticees on their website, inter alia, mentioned that Algo Solution provide trade alerts via sms every day and live tips and Algo Solution also offers recommendations in Cash, Futures, Index, Bullions, Metals and Energy. Noticees on their website further represented that Algo Solution, is a trusted name in the financial services group which provides investors with the entire gamut of financial services under one ceiling, Algo Solution is one of the few organizations which provide research and information on Indian capital markets mainly based on Technical Analysis and enjoys a strong reputation among investors, brokers and researchers, Algo Solution is highly skilled with experienced analysis, their efforts are to provide investors more & more profit in every trade, Algo Solution is providing help to investors to grow in their financial position by Short-Term investing or Trading in Indian Stock Market. As stated above, SEBI Act, 1992 and IA Regulations, 2013 requires any investment advisor to hold a certificate of registration to act as such. I find that Noticees were not holding any certificate of registration from SEBI to act as investment advisor. Thus, the claims/representations made by the Noticees on their website were misleading and were made to allure investors to avail investment advisory services being offered by the Noticees. The Noticees have knowingly misrepresented on the websites floated by them that they are experts in stock market analysis and are experienced in investment advisory. Without holding any registered Investment Advisor certificate, the Noticees offered investment advisory services through their website, to investors, with the objective of raising money through subscriptions to their various plans. The above discussed misleading representations are deceptive activities of the Noticee and therefore, fraudulent and are covered within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d defined under Regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. It is noted that fraudulent activities/ conduct/ act/ practice of the Noticees, as discussed above, are also in violation of provisions of Section 12A (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations 3(d) and Regulations 4(1) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. Regulation 4(2)(k) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003, provides that  dealing  in securities  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  manipulative, fraudulent  or  an  unfair  trade practice  if  it  involves  disseminating  information  or  advice  through  any  media, whether physical or digital, which the disseminator knows to be false or misleading and  which  is  designed  or  likely  to  influence  the  decision  of  investors  dealing  in Final Order in the matter of ALGO Solution (Proprietor: Shri Piyush Porwal)  Page 10 of 12  securities.  In the present case, Noticees without holding certificate of registration as investment adviser, knowingly hold themselves as investment adviser on their website. Thus, I find that Noticees have also violated Regulations 4(2)(k) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  11. I note that the material available on record does not indicate the exact amount of fees collected by  the  Noticees,  as  a  result  of  providing  investment  advice  to investors,  in  violation  of  the  provisions  of  the  IA  Regulations, 2013.  However, interim order records  that one complaint was received against the Noticees wherein the complainant had claimed that he had paid an amount of Rs. 53,000/- to the Noticees, for availing investment advisory services from them.   12. In  view  of  the  foregoing,  I,  in  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  upon  me  in terms Sections 11, 11(4),11B(1) and 11D,read with of Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 11 of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003, and in supersession of the directions in the interim order, hereby direct that:  (i) The Noticees shall within a period of three months from the date of this order, refund the money received from the clients/investors/complainant, as fees or consideration or  in  any  other  form,  in  respect  of  their  unregistered  investment  advisory activities;  (ii) The Noticees shall issue public notice in all editions of two National Dailies (one  English  and  one  Hindi)  and  in  one  local  daily  with  wide  circulation, detailing the modalities for refund, including the details of contact person such as names, addresses and contact details, within 15 days of coming into force of this Order;  (iii) The repayments to the clients/investors shall be effected only through Bank Demand Draft or Pay Order or electronic fund transfer or through any other appropriate  banking  channels,  which  ensures  audit  trails  to  identify  the beneficiaries of repayments;  (iv) The Noticees are prevented from selling their assets, properties and holding of  mutual funds/shares/securities held  by them in  demat  and Final Order in the matter of ALGO Solution (Proprietor: Shri Piyush Porwal)  Page 11 of 12  physical  form except for the sole purpose of making the refunds as directed above. Further, the banks are directed to allow debit only for the purpose of making refunds to  the clients/investors who  were  availing  the  investment  advisory  services from  the  Noticees,  as  directed  in  this  order,  from  the  bank  account of  the Noticees,  wherein  debit has  been  frozen  by  virtue  of  interim  order  dated July 24, 2020;  (v) After completing the aforesaid repayments, the Noticees shall file a report of such completion with SEBI addressed to the Division Chief, CIS Division, Investment Management Department, SEBI Bhavan, Plot No. C4 A, G Block, Bandra Kurla Complaex, Bandra (East) Mumbai \\\\\\\\u2013 400051, within a period of 15 days, after completion of three months from the coming into force of this order, duly certified by an independent Chartered Accountant.

The direction for refund, as given in paragraph 12(i) above, does not preclude the clients/investors to pursue the other legal remedies available to them under any other law, against the Noticees for refund of money or deficiency in service before any appropriate forum of competent jurisdiction.  14.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) received a complaint vide email dated August 25, 2013, wherein it was alleged, inter-alia, that a few companies in Tamil Nadu are collecting monies from public through various schemes and Wisdom Agro Tech India Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cWISDOM/ Company\\\\\\\\u201d) was one of the companies mentioned in the said complaint. In order to conduct preliminary inquiry into whether or not WISDOM was carrying on activities of Collective Investment Scheme (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cCIS\\\\\\\\u201d) in terms of Section 11 AA of the SEBI Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI sought certain/ additional information about the schemes operated by the WISDOM. In the course of preliminary inquiry, SEBI also obtained information available with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), Chennai from MCA- 21 portal. Upon preliminary examination of the matter on the basis of the material available on record including information received from the WISDOM, SEBI vide its interim Order dated December 10, 2014 under Sections 11(1), 11B and 11(4) of the SEBI Act  read with Regulation 65 of the SEBI (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cCIS Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), issued Adjudication Order in the matter of Wisdom Agro Tech India Ltd.,  Page 2 of 10       directions, inter-alia, restraining the Company and its Directors namely Mr. Anantharaman Nallaperumal, Govinda Pilai Reghukumaran, Gilbert James Dhason, Kumaresan Vasantha kumari, Jeyashoba Thankappan Rajam and Prabhu Kannan, from collecting any fresh money from investors under its existing schemes.  2.

It is observed that the company had admittedly mobilized \\\\\\\\u20b984.10 lakh from April 2013-till January 16, 2015 (i.e., after the date of passing of the interim order dated December 10, 2014), from its existing customers, despite being restrained from mobilizing money from its existing customers.   3. Subsequent to the investigation carried out by SEBI into the business activity of WISDOM for the period 2010-11 to 2015-16, SEBI vide its finalorder dated August 14, 2019, inter-alia, restrained WISDOM and its aforesaid directors except Mr. Anantharaman Nallaperumal (since Mr. Anantharaman Nallaperumal had passed away on January 28, 2019) from launching any new collective investment schemes without seeking registration from SEBI in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Act and CIS Regulations and restrained them from accessing the securities market and also prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities, directly or indirectly, or being associated with the securities market in any manner, whatsoever, for a  period of four years or till the completion of proceedings under TNPID Act, whichever is later.

Based on the findings of investigation, that the WISDOM has mobilized funds from the public despite being restrained from collecting any fresh money from investors Adjudication Order in the matter of Wisdom Agro Tech India Ltd.,  Page 3 of 10       under its existing schemes, Adjudication Proceedings were initiated against the Directors of WISDOM namely Mr. Anantharaman Nallaperumal, Mr. Govinda Pilai Reghukumaran (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee 1\\\\\\\\u201d), Mr. Gilbert James Dhason (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee 2\\\\\\\\u201d), Ms. Kumaresan Vasanthakumari (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee 3\\\\\\\\u201d) and Ms. Jeyashoba Thankappan Rajam (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee 4\\\\\\\\u201d) (hereinafter aforesaid four Noticees collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d) and the undersigned was appointed as Adjudicating Officer (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAO\\\\\\\\u201d) vide order dated September 04, 2017 to inquire into and adjudge under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act for the alleged violations by the Noticees, of Section 12(1B) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3 of CIS Regulations for not complying with SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s directions issued vide SEBI interim order dated December 10, 2014. The appointment of the AO was communicated vide communique dated July18, 2018.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  5. A Common Show Cause Notice(hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) having reference Nos. SEBI/EAD-6/PM/RR/19405/1/2019 dated July 31, 2019;SEBI/EAD-6/PM/RR/19406/1/2019 dated July 31, 2019; SEBI/EAD-6/PM/RR/19407/1/2019 dated July 31, 2019; SEBI/EAD-6/PM/RR/19408/1/2019 dated July 31, 2019 and SEBI/EAD-6/PM/RR/19410/1/2019 dated July 31, 2019 was issued to Anantharaman Nallaperumal and the Noticees 1 to 4 respectively, in terms of Rule 4 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995#(hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAdjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) read with Section 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992. [# With effect from March 8, 2019, SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 was amended to SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995]  6. It is noted from the records that the SCN in respect Anantharaman Nallaperumal and Noticees 1 to 4 were sent by SPAD and were duly served on the Noticees2 and 4. The SCN sent to Noticees 1 and 3 returned undelivered. It is noted that the no Adjudication Order in the matter of Wisdom Agro Tech India Ltd.,  Page 4 of 10       replies were received from the Noticees 2 & 4, despite receipt of SCN by them. In the meantime, it came to notice that Anantharaman Nallaperumal had passed away on January 28, 2019and in view of the same, Abatement Order dated November 06, 2020, was passed in respect of Anantharam Nallaperumal disposing off the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against him.   7. Further, in compliance with the principles of natural justice, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to Noticees 1& 2 vide emails dated 05 January, 2021 (based on the availability of their respective email-ids), on January 25, 2021. In view of the prevailing circumstances owing to Covid-19, the hearing was scheduled through Video Conference on the platform of Webex. It was also noted that SCN dated July 31, 2019 along with its Annexures was also sent to the said Noticees along with the Hearing Notices. However, I note that the emails sent to Noticee 1 & 2 were bounced. Further, in respect of the Noticees 2 & 4, an opportunity of hearing was provided on January 25, 2021, which was communicated vide Notice dated January 05, 2021, thereby sending a copy of SCN once again. I further note that the said Hearing Notices to Noticee 2 & 4 were delivered. Since, the SCN and the notice of hearing in respect of Noticees 1 & 3 could not be served by way of Speed Post, Email, in terms of the provisions of Rule 7(d) of Adjudication Rules, a notice was published in the newspapers of Times of India and Dinakaranin its Madurai edition on February 23, 2021 and January 5, 2021 respectively. Vide the aforementioned newspaper publication, the Noticees were provided with one more opportunity to furnish their reply within 14 days from the date of publication of the notice, besides providing them with an opportunity of hearing on March 12, 2021& January 22, 2021 respectively. I note that the Noticees have neither filed their replies nor have appeared for hearing.   8. In this context, I would like to rely upon the observations of The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in the matter of Classic Credit Ltd., vs. SEBI (Appeal 68 of 2003 decided on December 08, 2006) wherein the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, inter alia, observed that - \"............ the appellants did not file any reply to the second show- Adjudication Order in the matter of Wisdom Agro Tech India Ltd.,  Page 5 of 10       cause notice. This being so, it has to be presumed that the charges alleged against them in the show-cause notice were admitted by them\\\\\\\\u201d.  9. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT has again in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Others vs SEBI (Appeal  68 of 2013 decided on February 11, 2014), interalia, observed that \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026As rightly contended by Mr. Rustomjee, learned senior counsel for respondents, appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted charges levelled against them in the show cause notices\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d.  10. In view of the above observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT and considering that no request has been received from any of the Noticees seeking more time for filing written reply or for personal hearing, I find no useful purpose would be achieved by granting any more opportunity of personal hearing to the Noticees, hence, I proceed to deal with matter ex-parte, based on materials available on record.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS  11. I have perused the SCN dated July31, 2019 and the material available on record. I note that the SCN had charged the Noticees of having violated the provisions of Section 12(1B) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3 of CIS Regulations. It is a matter of record that the Noticees were in fact violated the aforesaid provisions, which has been appropriately dealt in the Interim Order dated December 10, 2014 and accordingly directions were issued to the Noticees. I note that vide the aforesaid Order, the Company and the Noticees were restrained from collecting any fresh money from investors under its existing schemes. The instant Adjudication proceedings were initiated against the Noticees since the Noticees mobilized money from investors under its existing schemes despite being restrained vide Order dated December 10, 2014. In view of the fact that the current proceedings are limited to the alleged violation of non-compliance of the directions issued by SEBI vide interim Order dated December 10, 2014, I am confining myself to find out Adjudication Order in the matter of Wisdom Agro Tech India Ltd.,  Page 6 of 10       whether the Noticees have raised money despite being restrained by the aforesaid Order and accordingly, I have the following issues for consideration.  Issue \\\\\\\\u2013 I: Whether the Noticees have complied with the directions issued vide Interim Order dated December 10, 2014?  Issue \\\\\\\\u2013 II: If violations are established then whether the failure, on the part of the Noticees would attract monetary penalty under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992?  Issue \\\\\\\\u2013 III: If yes, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticees taking into consideration the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992?  ISSUE 1- Whether the Noticees have complied with the directions issued vide Interim Order dated December 10, 2014?  12. I note that SEBI, vide an ex-parte interim Order dated December 10, 2014  observed that Wisdom Agro Tech India Limited was engaged in fund mobilizing activities from the public, which was in the nature of a Collective Investment Scheme  in terms of Section 11AA of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992  without obtaining a certificate of registration from SEBI as required under Section 12(1B) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 3 of the SEBI (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 1999. The interim order was issued in order to protect the interest of investors, to ensure that the Company and its Directors do not collect further funds under its schemes/ plans and to safeguard the assets/ acquired by Wisdom and its directors from the funds of the investing public. This Order directed Wisdom and its Directors, namely, Mr. Anantharaman Nallaperumal, Mr. Govinda Pillai Reghukumaran, Mr. Gilbert James Dhason, Ms. Kumaresan Vasanthakumari, Ms. Jeyashoba Thankappan Rajam and Mr. Prabhu Kannan: Adjudication Order in the matter of Wisdom Agro Tech India Ltd.,  Page 7 of 10       \"(i). not to collect any fresh money from investors including under its existing schemes;  (ii). not to launch any new schemes or plans or float any new companies to raise fresh moneys;  (iii). to immediately submit the latest inventory of the assets including land obtained through money raised by Wisdom  (iv). not to dispose of or alienate any of the properties/ assets obtained directly or indirectly through money raised by Wisdom.  (v). not to divert any funds raised from public at large which are kept in bank account(s) and/or in the custody of the company.    13. I note that the interim order has discussed the factors by which the fund mobilization activity of the Company satisfies the four conditions as specified in Section 11AA(2) of the SEBI Act. I further note from records that subsequent to issue of the aforesaid directions, WISDOM had submitted its reply vide its letter dated January 16, 2015 and May 30, 2015. As per the submissions made, WISDOM had collected \\\\\\\\u20b93.88 crore from its customers as under:  i. \\\\\\\\u20b92.55 crore from 5,365 investors under its \\\\\\\\u2018instalment payment plan\\\\\\\\u2019 during September 2010 to March 2013 ii. \\\\\\\\u20b91.33 crore from 485 investors under its \\\\\\\\u2018cash down payment plan\\\\\\\\u2019 during September 2010 to March 2013 iii. \\\\\\\\u20b984.10 lakhs (from existing customers) from April 2013 till January 16, 2015.  14. It can be seen from the replies submitted by the Company, that the Company had admittedly mobilized \\\\\\\\u20b984.10 lakh from April 2013 - till January 16, 2015 (i.e., after the date of passing of the interim order dated December 10, 2014), from its existing customers. In this regard, it is noted that the interim order had restrained the Company and its Directors from collecting funds from the investors. The conduct of the Company in mobilizing public funds under its schemes post passing of the interim order is therefore a breach of the interim order. I note that the Noticees were Adjudication Order in the matter of Wisdom Agro Tech India Ltd.,  Page 8 of 10       Directors of WISDOM and were responsible for the conduct of the business of WISDOM during the period of mobilization of funds from the public during the period, when the Noticees were restrained from mobilizing funds. I note that, in case any person raises fund through unregistered CIS, SEBI normally directs such entity not to access the securities market and not to deal in securities in any manner, for a particular period. In the instant matter, despite being restrained from mobilizing money from public under its existing schemes, I note that the Noticees have mobilized money from the public and thus acted against the regulatory directions. Therefore, I find that the Noticees by mobilizing money from the public under its existing schemes, which are found to be collective investment schemes in nature, despite being restrained, had not complied with the Directions issued by SEBI vide Order dated December 10, 2014.   ISSUE II: If violations are established then whether the failure, on the part of the Noticees would attract monetary penalty under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992?  15. It is clearly established from the above findings that Noticees 1 to 4 by way of their acts have not complied with the directions issued by SEBI vide Interim Order dated December 10, 2014.Therefore, as the alleged violations against the Noticee 1 to 4 stand established, the Noticees are liable for monetary penalty under Section 15HB of SEBI Act, the provisions of which are reproduced hereunder:  Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided.  Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees.  16. In this connection, I deem it appropriate to refer to the observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Deepak kumar Shantilal Jain Vs SEBI (Appeal No. 490 of 2018), wherein the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT vide Order dated September 24, 2019 observed Adjudication Order in the matter of Wisdom Agro Tech India Ltd.,  Page 9 of 10       that \\\\\\\\u201cAdmittedly, there has been a failure on the part of the appellant in not complying with the order of WTM as well as failure on the part of the appellant in not complying with the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India.  Thus, no relief can be granted to the appellant\\\\\\\\u201d.  17. In view of the foregoing, I find that the act of the Noticees in not complying the directions issued under Section 11B of SEBI Act, is a serious violation, which cannot be viewed leniently.   ISSUE III: If yes, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticees taking into consideration the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act?  18. While determining the quantum of monetary penalty under Section 15HB of SEBI Act, I have considered the factors stipulated in Section 15J of SEBI Act, which read as under:  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer  15J. While adjudging quantum of penalty under Section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:- a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  ORDER  19. Therefore, in view of the findings mentioned in the preceding paragraphs and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15 \\\\\\\\u2013I of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 5 of Adjudication Rules, 1995, I hereby impose a penalty of  \\\\\\\\u20b95 lakh (Rupees Five lakhs only) each on the Noticees1 to 4. Adjudication Order in the matter of Wisdom Agro Tech India Ltd.,  Page 10 of 10       20. The said penalty imposed on the Noticees, as mentioned above, is commensurate with the violation committed and acts as a deterrent factor for the Noticees and others in protecting the interest of investors.    21. The Noticees shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR through online payment facility available on the SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in on the following path, by clicking on the payment link: ENFORCEMENT\\\\\\\\uf0e0Orders\\\\\\\\uf0e0Orders of AO\\\\\\\\uf0e0PAY NOW  22. The Noticee shall forward the said Demand Draft or the details / confirmation of penalty so paid to the Enforcement Department \\\\\\\\u2013 1, Division of Regulatory Action-3, of SEBI. The Noticees shall provide the following details while forwarding DD/ payment information:  Case Name   Name of Payee  Date of payment  Amount Paid  Transaction No  Bank Details in which payment is made  Payment is made for  Penalty  23. In terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995, a copy of this order is being sent to Noticees and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Mumbai.

In respect of:  Noticee No.  Name of the entity PAN No. 1. Investmart (Proprietor: Mr. Anshuman Bhise) DYFPB1666H   1. The present proceedings have emanated from an ex-parte ad-interim order cum show cause notice dated February 7, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe interim order\\\\\\\\u201d) passed by Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d)  inter alia against Investmart and its sole proprietor Shri Anshuman Bhise, (hereinafter collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticees\\\\\\\\u201d), as the unregistered investment advisory activities of the Noticees were found to be in violation of the provisions of Section 12(1) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) and Regulation 3(1) of SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations, 2013\\\\\\\\u201d). Further, in the interim order, the activities of the Noticees were prima facie found to be fraudulent and manipulative and in violation of provisions of Section 12A (a), (b) & (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations 3 (b), (c) & (d) and Regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations, 2003). By the interim order, following directions were issued against the Noticees:Final Order with respect to Investmart (Proprietor: Anshuman Bhise) Page 2 of 12  i The Noticees shall cease and desist from acting as an investment advisor including the activity of acting and representing through any media (physical or digital) as an investment advisor, directly or indirectly, and cease to solicit or undertake such activity or any other activities in the securities market, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, until further orders.    ii The Noticees shall not access the securities market and buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, until further orders.      iii The Noticees shall not divert any funds raised from investors, kept in bank account(s) and/or in their custody until further orders.    iv The Noticees  shall not  dispose of or alienate any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge on any of assets held in their name, including money lying in bank accounts except with the prior permission of SEBI.     v The Noticees shall immediately withdraw and remove all advertisements, representations, literatures, brochures, materials, publications, documents, websites, communications etc., in relation to their investment advisory activity or any other unregistered activity in the securities market until further orders.    vi The Noticees shall provide a full inventory of all assets held in the name of the proprietorship or the proprietor and firm or the partner, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge on any of such assets, including details of all bank accounts, demat accounts and mutual fund investments, immediately but not later than 5 working days from the date of receipt of this order.    vii Any person while working under the above mentioned Noticees as employee or otherwise, shall cease and desist from undertaking the activity of investment advisory services, including the activity of acting and representing through any media (physical or digital) as an investment advisor, directly or indirectly, till further orders.    viii The Banks are directed not to allow any debits/ withdrawals from or credits to the accounts of the Noticees, held jointly or severally, without the permission of SEBI. The Banks are directed to ensure that all the above directions are strictly enforced.    ix The Depositories are directed to ensure that till further directions no debits are made in the demat accounts of the Noticees held jointly or severally.    x The Registrar and Transfer Agents are also directed to ensure that till further directions the securities, including Mutual Fund units, held in the name of the Noticees, jointly or severally, are not transferred or redeemed.   2. The interim order was also in the nature of a show cause notice wherein the NoticeesFinal Order with respect to Investmart (Proprietor: Anshuman Bhise) Page 3 of 12  were provided with the opportunity to file their objections/reply, if any, within 21 days from the date of the interim order and were also provided with an opportunity of personal hearing before SEBI, on a date and time to be fixed on a specific request to be made by the Noticees, in that regard. In this regard, it is noted that the Noticees have neither filed any reply/objections to the interim order nor sought any personal hearing. Hence, I shall now proceed to determine the matter ex-parte and on the basis of material available on record.   3. I find that the interim order passed in the matter contained following observations with respect to the Noticees:  (i) SEBI received a letter dated May 6, 2019 from Ms. Anju Sharma (\\\\\\\\u2018Complainant\\\\\\\\u2019), inter  alia, alleging  that  she  paid  Rs.76,000/- to  Investmart  for Demat account opening. While opening the Demat account, Investmart, inter alia, informed the complainant that:  a. They will charge for handling Demat account and will take 20% of the profit. b. Every month the details regarding transactions in Demat account will be sent on E-mail. c. They will never trade without prior permission from the complainant.  (ii)  Complainant further stated in her complaint that after the payment, Investmart showed that the complainant has incurred losses and closed her Demat account.  (iii) Along with the aforesaid letter, Complainant also attached the copy of print-out of website details of Investmart, documentation details sent via messages, screenshots of trade details carried out in her Demat account and bank account details of Investmart.  (iv) It  was  observed  that  the  Complainant  had  made  payment  to  Axis  bank account of Investmart. Accordingly, necessary information were sought from Axis bank. Vide  email  dated  July  4,  2019, Axis  Bank, inter  alia,  forwarded  theFinal Order with respect to Investmart (Proprietor: Anshuman Bhise) Page 4 of 12  KYC, AOF  and  account  statement  for  Investmart.  From information submitted  by  Axis Bank, the following observations are made:  (a) Anshuman Bhise is the proprietor / owner of the Investmart. He has furnished a copy of Aadhar Card, PAN Card and Business License to the Bank. (b) In  the  account  opening  form  of  the  Investmart,  the  type  of  account  has  been mentioned as \\\\\\\\u2018Current\\\\\\\\u2019 and the Nature of Business as \\\\\\\\u2018Service Provider\\\\\\\\u2019. (c) From the address proof submitted to the bank, it appears that Anshuman Bhise\\\\\\\\u2019s address is 124/3, Nanda Nagar, Indore, Madhya Pradesh - 452011.  (v) From  the  Axis  Bank  account  of  Investmart,  it  is  observed  that  around Rs.4,136,734/- have been credited during the period October 23, 2018 to July 3, 2019 in the said account. It is observed that numerous credits have been received with the narration of Investment and Trading.  (vi) A  search on  the  internet  made  in  the name  of \\\\\\\\u2018Investmart\\\\\\\\u2019  showed  its website as - https://www.investmart.info. It is seen from the website that Investmart advertises itself as an investment advisory company, providing recommendations in Stock Cash, F&O, Commodities including bullions, metals & agro-commodities, and assures more than 90% accuracy in its recommendations.  (vii) The  website  pages mention  services  in Equity,  Commodity,  Derivative, Forex  and  Customized  Services  as  well  as  various  other  categories  of  services with different price ranges.  4. From the details of transactions processed through payment gateways, account statements of the relevant bank accounts, KYC records of bank accounts/ payment gateways, material available on the websites of the Noticees and the material submitted by the Complainant along with her complaint, interim order made the  following prima facie observations:   a. Noticees are not registered as investment advisors with SEBI. b. The Noticees have floated their website viz: www.investmart.info.   c. The activity of Noticees, through their website, of holding themselves out toFinal Order with respect to Investmart (Proprietor: Anshuman Bhise) Page 5 of 12  be giving advice  / recommendation  in  relation  to  securities  being  traded  in  the  securities market  and  /  or  also  in  relation  to  commodities  and  forex    to  the  investors  and general public, and payment receipts of the complainants indicating the payment was  made  for  receiving  investment  advice,  the  bank  statement prima  facie, showing  the  credit inter  alia for  payment  of  fees,  indicates  that  there  is  a preponderance of probability that Noticees, apart from holding themselves out as investment advisor(s), have acted as an investment advisor for consideration. d. The website of the Noticees was live and running, as on the date of the interim order, and also reflect the bank account details/payment gateway through which the investors desirous of availing their services can make direct payment.  e. Payment gateways such as PayUmoney, Paytm, etc. and direct transfers to bank accounts reflected on the  website were  used  for  receiving  payments inter  alia towards subscription fee/product purchase from investors.  f. Continuous  credits  have  been  received  in  the  accounts  of  these  unregistered Noticees.  5. I note that the definition of investment adviser, as given in Regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, 2013, provides that investment adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations defines investment advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d   6. I note that Noticees on their website i.e. https://www.investmart.info advertised Investmart as an investment advisory company, providing recommendations in Stock Cash, F&O, Commodities including bullions, metals & agro-commodities, and assures more than 90% accuracy in its recommendations. The website pages mentioned that Noticees offer services  in Equity,  Commodity,  Derivative, ForexFinal Order with respect to Investmart (Proprietor: Anshuman Bhise) Page 6 of 12  and  Customized  Services  as  well  as  various  other  categories  of  services with different price ranges. I note that following pricing details for availing various services were mentioned on the website of the Noticees:   Monthly Quarterly Half Yearly Yearly Basic Stock Cash 8,500 28,000 28,000 46,000 Basic Stock Future 8,500 28,000 28,000 46,000 Basic Stock Options 8,500 28,000 28,000 46,000 HNI Stock Cash 8,500 28,000 28,000 46,000 HNI Stock Future 8,500 28,000 28,000 46,000 HNI Stock Option 8,500 28,000 28,000 46,000 Index Option 8,500 28,000 28,000 46,000 Index Future 8,500 28,000 28,000 46,000 BTST 8,500 28,000 28,000 46,000 Premium Stock Cash 8,500 28,000 28,000 46,000 Premium Stock Future 8,500 28,000 28,000 46,000 Premium Stock Option 8,500 28,000 28,000 46,000  From the aforesaid facts, I find that Investmart which is proprietorship concern of Shri Anshuman Bhise was engaged in giving advice relating to investing in,Final Order with respect to Investmart (Proprietor: Anshuman Bhise) Page 7 of 12  purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, through its website www.investmart.info. I find that these services were being offered by the Noticees in lieu of the consideration which could be paid by the investor concerned in the Axis Bank Current Account No. 918020097535427 of Investmart maintained with Vijaynagar Branch, Indore, details of which were provided on the website. From the detail of the said bank account, I note that total of Rs. 4,136,734/- have been credited during the period October 23, 2018 to July 3, 2019 in the said account. I note that numerous credits in the said bank account were received with the narration \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment and Trading\\\\\\\\u201d. In view of this, I find that Noticees were providing the investment advice, in lieu of consideration. In terms of Regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations, 2013 such an advice is \\\\\\\\u201cinvestment advice\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Investmart and its proprietor Shri Anshuman Bhise were engaged in the business of providing investment advice to public, for consideration and were thus, acting as an investment adviser, as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations, 2013.   7. Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 provides as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  8. In order to protect the interest of investors and to maintain integrity of the securities market, IA Regulations, 2013 provides safeguards to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected. One such safeguard is that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to obtain registration from SEBI as required under Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013. Regulation 3(1) provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of IA Regulations. Further,Final Order with respect to Investmart (Proprietor: Anshuman Bhise) Page 8 of 12  safeguards provided under IA Regulations, 2013 includes continued minimum professional qualification and net-worth requirement for investment adviser, disclosure of all conflict of interest, prohibition on entering into transactions which are contrary to advice given for 15 days, risk profiling of investors, maintaining documented process for selecting investment for client based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s objective and risk profile, understanding the nature and risks of products or assets selected for clients, etc.   9. The activities of the Noticees, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that the Noticees were holding themselves out and acting as an investment adviser. However, it is noted that the Noticees is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of Investment Advisor. Hence, I find that these activities/ representations as being made by the Noticees without holding the certificate of registration as investment adviser are in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013.  10. In my view, unregistered investment advisors like the Noticees in the present case can put investors at great risk by misleading them. In the present case, Noticees on their website mentioned that Investmart is an investment advisory company, providing recommendations in Stock Cash, F&O, Commodities including bullions, metals & agro-commodities. Noticees further mentioned on their website that they assure more than 90% accuracy in their recommendations. The website pages mentioned that Noticees offer services  in Equity,  Commodity,  Derivative, Forex  and  Customized  Services  as  well  as  various  other  categories  of  services with different price ranges. As stated above, SEBI Act, 1992 and IA Regulations, 2013 requires any investment advisor to hold a certificate of registration to act as such. I find that Noticees were not holding any certificate of registration from SEBI to act as investment adviser. Thus, the claims/representations made by the Noticees on their website were misleading and were made to allure investors to avail investment advisory services being offered by the Noticees. The Noticees have knowingly misrepresented on the websites floated by them that they are experts in stock market analysis and are experienced in investment advisory. Without holding any registered Investment Advisor certificate, the Noticees have held themselves out asFinal Order with respect to Investmart (Proprietor: Anshuman Bhise) Page 9 of 12  investment  advisors  and offered  services through their website to investors with the objective of raising money through subscriptions to their various plans. The above discussed misleading representations are deceptive activities of the Noticee and therefore, fraudulent and are covered within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d defined under Regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. It is noted that fraudulent activities/ conduct/ act/ practice of the Noticees, as discussed above, are also in violation of provisions of Section 12A (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations 3(d) and Regulations 4(1) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. Regulation 4(2)(k) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003, provides that  dealing  in securities  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  manipulative, fraudulent  or  an  unfair  trade practice  if  it  involves  disseminating  information  or  advice  through  any  media, whether physical or digital, which the disseminator knows to be false or misleading and  which  is  designed  or  likely  to  influence  the  decision  of  investors  dealing  in securities.  In the present case, Noticees without holding certificate of registration as investment adviser, knowingly hold themselves as investment adviser on their website. Thus, I find that Noticees have also violated Regulations 4(2)(k) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  11. I note that the material available on record does not indicate the exact amount of fees collected by  the  Noticees,  as  a  result  of  providing  investment  advice  to investors,  in  violation  of  the  provisions  of  the  IA  Regulations, 2013.  However, interim order records  that one complaint was received against the Noticees wherein the complainant had claimed that she had paid an amount of Rs. 76,000/- to the Noticees, for availing investment advisory services from them.   12. In  view  of  the  foregoing,  I,  in  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  upon  me  in terms Sections 11, 11(4),11B(1) and 11D,read with of Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 11 of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003, and in supersession of the directions in the interim order, hereby direct that:  (i) The Noticees shall within a period of three months from the date of this order, refund the money received from the clients/investors/ complainants, as fees or consideration or in any other form, in respect of their unregistered investment advisory activities;Final Order with respect to Investmart (Proprietor: Anshuman Bhise) Page 10 of 12  (ii) The Noticees shall issue public notice in all editions of two National Dailies (one  English  and  one  Hindi)  and  in  one  local  daily  with  wide  circulation, detailing the modalities for refund, including the details of contact person such as names, addresses and contact details, within 15 days of coming into force of this Order;  (iii) The repayments to the clients/investors shall be effected only through Bank Demand Draft or Pay Order or electronic fund transfer or through any other appropriate  banking  channels,  which  ensures  audit  trails  to  identify  the beneficiaries of repayments;  (iv) The Noticees are prevented from selling their assets, properties and holding of mutual funds/shares/securities held by them in demit and  physical  form except for the sole purpose of making the refunds as directed above.

If yes, whether the Noticees are liable for penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992? c. If yes, what should be the quantum of penalty that should be imposed on the Noticee(s)? 7.

From above table, it was alleged that suspected group entities had contributed to net positive LTP of Rs. 612.89 during patch 1 of IP. Their total contribution was 33.75% of market positive LTP contribution as a buyer during patch 1, through 9152 trades. 13. On further, analysis of the above buy trades of the suspected group contributing to positive LTP, it was observed that in respect of 983 trades, the buy client (suspected group entity) had placed an order for 1 or 2 shares although a Sell order was existing for a larger quantity. Such trades had contributed to Rs. 298.52 towards positive LTP, i.e. (5.23% of the net market positive LTP).

AMVPG6042M SAURABH KUMAR RASIKLAL GANDHI* 15. It was alleged from the trading pattern of the above group (13 entities) as mentioned in para 13, that they were not acting as genuine buyers and had no bona fide intention to buy because in-spite of sufficient sell orders with abundant quantity being available in the market, they placed buy orders for only 1 or 2 shares repeatedly in each transaction, in 983 instances, which were above the last traded price. Further, in 49 instances the counterparties were also found to be connected. It was observed that by such repeated trades, the entities, as a group, were instrumental in establishing a price higher than the last traded price and thus contributed to increase in scrip price with each of their trades. Hence, it was alleged    Page 12 of 14  that the Noticees, who were a part of the above mentioned group of entities, manipulated the scrip price and created a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip of AVIL by such trades in violation of Regulations 3(a)(b)(c)(d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) and 4(2)(e) of PFUTP Regulations. Incidentally, I note that proceedings under Section 11, 11(4) and 11B(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 were also initiated in the matter. 16. In the meanwhile, I note from the website of Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) that the status of the Noticees is being shown as \\\\\\\\u201cStrike Off\\\\\\\\u201d. Copies of the Company Master data of the Noticees from the MCA website are placed in the file. Since the status of the Noticees is showing as \\\\\\\\u201cStrike Off\\\\\\\\u201d, it is imperative to see whether the Noticees are existing or not.  17. On perusal of the various \\\\\\\\u2018Form No. STK-7, Notice of Striking Off and Dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019, as available on the MCA website, I note that Registrar of Companies, Maharashtra and Registrar of Companies, West Bengal, have declared pursuant to Section 248(5) of the Companies Act, 2013, that the Noticee companies have been struck off the Register of Companies, through various notices. The details in this regard are as follows:  Name of the Noticee Date of the \\\\\\\\u2018Form No. STK-7, Notice of Striking Off and Dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 Reference No of relevant \\\\\\\\u2018Form No STK-7\\\\\\\\u2019  Date of dissolution as per the Notice As declared by Registrar of Companies, Maharashtra Moss Traders Pvt Ltd July 19, 2017 ROC-MUM/Section 248/2017/STK-7/4 July 07, 2017 Ailish Traders Pvt Ltd July 10, 2017 ROC-MUM/Section 248/2017/STK-7/1 June 16, 2017 Jeshna Multitrade Pvt Ltd September 12, 2018 ROC-MUM/Section 248/2nd Drive/STK-7/7254 September 11, 2018    Page 13 of 14  Addo Constructions Pvt Ltd September 12, 2018 ROC-MUM/Section 248/2nd Drive/STK-7/7254 September 11, 2018 As declared by Registrar of Companies, West Bengal Sunlight Commotrade Pvt ltd June 30, 2017 ROC/WB/STK/2017/2 June 09, 2017  18. It is noted from the records that the undersigned was appointed as AO in the matter on October 05, 2017, and subsequently, in December 15, 2017, the relevant file in the matter was forwarded to the undersigned. I note that the Noticees viz.

Since the Noticees have been \\\\\\\\u201cdissolved\\\\\\\\u201d, in the facts and circumstances of the instant case, I conclude that the adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticees vide SCN dated February 08, 2018 cannot be proceeded with.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) conducted an investigation into the dealings in the scrip of Gromo Trade & Consultancy Limited (Earlier known as Kamalakshi Finance Corporation Ltd) (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cGTCL/Gromo/company\\\\\\\\u201d) on BSE Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cBSE\\\\\\\\u201d) on witnessing a massive rise in the price of the scrip. 2. GTCL was incorporated on January 15, 1973 in the name of \\\\\\\\u2018Kamalakshi Finance Corporation Private Limited\\\\\\\\u2019. Subsequently, the company converted into public limited company as \\\\\\\\u2018Kamalakshi Finance Corporation Limited\\\\\\\\u2019 with the objects of finance, investment and share tradingon December 11, 1973. The name of the company has been changed to present name, i.e. \\\\\\\\u2018M/s Gromo Trade &Consultancy Limited\\\\\\\\u2019 on March 26, 2015with the object of consultancy and advisory services in the field of management, IT, technical, industrial, personnel and labour, legal and taxation, financial, commercial and investment, capital markets, etc. The registered office of the company is situated at \\\\\\\\u201813/411, Crystal Plaza, New Link Road, opp. to Infinity Mall, Andheri (West), Mumbai- 400053\\\\\\\\u2019 3. As on September 30, 2013, KFCL had a share capital of Rs. 5,00,000 comprising 50,000 equity shares of Rs. 10 each. It was observed that KFCL made 3 preferential allotments, i.e., 82,90,000 equity shares to 42 entities at the price of Rs. 12 per share in November 09, 2013; 1,48,50,000 equity shares to 49 entities at the price of Rs. 13 per share on February 17, 2014 and; 52,00,000 equity shares to 46 entities at the price of Rs. 25 per share on June 24, 2014, thereby allotting 2,83,40, 000 equity shares in total to 137 persons/entities. 4. It was observed that during the period from January 15, 2014 to December 26, 2014, the price of the scrip of GTCL rose from Rs.10.20 to Rs.489.00, i.e. an increase by approximately 48 times in 150 trading days. The sharp rise in the price of the scrip of GTCL during the said period was not supported by fundamentals of GTCL and its financials or any other factor. Investigations were carried out by SEBI in the scrip of KFCL for the period January 15, 2014 to February 20, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Investigation Period/ IP\\\\\\\\u2019) to ascertain the violations, if any of the provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 and SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to SecuritiesPage 3 of 149  Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) and provisions of the Listing Agreement read with Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCRA\\\\\\\\u2019).  5.

In view of this, I find that Noticees were providing theFinal Order against Max Capital (Proprietor: Mahesh Tillore) Page 9 of 13  investment advice, in lieu of consideration. In terms of Regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations, 2013 such an advice is \\\\\\\\u201cinvestment advice\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Max Capital and its proprietor Shri Mahesh Tillore were engaged in the business of providing investment advice to public, for consideration and were thus, acting as an investment adviser, as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations, 2013.   6. Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 provides as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  7. In order to protect the interest of investors and to maintain integrity of the securities market, IA Regulations, 2013 provides safeguards to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected. One such safeguard is that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to obtain registration from SEBI as required under Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013. Regulation 3(1) provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of IA Regulations. Further, safeguards provided under IA Regulations, 2013 includes continued minimum professional qualification and net-worth requirement for investment adviser, disclosure of all conflict of interest, prohibition on entering into transactions which are contrary to advice given for 15 days, risk profiling of investors, maintaining documented process for selecting investment for client based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s objective and risk profile, understanding the nature and risks of products or assets selected for clients, etc.Final Order against Max Capital (Proprietor: Mahesh Tillore) Page 10 of 13  8. The activities of the Noticees, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that the Noticees were holding themselves out and acting as an investment adviser. However, it is noted that the Noticees is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of Investment Advisor. Hence, I find that these activities/ representations as being made by the Noticees without holding the certificate of registration as investment adviser are in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, 2013.  9. In my view, unregistered investment advisors like the Noticees in the present case can put investors at great risk by misleading them. In the present case, Noticees on their website mentioned that stronghold of Max Capital is in providing the most accurate tips. While representing on their website that Noticees provide accurate tips on the securities market, they have also stated that Max Capital is a registered firm. These misleading representations gives investors an impression Max Capital is registered with SEBI, for offering investment advisory services. The Noticees have knowingly misrepresented on the websites floated by them that they are experts in stock market analysis and are experienced in investment advisory. Without holding any registered Investment Advisor certificate, the Noticees have held themselves out as investment  advisors  and offered  services through their website to investors with the objective of raising money through subscriptions to their various plans as mentioned in paras 3 (i) to (iii) above. The above discussed misleading representations are deceptive activities of the Noticee and therefore, fraudulent and are covered within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d defined under Regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003. It is noted that fraudulent activities/ conduct/ act/ practice of the Noticees, as discussed above, are also in violation of provisions of Section 12A (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations 3(d) and Regulations 4(1) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. Regulation 4(2)(k) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003, provides that  dealing  in securities  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  manipulative, fraudulent  or  an  unfair  trade practice  if  it  involves  disseminating  information  or  advice  through  any  media, whether physical or digital, which the disseminator knows to be false or misleading and  which  is  designed  or  likely  to  influence  the  decision  of  investors  dealing  in securities.  In the present case, Noticees without holding certificate ofFinal Order against Max Capital (Proprietor: Mahesh Tillore) Page 11 of 13  registration as investment adviser, knowingly held themselves as investment adviser on their website. Thus, I find that Noticees have also violated Regulations 4(2)(k) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  10. I note that the material available on record does not indicate the exact amount of fees collected by  the  Noticees,  as  a  result  of  providing  investment  advice  to investors,  in  violation  of  the  provisions  of  the  IA  Regulations, 2013. However, interim order  records  that the bank accounts of the Noticees with HDFC Bank and Andhra Bank, linked to the website of the Noticees, show that as on April 15, 2020, a total amount of Rs. 1,55,65,716.85 was received by the Noticees through various payment gateways/IMPS or NEFT. Further, one complaint was received against the Noticees wherein the complainant had claimed that he had paid an amount of Rs. 1,08,200/- to the Noticees, for availing investment advisory services from them.   11. In view of  the  foregoing,  I,  in  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  upon  me  in terms Sections 11, 11(4),11B(1) and 11D,read with of Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 11 of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003, and in supersession of the directions in the interim order, hereby direct that:  (i) The Noticees shall within a period of three months from the date of this order, refund the money received from the clients/investors, as fees or consideration or  in  any  other  form,  in  respect  of  their  unregistered  investment  advisory activities;  (ii) The Noticees shall issue public notice in all editions of two National Dailies (one  English  and  one  Hindi)  and  in  one  local  daily  with  wide  circulation, detailing the modalities for refund, including the details of contact person such as names, addresses and contact details, within 15 days of coming into force of this Order;  (iii) The repayments to the clients/investors shall be effected only through Bank Demand Draft or Pay Order or electronic fund transfer or through any other appropriate  banking  channels,  which  ensures  audit  trails  to  identify  theFinal Order against Max Capital (Proprietor: Mahesh Tillore) Page 12 of 13  beneficiaries of repayments;  (iv) The Noticees are prevented from selling their assets, properties and holding of  mutual funds/shares/securities held  by them in  demat  and  physical  form except for the sole purpose of making the refunds as directed above.

Further, the Noticees heavily traded in the scrip and created volume at higher prices during last half an hour on June 29, 2017 to get a better future settlement price.  l) It is alleged that the aforesaid scheme of \\\\\\\\u201cmarking the close\\\\\\\\u201d devised by the six Noticees enabled four of them who had taken long positions in the Biocon Ltd. futures during 15:00:00 hrs to 15:30:00 hrs on June 29, 2017 to increase their profit arising out of their long positions.  m)  It is alleged that all the 6 Noticees viz.

The various submissions made by the Noticees vide their aforesaid replies, written submissions and those made during the course of the hearing, are summarised as hereunder: a) Noticee no. 1 (Gangwal Sunil Kumar) vide letters dated December 30, 2020, inter alia submitted that: (i) On perusal of the Notice, I understand that the same is issued to me since I had carried out transactions in Biocon Shares on June 29, 2017 during last half an hour (15:00 to 15:30). In this regard, at the outset, I reiterate that in the Notice, analysis of transactions is not done in rightful manner and SEBI has ignored material and vital fact that I had placed limit orders on sale side with stop loss order on buy side. Besides I had carried out intraday trading. Pertinently, the volume of trading from limit orders was 4 lakh shares and intraday trading was 32,300 shares. Importantly, the orders were placed through 3 stock brokers viz. R K Global Shares and Securities Ltd., Vardhamanglobal Sharecom Pvt. Ltd and JM Financial Services Ltd. In fact no bifurcation of the type, pattern and nature of my trading is elaborated in the Notice. Besides it is pertinent to mention that the alleged self-trades of 1 lakh shares were not carried out through JM Financial. I further state that the findings that I had placed sell orders at a price less than the buy order price is also incorrect. Hence, the findings in the Notice are faulty, factually incorrect and thereupon charges are levelled against me merely on assumption, presumption, surmises and conjecture. Hence, initially I would like to make my submissions on such erroneous findings to bring clarity on such adverse conclusions drawn against me. (ii) It is alleged that I have entered into reversal trades with other co-noticees during in the cash market in script of Biocon on 29.06.2017 during 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm to create artificial/fictitious volume in the market and also false and misleading appearance of trading in Biocon. The alleged reversal trade happened when my stop loss order got triggered. Pertinently stop loss order was placed at around 14:40 pm, and trade got executed at around 15:22 pm i.e. after around 40 minutes. Importantly stop loss order got automatically executed on the computerised trading system of NSE (NEAT) where matching of order is auto driven process. Besides at the relevant time i.e. at around 15:22 pm, large volume of trading had taken place in Biocon shares. Hence matching of order Final Order in the matter of Biocon Limited   Page 11 of 86  with the same person is purely co-incidence. In reality I had no role, involvement or participation on matching of trade with same person. Incidentally on alleged reversal trade, there is no allegation if any price movement. Thus market equilibrium was not disturbed. Hence no adverse inferences be drawn for such innocuous execution of reversal trades. (iii) It is alleged that I have entered into self-trades which created artificial/ficticious volume in the market and also false and misleading appearance of trading in Biocon. In this regard, I state that I had placed stop loss order with price limit with two brokers viz. RK Global and Vardhamanglobal. Incidentally, first stop loss order was to trigger on execution of sale order price of Rs. 334.05 with stop loss price of Rs. 334/- and second stop loss order was to trigger on execution of sale order at a price of Rs. 334.10 with stop loss price of Rs. 334.05. However, both the orders got triggered at the identical time. Hence a stop loss sale order of Rs. 334.05 placed with one broker got matched with a buy limit order placed at a price of Rs. 334.05 with another broker. Importantly, two separate orders were placed at around 14.40 pm which got matched at around 15.22 by the auto drawn system of the Stock exchange. The execution of said self-trades were unintentional. It is further pertinent to mention that matching of self-trades had happened at the then prevailing market price. Hence, no adverse inferences had drawn against us in this regard. (iv) Normally I do not place any large trade without a fixed stop loss as happened on June 29, 2017 when I placed the order with a fix take profit as presumably volatility is high in stock markets. This is a routine feature in my trading. At the relevant time, I had thought in my mind that if price crosses that range, I have immediately stop loss it. Incidentally I placed the stop buy orders simultaneously with self trades. Nothing other than this was my motive. To the best of recollection of my memory, I state that on that day I was facing the connectivity problem on internet, due to which prices were not updating properly. Hence there was a lot of confusion as to exact price movement in Biocon shares due to the poor internet connection. (v) In response to para (a), at the outset I state that in the part two (orders placed between 3 and 3:30 pm), first the buy orders were placed and correspondingly the sell orders were placed. Pertinently it is alleged that I have placed buy order price at Rs. 332.40 to 332.45 when LTP was Rs. 331.40 to 332.12 and trades on top 6 instances are given in Table 12 of pg 9 of the SCN. It is pertinent to mention that the orders were placed in order to get the preference in the buy Final Order in the matter of Biocon Limited   Page 12 of 86  positions and that too at a very nominal price difference from LTP. For instance, in Table no. 6, Sr. no. 6, Bid price is Rs. 332.45 and LTP was 332.15. It can be clearly seen that there is a negligible price difference of Rs. 0.30 in order to get the preference of buy orders. It is humbly stated that due to technical error and not being able to view the LTP I instructed the dealer of the Broker to put the sell order at a price available in the market. Pertinently, my intention was to earn nominal profits but due to technical error I suffered a loss. Importantly the broker through whom the orders were placed between 2:30 and 3:00 were RK Global and Vardhmanglobal and orders placed in between 3:20 and 3:22 were through JM Financial. b) Noticee no. 2 (Vihit Investment) vide letters dated December 03, 2020, inter alia submitted that: (i) With regard to our personal relationship/connection with Mr. Sunil, we state that on and around 18.05.2018 in a function held at Avadh Uptopia Club, Surat on the occasion of opening ceremony of the club our partner viz. Mr. Mohit Mehta was introduced to Mr. Sunil by Mr. Ankur Babaria as a person who is also regularly carrying out share trading activity which appeared to us as similar to our nature of share trading activity. However, even at that point in time we are not aware of the fact about execution of trading in Biocon on 29.06.2017 by him. It is only on receipt of the SCN, we came to know about his role and investment in Biocon. (ii) With regard to the financial (Banking transaction) with Gangwal, we state that due to urgent fund requirement on 22.07.2019, we approached Mr. Ankur Babaria for own short term requirement who has an account with HDFC Bank. Since he had no funds available he got funds arranged from Mr. Sunit. It is pertinent to mention that we received Rs. 1,40,00,000/- from Mr. Sunil on 22.07.2019 and the amount was repaid to him on 24.07.2019 to the extent of Rs. 70,00,000/- and the remaining account of Rs. 70,00,000/- was repaid on 26.07.2019. Further, an interest of Rs. 9781/- was paid on this said amount borrowed. We further state that Mr. Ankur Babaria had approached us w.r.t. a loan required by Mr. Sunil. In view thereof we provided Mr. Sunil with a loan of Rs. 94,00,000/- on 09.10.2019 and the amount was returned by him to the extent of Rs. 50,00,000/- on 11.10.2019 and the remaining amount of Rs. 44,00,000 was returned back to us on 15.10.2019. Pertinently Interest income of Rs, 8,447/- was booked for the same and a TDS of Rs. 847/- was deducted on the same. Final Order in the matter of Biocon Limited   Page 13 of 86  (iii) With respect to our dealing in Biocon on June 29, 2017, we submit that since high volatility and movement was expected in market we had put our buy/sell order at around 02.24 pm with a nominal spread. We believed that if large number of participants dealt in said scrip we could earn small profit on differential of buy/sell quote. Further, if price of scrip rose to that level, our buy/sell would be executed during the day without us having to give/take delivery. The price of Biocon scrip in F/O segment at around 3:15 pm appeared to be lower than corresponding price in cash segment. Considering open interest position prevailing at relevant time, we preferred to take a calculated risk by putting buy order in F/O segment. (iv) Further, it has been alleged against us that we have made wrongful gains from our long position in the F&O segment. It is pertinent to mention that the price of Biocon in the F&O at around 03:15 pm on 29.06.2017 appeared to be lower than corresponding price in cash segment. Further, considering open interest position prevailing at relevant time, we preferred to take a calculated risk by putting buy order in F&O Segment. On perusal of the price volume chart of F&O segment at NSE, no adverse inferences to be drawn against us on consideration of volume and market rates prevalent on that day i.e. 29.06.2017. We further state that if we had any knowledge about the alleged scheme, if any devised as alleged in the SCN or otherwise our trading pattern would have been different.  (v) In response to para (b) of para 8, we submit that on perusal of the daily price movement of Biocon even during the month of June 2017, the difference in high and low price of shares traded is more than Rs. 7/- and at times it is furthermore depending on the market conditions according to our observation. Besides we submit that buy order rate of Rs. 334.05/- and the sell order of 334.10/ cannot be alleged to be punched at a faraway price as stipulated under NSE Circular dated 22.02.2005.  (vi) In response to para (d) we respectfully submit that we believed that there would be high liquidity in the script of Biocon during 29.06.2017. Pertinently we thought that we can safely make profits while trading in Biocon by availing benefits of marginal spread between available buy and sell quotes. It is pertinent to mention that our sole intention was intra-day trading to earn profits. Hence, we humbly state that in case we would have placed that buy price between 327.80 and 334.05 there would have been a high probability for the buy order to get executed and the sale order not to get executed since the sale order was placed Final Order in the matter of Biocon Limited   Page 14 of 86  at 334.10 and there would have been a major variation in the buy and sale order price which would inter alia led to delivery of shares which was not the purpose for which the transaction was executed.  (vii) In response to para (e), we humbly state that we have no idea that the buy order of 1,00,000 shares were matched with Mr. Sunil. Further, pertinently the 1,00,000 buy order of shares were to correspondingly cover the shares sold earlier on the same day. We further reiterate that as on 29.06.2017 i.e. day of the impugned transactions we were in no way related to Mr. Sunil. Pertinently, on perusal of the order log file, it can be stated that out to the total buy quantity on 2,00,000 that includes 33 trades only 99,800 shares have matched with Mr. Sunil that includes only 10 trades.  (viii) In response to para (f) w.r.t. taking long position in futures in the scrip of Biocon, it is clarified that the price in F&O segment in script of at around 03:15 pm appeared to be lower than the corresponding price in cash segment and considering the open interest rate prevalent at the time we put in buy order in F&O segment.   c) Noticee no. 3 (Mohd Faisal) vide letters dated July 21, 2020, inter alia submitted that: (i) It is pertinent to note that the orders in cash segment were entered much before I had created any position in the derivative segment. As per the SCN, at para 9 (VII) \\\\\\\\u2013 I had placed the orders to sell Biocon at Rs. 334 14:51 PM and with an anticipation that if the price reaches that level I would sell the shares and not below that. However, I am an intraday trader and therefore also placed a stop loss order to buy these shares at 334.10 at 14.42 hrs. Stop loss order would have ensured that my loss from the trade can be only 10 paisa per share and not more but if the price would have fallen after my orders at 334, I would have made some money. It is therefore evident beyond doubt that my strategy was never carried out with an intention of getting a better price for my F&O position by marking the close as alleged as it was much before 3 pm. (ii) It could have been possible that the trade would have taken place before 3 pm and in such case there would have been no impact because of such trade. If I intended to execute such trade to mark up the closing price as alleged, I would have preferred to place the order at 3:00 pm or thereafter and not before. The SCN records in clause 8.C.iii.c records that it was normal for me to place sell order at Rs. 334 but finds fault with my buy order placed at 334.10 when the Final Order in the matter of Biocon Limited   Page 15 of 86  LTP was Rs. 327.5. The SCN has completely failed to appreciate that a stop loss order is always placed at a price which will be executed after the original order is executed. In the current case the buy order was a stop loss order and therefore would have only executed if my sell order executed. Else it would have automatically been left out without trading. The SCN does not find issues with the price difference of Rs. 6.25 for sell orders but fails to appreciate that the price difference between by sell and buy order which was merely 10 paise, which means I wanted to exit the position if my loss would be 10 paise. These buy orders were placed to square off the position if the bet goes against me and not to take fresh buy position as envisaged by SEBI.

It was observed that the synchronized trades executed by the Noticees were repetitive and significant in volume which created artificial volumes in the scrip and were allegedly fraudulent. It was also observed that except for Prashant Patel (Noticee no. 3) and Moneybee Realty P. Ltd. (Noticee no. 7), Finquest Securities P. Ltd. was the common broker for all the remaining Noticees mentioned in the above table. Hardik B Patel and Minal B Patel (Noticee no. 1) are directors of Finquest Securities P. Ltd.  2.14. In view of the above, it is alleged that the Noticees No. 1 to 7 by repetitively executing synchronized trades within the group created misleading appearance of trading in the scrip without any intention of change in ownership of the securities and thereby violated Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d), 4 (1), 4 (2) (a) and (g) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003  3.

Thereafter, SCN was served on Noticee nos. 3 and 5 through publication in newspaper i.e. Times of India on February 15, 2020 and in Maharashtra Times  on February 15, 2020.       Final Order in the matter of Transpek Industry Ltd.                                               Page 6 of 18     5. Vide a letter dated December 18, 2019,  Noticee no. 7 filed his reply and submitted as under:  i) The funds received from  Noticee no. 4 were unsecured loans. ii) It had bought 24,930 shares of Transpek on January 27, 2014 which it sold on February 04 and 05, 2014 in order to make short terms gains. It had not indulged in synchronized trades and its trading volume was also negligible.  6. Letters dated March 17, 2020 were received from Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 4 seeking more time to file reply. Thereafter, the matter was placed before me on May 29, 2020 for grant of a hearing date and a hearing date was fixed on August 24, 2020. None of the Noticees appeared for the hearing fixed for the said date. Letters dated August 10, 2020 were received from Noticee nos. 1 and 2 seeking more time to file reply in the matter and stating that if more clarification is required after filing of their replies, they would attend the hearing and till then the hearing be kept in abeyance. Vide a letter dated September 18, 2020, Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 4 filed their replies to the SCN and sought a copy of the Investigation Report and any other document relied upon while issuing the SCN. These Noticees were informed, vide email dated September 29, 2020, that all documents relied upon in the SCN has already been provided as Annexures to the SCN. Replies dated October 09, 2020 were received from Noticee nos. 5 and 6 wherein these Noticees also sought a copy of the Investigation Report and any other document relied upon while issuing the SCN. These Noticees were informed vide letter dated November 09, 2020 that all documents relied upon in the SCN has already been provided as Annexures to the SCN.   7. Vide reply dated September 18, 2020 Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 4 have submitted as follows:  7.1. There has been inordinate delay in issuance of SCN even though the details were furnished by SEBI but it is humanly impossible for any investor to       Final Order in the matter of Transpek Industry Ltd.                                               Page 7 of 18    remember and recollect and explain rationale or reasons now in 2020 as to how and why such trades of 2011-12, 201213, 2013-14 & 2014-15 were executed. It is also submitted that the reasons for such could be liquidity requirements, booking of profit or loss, tax planning, availability of better alternative investment or business opportunities. It is also relevant to note that in view of large volume in market and limited human memory it is not possible to exactly give rationale for transactions. 7.2. The investigation has not disclosed any reasons for splitting investigation period into various patches and for attributing purported wrongdoing by linking everyday movement and fluctuation in prices of shares. In fact, the investigation has failed to recognize that fluctuations in prices of shares were caused by innumerable factors.  7.3. In fact, the investigation has failed or ignored to recognise the principle that price is a result of demand and supply of scrips. It is further stated that reasons for doing transactions could be many things including some news about the company, about industry in which a company operates, specific Government steps which may affect sector or market in short or longer run, price parity of other scripts such as some other scripts have fallen or risen sharply. Further, a particular price parity favours switch in scripts, liquidity requirement, good profit as intended.  7.4. It is submitted that the dealing, if any, with alleged connected entities is in the regular course of business and cannot be attributed any specific reason that may be in the mind of the author of the SCN. It is also stated that volume does not mean or indicate any breach and/or violation of any Rules and Regulations of securities market or would mean any wrongdoing.  7.5. Noticee no. 2 (Ruchit B. Patel) is the son of Noticee no. 1 and Noticee no 4 (Pat Financial Consultants Pvt. Ltd.) is a Company and Noticee no. 2 is a Director thereof. They are financially independent. They have their own investment portfolio built over more than 12 years and are independently large taxpayer. There is not bar to \"connected\" parties trading. In fact, even negotiated trades between connected parties are not prohibited and are very common.       Final Order in the matter of Transpek Industry Ltd.                                               Page 8 of 18    7.6. It is denied that we have repetitively executed synchronized trades within group and the allegation is contrary to facts and as mentioned in SCN. On the one hand, it is alleged that these Noticees have executed trades repetitively and on other hand, the SCN itself confirms that they have traded ONLY for 22 days during 1385 days of investigation period i.e. December 15, 2011 to September 30, 2015.  7.7. It is also denied that the said trades had created misleading appearance of trading in the scrip without any intention of change in ownership of the security. The allegation is devoid of logic, truth and evidence These Noticees have executed trades only for 22 days in BSE out of investigation period of 1385 days and all transactions are resulted into delivery and transferred from/or to Demat Statement and become registered holder and owner of the shares and transaction were done on platform of Stock Exchange and for consideration in normal course of purchase/ sale of stock and effect of transaction is reflected in audited accounts in respective years. 7.8. It is wrong to allege and assume that the transaction is done without any intention to change ownership while our Demat statements clearly show delivery of the same. The allegation that it created misleading appearance is without any evidence and is misleading. In fact, transaction has been displayed on Bulk deal of Stock Exchange window when the quantity traded exceeds 0.5 %  of share capital of the Company. 7.9. It is also stated that there is no prohibition on synchronized trading in securities, so long as the transactions are effected in accordance with the Stock Exchange Mechanism, securities delivered, and that the transaction has not been effected with manipulative intent to artificially move the price of the stock. It is nowhere stated in SCN that alleged synchronized trades have manipulated prices of shares. The SCN does not even alleged that any loss has been caused to any investors in the market. Also SCN does not even allege that there was any malafide objective, purpose or motive to execute the trades. It is also not even alleged that the Noticees were in any manner connected to or acting at behest of the promoter or director of the Company whose shares are being traded. It is stated that the Noticee and       Final Order in the matter of Transpek Industry Ltd.                                               Page 9 of 18    family are still holding more than One Lakh equity shares of the company. Therefore, no ulterior motive could be attributed to the transactions. 7.10. Having regard to what is stated above and, in all fairness, and reasonableness and interest of security market, you are requested to withdraw the SCN under reference.  8. Vide their reply dated October 09, 2020, Noticee nos. 5 and 6 submitted as under:  8.1. Noticee no. 6 is not part of any group or Bharat group as alleged. It is erroneous to conclude that they were part of any group or Bharat Patel group, as there was movement of fund with Director of Noticee no.6, Vanraj Vinodchandra Shah. Their transaction is done in ordinary course of business and are in compliance various rules and regulations of securities market. 8.2. Noticee no. 5 has stated that just because one of its directors was a director of a company wherein son and wife of Bharat J. Patel was a director does not make it part of any group as alleged. 8.3. As per information submitted, it states that Noticee no.6 has executed synchronized trades for 13 Days in BSE out of investigation period of 1385 days. The above details itself proves that alleged synchronized transactions were not done repetitively as alleged. The trade was done on the floor of the exchange and as per the rules and regulations of the exchange. 8.4. As per information submitted, it states that Noticee no.5 has executed synchronized trades for 2 Days in BSE out of investigation period of 1385 days. The above details itself proves that alleged synchronized transactions were not done repetitively as alleged. The trade was done on the floor of the exchange and as per the rules and regulations of the exchange. 8.5. It is matter of records that the ownership of the shares has changed which can be verified from demat statements. The transaction has resulted into delivery and for consideration and effect of this transaction was reflected in audited account of respective years. The allegation that transaction was       Final Order in the matter of Transpek Industry Ltd.                                               Page 10 of 18    done without any intention of change in the ownership is devoid of truth and bald statement. 8.6. There is no prohibition on synchronized trading in securities, so long as the transactions are effected in accordance with the Stock Exchange Mechanism, securities are delivered, and that the same has not been effected with manipulative intent. It is also noted that there is no allegation that these trades were done with the intention to manipulate. It is nowhere stated in SCN that alleged synchronized trades has manipulated prices of shares. 8.7. Delay has caused prejudice to the parties and therefore the proceedings initiated by SEBI is to be quashed and set aside.  9. Thereafter, another date of hearing was granted to the Noticees on December 02, 2020. Authorized Representative of Noticee no. 7 appeared and made submissions on the said date through video conferencing. Since, this was the second opportunity of hearing and none of the other Noticees appeared, the hearing was concluded qua all Noticees.  During the hearing, the Authorized Representative of the Noticee no. 7 reiterated the submissions made in its reply dated December 18, 2019.   CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS AND FINDINGS  10. I have considered the SCN, replies received and submissions made by the Noticees during the personal hearing granted to them. Before proceedings further, it would be appropriate to refer to the provisions of law which are alleged to have been violated by the Noticees and the relevant extracts of the same are reproduced below:  Relevant extract of the provisions of PFUTP Regulations:   3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under;       Final Order in the matter of Transpek Industry Ltd.

The Noticees have raised a preliminary issue pertaining to the proceedings suffering from delay. I note that the initiation of the investigation in the present proceedings emanated from a joint examination report of NSE and BSE, regarding the trading activities of Bharat Patel Group in certain scrips, on the basis of alerts generated by surveillance system of stack exchanges and reference made by SEBI, alleging circular trading in the scrip of Ponni Sugars (Erode) Limited by the said Group. The said examination report was forwarded to SEBI on February 24, 2014. It was observed in the examination report that Bharat Patel Group entered into bulk deals amongst themselves and reversed the said deals within a short period of time at either of the exchanges. 17 scrips wherein Bharat Patel Group executed major bulk deals were identified including the scrip of Transpek by NSE and BSE. In this regard, I note that investigation was initiated in respect of the matter by SEBI, which was completed in February 2019, due to the large number of scrips being investigated. Thereafter, the SCN was issued on November 18, 2019. A letter dated December 24, 2019 was received from Noticee no. 6 and letters dated December 26, 2019 were received from Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 4, all seeking more time to file replies to the SCN. Similar letter was also received from Noticee no. 3 on February 03, 2020.       Final Order in the matter of Transpek Industry Ltd.                                               Page 12 of 18    Thereafter, letters dated March 17, 2020 was received from Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 4 seeking further time to file reply. Thereafter, the matter was placed before me on May 29, 2020 for grant of a hearing date and a hearing date was scheduled on August 24, 2020. None of the Noticees appeared for the hearing on the scheduled date. Letters dated August 10, 2020 were received from Noticee nos. 1 and 2 seeking more time to file reply in the matter and stating that if more clarification is required after filing of replies by them, they would attend the hearing and till then the hearing be kept in abeyance. Vide a letter dated September 18, 2020, Noticee nos. 1,2 4 filed their replies to the SCN and sought a copy of the Investigation Report and any other document relied upon while issuing the SCN. These Noticees were informed vide email dated September 29, 2020 that all documents relied upon in the SCN have already been provided as Annexure to the SCN.  Replies dated October 09, 2020 were received from Noticee nos. 5 and 6 wherein these Noticees also sought a copy of the Investigation Report and any other document relied upon while issuing the SCN. These Noticees were also informed vide letter dated November 09, 2020 that all documents relied upon in the SCN have already been provided as Annexure to the SCN. Thereafter, another date of hearing was granted to the Noticees on December 02, 2020. Authorized Representative of Noticee no. 7 appeared and made submissions on the said date through video conferencing. Since, this was the second opportunity of hearing and none of the other Noticees appeared, the hearing was concluded qua all Noticees. In these facts and circumstances of the present matter, I note that the investigation has been conducted and proceedings have been initiated in reasonable time and I find that there is no delay in the present matter and the contention of the Noticees in this regard is untenable.  12. I note that Noticee nos. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 had sought a copy of the Investigation Report and any other document relied upon while issuing the SCN. I note that these Noticees have been informed that all documents relied upon in the SCN have already been provided as Annexure to the SCN. In this regard, reference may be made to the order dated February 12, 2020 passed by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in Appeal (L) No. 28 of 2020 \\\\\\\\u2013 Shruti Vora Vs. SEBI, wherein it was observed as under:       Final Order in the matter of Transpek Industry Ltd.                                               Page 13 of 18    \\\\\\\\u201cIn the light of the aforesaid, we are of the opinion that concept of fairness and principles of natural justice are in-built in Rule 4 of the Rules of 1995 and that the AO is required to supply the documents relied upon while serving the show cause notice. This is essential for the person to file an efficacious reply in his defence.\\\\\\\\u201d  The aforesaid observations made in Shruti Vora\\\\\\\\u2019s case has been reiterated with confirmation by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in its order dated July 17, 2020 passed in Appeal No. Anant R Sathe Vs. SEBI wherein it was observed as under:  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.8. The said principle elucidated in Shruti Vora\\\\\\\\u2019s judgement is squarely applicable in the instant case. The authority is required to supply the documents that they rely upon while serving the show cause notice which in the instant case has been done and which is sufficient for the purpose of filing an efficacious reply in his defence\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  In the present case also, I find that the Noticees have been provided with all the relevant documents relied upon in the SCN which are sufficient for the Noticees to file an efficacious reply in the matter.   13. The SCN alleges that the Noticees were connected to each other and that Noticee nos. 1 to 7 by repetitively executing synchronized trades within the group created misleading appearance of trading in the scrip of Transpek without any intention of change in ownership of the securities.  14. I note that the allegation of connection between the Noticees, has been made on the basis of certain links found amongst the Noticees. The table containing the basis of connections on the basis of the links found, as given in SCN, is reproduced below:       Final Order in the matter of Transpek Industry Ltd.                                               Page 14 of 18       15. I note that the Noticees have denied that they were part of any group. Noticee nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 in their common reply have stated that Noticee no. 2 is the son of Noticee no.1 and Noticee no. 2 is also the director of Noticee no.4.  Noticee no. 5 has stated that one of its directors was a common director of a company wherein the wife and son of Bharat J. Patel was a director. Noticee no. 6 has stated that there were fund transactions between one of its directors and Bharat J. Patel. But Noticee no. 5 and 6 have contended that no adverse inference can be drawn on the same. Noticee no. 7 in its reply has stated that it received funds from Noticee no. 4.  16. I note that in the table provided in the SCN, as reproduced above, the Noticees appear at Sr. nos. 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12 and 15. I also note that the SCN states that Sr. no.PANEntity NameBasis of Connection 1. Director  in Fidelity Multitrade Ltd., Pranav Holdings Pvt. Ltd., Pasha Finance Pvt.

Aakruti Nirmiti Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAakruti\\\\\\\\u201d/ \\\\\\\\u201cCompany\\\\\\\\u201d) was incorporated on May 8, 2006 as Aakruti Nimriti Pvt.

Its registered office is at \\\\\\\\u201c002-CHANAKYA, OPP. T-WARD OFFICE, DEVI DAYAL ROAD, MULUND WEST, MUMBAI - 400080\\\\\\\\u201d.  2. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) conducted an examination into the fund raising activity alleged against Aakruti in respect of public issue of equity shares and undertook an enquiry to ascertain whether Aakruti had made any public issue of equity securities without complying with the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956, Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and the Rules and Regulations framed thereunder including SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cDIP Guidelines\\\\\\\\u201d) read with SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure requirements) Regulations, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cICDR Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d).  Show Cause Notice 3. Consequent to the completion of examination, a common Show Cause Notice (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) dated October 16, 2018 was sent to Noticee Nos. 1 to 18 in the extant matter to show cause as to why suitable actions/directions in terms of Sections 11 (1), 11(4), 11A and 11B of the SEBI Act should not be initiated against them for the alleged violation of the provisions of Sections 56(1), 56(3), 60, 73 read with Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956 and Clauses 2.1.1, 2.1.4, 2.2,  Order in the matter of Aakruti Nirmiti Limited                                                                                  Page 3 of 46 4.11, 4.14, 5.3.1, 5.4.1, 5.6.2, 8.8.1, 5.6A and 6.0 to 6.15 of DIP Guidelines, by all the Noticees  4. The facts and allegations as set out in the SCN are as follows: 4.1. On enquiry by SEBI, it was observed that Aakruti had made a public offer of equity shares, on seven instances during the period April 17, 2007 to December 15, 2007, in the financial year 2007-08 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cOffer of Equity Shares\\\\\\\\u201d) and raised an aggregate amount of Rs. 29,83,68,170/- from 284 allottees. The number of allottees and funds mobilised has been collated from Form 2 (return of allotment) submitted by the company.  4.2. It is observed from the reply dated February 23, 2018 of the company that during the 2007-08, Noticee Nos. 2 to 7 were the Promoter-Directors of the company, Noticee Nos. 8 to 15 were the Promoters of the company and Noticee Nos. 16 to 18 were the Directors of the company.  4.3. In view of the above, it is alleged that, the company made allotment of equity shares to a total of 284 persons on 7 instances from April 17, 2007 to December 15, 2007, hence, there was an obligation to file prospectus in connection with the issue of securities and comply with the relevant provisions of Companies Act, 1956 and DIP Guidelines. 4.4. Noticee Nos. 2 to 18 were the Promoters and Directors of Noticee No. 1, as the case may be during the relevant period, and as such were responsible for the affairs of the Noticee No. 1. It is therefore, alleged that they have also violated the relevant provisions of Companies Act, 1956 and DIP Guidelines along with the company.   5. Based on the above, the Noticees were advised to show cause as to why suitable actions/directions in terms of Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11A and 11B of SEBI Act should not be initiated against them for the alleged violation of the provisions of Companies Act, 1956 and DIP Guidelines.  Reply and Hearing 6. Company, post receipt of the SCN, vide its letter dated November 2, 2018 requested  Order in the matter of Aakruti Nirmiti Limited                                                                                  Page 4 of 46 for additional time to submit a reply to the SCN. Company vide its letter dated December 3, 2018 inter alia submitted as follows on behalf of Noticee No. 1 to 17: 6.1.  The company\\\\\\\\u2019s current authorised capital is Rs. 35,00,00,000 divided into 3,50,00,000 equity shares of Rs. 10 each and the paid-up capital of the company is Rs. 28,37,83,170. 6.2. Noticee Nos. 2 to 7 being Hindu Undivided Family(s) (HUFs) are promoters of the company and not the Directors of the company. However, the Kartas of the said HUFs are the Promoter \\\\\\\\u2013 Directors of the company. Further, Noticee No. 17 was not at all concerned with financial transaction and matters of the company. 6.3. Section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956 puts a restriction on the number of persons to whom the shares shall be allotted under single offer or invitation by providing that no offer or invitation of shares and debentures shall be made which will result whether directly or indirectly in such shares or debentures being made available for purchase or subscription to 50 persons or more at a time. 6.4. There was no public circulation of the application forms / private placement offer letter. 6.5. Private Placement(s) made by the company during the year 2007 shall not be regarded as the public offer by way of deeming fiction under the first proviso to Section 67(3). As there was no invitation / offer by the company to more than 50 persons on any of such occasion(s), Section 67 is not at all attracted. The allotment of equity shares of the company on private placement basis was made to the members of Patel community and all the allottees in the above mentioned allotment were the family members\\\\\\\\u2019 / family friends / friends of existing shareholders and Promoters of the company. 7.

Para 10(a) of SCN may be read as follows: (a) directions against Noticee No. 1 to 18 for refund of all subscription money in terms of Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956. 16. A second common SCN dated December 20, 2019 was issued to Noticee Nos. 19 and 20 in the matter wherein apart from reiterating the facts and allegations as stated in SCN dated October 16, 2018, following was alleged: 16.1. Noticee Nos. 2 to 18 were the Promoters and Directors of Noticee No. 1, Noticee No. 19 was the Chairman & Managing Director and Noticee No. 20 was the Joint Managing Director of Noticee No. 1 during the relevant period and as such were responsible for the affairs of the Noticee No. 1. 17.

In response to the aforesaid Notices, the company vide its letter dated January 13, 2020 again submitted its reply dated June 18, 2019 18. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, another hearing opportunity was granted to the Noticees Nos. 1, 7, 9, 15, 18, 19 and 20 on July 28, 2020. Service of the hearing notice was done through email and newspaper publication. In  Order in the matter of Aakruti Nirmiti Limited                                                                                  Page 9 of 46 response to the same Noticee Nos. 1, 19 and 20 requested to adjourn the hearing due to unavoidable situations. Subsequently, hearing opportunity was granted to Noticees No. 1 to 6, 8, 10 to 14, 16, 17, 19 and 20, on August 25, 2020. Service of the hearing notice was done through email, courier and newspaper publication. The hearing scheduled on August 25, 2020 could not be conducted on health grounds of Noticees No. 19 and 20. Consequently, Noticees were granted hearing opportunity on September 17, 2020 which also was not availed by the Noticees as the AR of the Noticees was unavailable for personal reasons. A final opportunity of hearing was granted to the Noticees on December 2, 2020.  19. On the day of scheduled hearing, ARs appeared for and on behalf of all the Noticees while Noticees No. 19 and 20 also appeared in person. The ARs submitted as follows: 19.1. That the company issued equity shares in the year 2007-2008 in 7 tranches. 19.2. The Promoters of the company belong to the Kutchi Patel community and they had approached some individuals belonging to their community to raise funds. The offer to subscribe to shares of the company was made only to 41 persons. Those 41 persons expressed interest to invest in the company on behalf of their family members. The offer letter that was sent to these 41 individuals specified that the issuance was on a private placement basis. 19.3. There was no public notice, advertisements or any other form of marketing for any of the issuances. No fees/brokerage were paid to any party for procuring any allotment. 19.4. That the number of allottees stated in the SCN is incorrect. The allotment at the relevant time was made to 278 allottees and not to 284 allottees. There were six individuals who had transferred their shares whose details have been included in the number of 284 allottees. 19.5. That the company invested its funds of Rs. 30.83 crores (including the Rs. 28 crores from the issuances) in two real-estate projects in Bangalore.  Order in the matter of Aakruti Nirmiti Limited                                                                                  Page 10 of 46 19.6. That during this pandemic, liquidating the assets for the purpose of refund if any will be difficult as the entire real-estate industry is looming under the negative impact of the lock-down. Such direction at this stage will put further financial strain on the cash flow of the company leading it to its insolvency and will prejudice the interests of shareholders.  19.7. The Noticees viz., Shri Vishwadeep Patel, Ms.  Neeta Shantilal Patel, Ms. Rekha Mahesh Patel, Ms. Madhu Manilal Patel, Ms. Ramila Vinesh Patel, Ms. Rachana Vithal Patel and Ms. Dharmistha Patel are family members and relatives of the Promoters and have no role to play in the issuance. None of these Noticees have attended any Board Meeting or participated in any manner in the issuances. Further, Noticee Nos. 16, 17 and 18 viz., Shri Shailendra Jhallawar, Shri Sunil Naik and Ms. Anita Pirgal are Professional Directors who have no role to play in the overall working of the company and were bona fide third parties with no interest other than professional fees. 19.8. The Noticees were granted time upto December 17, 2020 to file written submissions. 20.  The company on behalf of all the Noticees and in response to all the SCNs including supplementary SCN, vide its letter dated December 17, 2020 submitted as follows: 20.1. The SCN alleges that because allotment was made to 284 parties, there were obligations in relation to public issue required to be complied with by the company and its Promoters / Directors. However, it is apparent from Section 67 (3) of Companies Act, 1956 that the relevant aspect is the manner in which invitation / offer is made and the number of people to whom the invitation / offer is made.  20.2. It is submitted that the number of allottees stated in the SCNs is incorrect. The allotment at the relevant time was made to 278 allottees and not to 284 allottees. There were six individuals who had transferred their shares whose details have been included in the number of 284 allottees. The number of allottees is therefore 278 and not 284.  Order in the matter of Aakruti Nirmiti Limited                                                                                  Page 11 of 46 20.3. Out of the 278 individuals to whom shares were allotted, 64 individuals were related to the Promoters/Directors of company. There was no specific offer made to these individuals and they have, on account of their relations with the Director/Promoters have invested in the shares of the company.   20.4. The offer to subscribe to shares of company was made to 41 specific individuals. It was these 41 individuals that subscribed to the shares of company in their own names and in the names of their family members or close associates. 20.5. The company confirms that apart from 41 specific individuals, no invitation or offer was made to another party.  20.6. It was only at the unilateral instance of these 41 individuals that shares were issued to their family members and associates. The investment discussions were generally undertaken by one of the family members although the investment were made by family members individually depending on the availability of funds, tax and other fiscal considerations.  20.7. The company did not consider the family members and associates of these 41 individuals to be outsiders or public as they were closely associated with the 41 individuals to whom the offer was made. 20.8. The facts of the present case are distinct from those in Sahara\\\\\\\\u2019s Case where the offer was made to 3 crore people and was subscribed to by 66 lakh individuals. The present case does not warrant the same approach.   20.9. The focal point of Section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956 is on \\\\\\\\u201coffer and invitation made\\\\\\\\u201d and not on \\\\\\\\u201csubscription\\\\\\\\u201d. Considering, the offer was made only to a selected group of 41 persons mentioned above, the question of any violation as alleged does not arise. 20.10. Further while computing the total number of offer made, there are certain class of person who come within the criteria of exempted persons and therefore an offer made to such person cannot be included in the total offers  Order in the matter of Aakruti Nirmiti Limited                                                                                  Page 12 of 46 made. The exempted categories include offer made to promoters, directors, existing members and their respective relatives. 20.11. Without prejudice to other submissions, it is submitted that the shareholding of various public investors in the company has reduced from 278 to 196 presently. The Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014 allow issuance of shares upto 200 persons in a financial year. The number of such allottees being less than the present number allowed by law, a reasonable view may be taken and no direction or adverse order may be issued against ANL and the other Noticees. 20.12. Out of total paid up capital of Rs. 28.43 crores as on March 31, 2008, the Promoters and Promoters\\\\\\\\u2019 family members\\\\\\\\u2019 contribution was more than 38% (Rs. 11 crore). This means that the management and promoters of the company are themselves invested in the working and enhancement of the financial position of the company. The Promoters have themselves, between 2007 and 2015, purchased about 10% shareholding of approximately 10% (2.9 lakh shares), in their personal capacity where the shareholders wanted an exit. 20.13. It is submitted therefore that the funds invested by the shareholders are presently backed by assets showing in the books of the company. It is submitted therefore that when the interest of the shareholders is protected, there is no reason for any direction to refund any monies to them. 20.14. In addition to the investment made in the ongoing projects, an outstanding debt to the tune of Rs. 39 crore extended by ANL to M/s Innovative Film City Private Limited, is not readily available as Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process have been activated against the debtor. 20.15. Any direction of refund to these 196 shareholders would be no less than writing the saga of dissolution of the company and the company will need to liquidate its assets to repay the amount (despite there being no demand from the shareholders). Such a direction will mean that the assets will need to be sold as distress not fetching their correct value. The company may then not  Order in the matter of Aakruti Nirmiti Limited                                                                                  Page 13 of 46 even be in a position to repay the entire amounts. 20.16. On account of the sluggish real estate market and the damage due to the ongoing pandemic, it will not be possible for companies such as Aakruti to be able to raise liquidity in the immediate future. Therefore, to saddle the company with the obligation to repay the shareholders at this juncture will necessarily mean that the company, which otherwise has prospects and has been sustaining growth will be seriously prejudiced. 20.17. Noticee Nos. 9 to 15 are family members and relatives of the Promoters and have no role to play in the issuance. None of these Noticees have attended any Board Meeting or participated in any manner in the issuances. 20.18. Noticee Nos. 16, 17 and 18 are Professional Directors who have no role to play in the overall working of the company and were bona fide third parties with no interest other than professional fees. It is submitted that there is no reason for any direction against these parties. Consideration of Issues and Findings 21. I have considered the SCNs, replies, oral submissions and other materials available on record. On perusal of the same, the following issues arise for consideration. Each issue is dealt with separately under different headings. 21.1. Issue No. 1 - Whether the company had allotted equity shares on 7 instances to 284 persons in aggregate during the period April 17, 2007 to December 15, 2007, as alleged in the SCN? 21.2. Issue No. 2 - If so, whether the said offer / allotment of shares was in violation of Sections 56, 60 and 73 of Companies Act, 1956 and provisions of DIP Guidelines? 21.3. Issue No. 3 - If the findings on Issue No. 2 are found in the affirmative, who are liable for the violations committed? Issue No. 1- Whether the company had allotted equity shares on 7 instances to 284 persons in aggregate during the period April 17, 2007 to December 15, 2007, as  Order in the matter of Aakruti Nirmiti Limited                                                                                  Page 14 of 46 alleged in the SCN? 22. I have perused Form 2 (Return of allotment) submitted by the company and minutes of the Board Meeting where the agenda of allotment of shares was discussed by the Board of Directors. I note that neither the company nor the Promoters and Directors have disputed the fact of issuance of equity shares by the company on seven instances during the financial year 2007-2008. With respect to the issuance of equity shares by the company, from FORM 2 (Return of allotment), it is noted that company had issued equity shares, which are as under: Sr. No. Date of Allotment No. of Allottees Total Shares Allotted Nominal Value of allotment (in Rs.) 1 17/04/2007 43 24,24,000 2,52,40,000 2 18/05/2007 45 29,91,002 2,99,10,020 3 25/05/2007 46 28,25,000 2,82,50,000 4 31/05/2007 47 25,50,000 2,55,00,000 5 26/06/2007 45 31,25,000 3,12,50,000 6 18/09/2007 46 32,31,815 3,23,18,150 7 15/12/2007 12 1,16,90,000 11,69,00,000  Total 284 2,98,36,817 29,83,68,170  23. From the above, I note that company had issued equity shares and had mobilised funds to the tune of Rs. 29.83 crore from 284 allottees during the Financial Year 2007-2008. Thus, I am of the view that the company had issued and allotted equity shares in the financial year 2007-08.  24. The company has submitted that allotment at the relevant time was made to 278 allottees and not to 284 allottees. There were six individuals who had transferred their shares whose details have been included in the number of 284 allottees. In this regard, I have perused Form 2 submitted by the company which has list of allottees annexed to it. The name of the five individuals out of six, the exception being Mr. Vithal Shamji Patel, do not appear in the list of allottees. Further, the company has not submitted any documentary evidence to substantiate its claim that shares were transferred by the five individuals, who as per available records,  Order in the matter of Aakruti Nirmiti Limited                                                                                  Page 15 of 46 are not part of the Promoter Group viz, when were the shares allotted to them, when and to whom, they have transferred the shares etc. Moreover, the name of the sixth individual namely Mr. Vithal Shamji Patel, does appear in the list of allottees of company. Thus, the submission of the company that the list of allottees as submitted by the company includes the name of six transferors, is not acceptable. It is also noted that even if the submission of the company is taken on record, I note that once the company has made offer / allotment of shares to more than 49 persons, for the purpose of determination whether the said offer / allotment of shares by the company falls within the ambit of Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956, transfer of shares by the allottees, once the offer has been accepted by the allottees, is not a relevant criteria prescribed under the law.   25. I, therefore, conclude that the company had allotted equity shares to 284 persons during the period April 17, 2007 to December 15, 2007 as outlined above. Issue No. 2- If so, whether the said offer / allotment of shares was in violation of Sections 56, 60 and 73 of Companies Act, 1956 and provisions of DIP Guidelines? 26. The provisions alleged to have been violated and mentioned in Issue No. 2 are applicable to the offer / allotment of equity shares made to the public. Therefore, the primary question that arises for consideration is whether the allotment of equity shares as outlined under Issue No. 1 is a \\\\\\\\u2018public issue\\\\\\\\u2019.  At this juncture, reference may be made to Sections 67(1), 67 (2) and 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956:  \"67. (1) Any reference in this Act or in the articles of a company to offering shares or debentures to the public shall, subject to any provision to the contrary contained in this Act and subject also to the provisions of sub-sections (3) and (4), be construed as including a reference to offering them to any section of the public, whether selected as members or debenture holders of the company concerned or as clients of the person issuing the prospectus or in any other manner.  (2) Any reference in this Act or in the articles of a company to invitations to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures shall, subject as aforesaid, be construed as including a reference to invitations to subscribe for them extended to any section  Order in the matter of Aakruti Nirmiti Limited                                                                                  Page 16 of 46 of the public, whether selected as members or debenture holders of the company concerned or as clients of the person issuing the prospectus or in any other manner. (3) No offer or invitation shall be treated as made to the public by virtue of sub- section (1) or sub- section (2), as the case may be, if the offer or invitation can properly be regarded, in all the circumstances- (a) as not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation; or (b) otherwise as being a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer or invitation \\\\\\\\u2026  Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall apply in a case where the offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or debentures is made to fifty persons or more: Provided further that nothing contained in the first proviso shall apply to non-banking financial companies or public financial institutions specified in section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956).\\\\\\\\u201d  27. On perusal of Section 67(1) of the Companies Act, 1956, I note that the said Section provides for a rule of construction on offer / allotment of shares and debenture to the public. The said provision further subjects the rule of construction to the provisions of sub-sections (3) and (4) of 67 of the Companies Act, 1956. Therefore, the test for determining whether an offer / allotment of shares is made to public by applying the rule of construction in Section 67(1) of the Companies Act, 1956 needs to be read together with Sections 67(3) and 67(4) of the Companies Act, 1956.

Aansal Securities Services Private Limited  AAFCA3926K  (The above entities are individually referred to by their corresponding names/numbers and collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d)  BACKGROUND- 1) Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) conducted investigation into trading activities in the scrip of Secunderabad Healthcare Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Company/SHL\\\\\\\\u201d) for the period November 01, 2011 to January 15, 2015 (hereinafter referred as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Investigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d). The shares of the Company are listed on BSE India Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBSE\\\\\\\\u201d) since February 26, 2001.  2) Based on the findings of the investigation, a common Show Cause Notice dated July 19, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe SCN/Notice\\\\\\\\u201d) was  issued to the Noticees asking them to show cause as to why appropriate directions  should not be issued against them under Sections 11(1), 11B and 11(4) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 ( hereinafter referred__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in the matter of Secunderabad Healthcare Limited                                        Page 2 of 24                       to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe SEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) for committing  violations of Section 12A(a),(b),(c) of the SEBI Act, 1992, regulation 3(a),(b),(c),(d) and 4(1) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe PFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) and regulations 77(1) and 77(3) of the SEBI(Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe ICDR Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d).  3) The brief findings of the investigation and the allegations made on the basis of the said findings, as contained in the SCN, are as under:  3.1 SHL had allotted 8,00,00,000 warrants convertible into 8,00,00,000 equity shares of INR 10 each for cash at a premium of INR 8.60 per share on preferential basis to 27 non-promoter entities on October 14, 2010 on the following terms of payment: (a) At least 25% shall be payable before the allotment of warrants and balance on or before 18 months from the date of allotment or else the money received for the allotment of warrants shall be forfeited by the Company. (b) In the event convertible warrants are issued, the same shall at the option of the allottee, be converted into equivalent number of equity shares in one or more tranches but before expiry of 18 months from the date of allotment. 3.2 Upon first tranche of conversion of warrants to shares, SHL allotted 4,00,96,000 equity shares to 13 entities (including the Noticee nos. 2, 3, 4 and 9) on March 2, 2011 and the said shares were under lock-in till March 1, 2012. Pursuant to second tranche of conversion of warrants into shares on March 31, 2012, SHL allotted 3,99,04,000 equity shares to 16 entities (including the Noticee nos. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10) and the said shares were also under lock-in till March 30, 2013. 3.3 From the analysis of the information gathered during the investigation including the information provided by SHL vide its email dated September 10, 2018 regarding the funds received from 15 out of the 27 allottees, it was observed that there were variations (i.e. either excess or shortage of amounts due to refunds of money by the Company to allottees) in the funds received from certain allottees. SHL was asked to furnish detailed information in this regard, however, no sufficient information was provided regarding such variations despite being advised to provide information regarding such variations by SEBI on a few occasions.  3.4 For the remaining 12 allottees, SHL provided information only with regard to receipt of 25% of the consideration towards the preferential allotment of warrants and did not provide information regarding the receipt of the balance 75% of the consideration from__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in the matter of Secunderabad Healthcare Limited                                        Page 3 of 24                       these 12 allottees towards the final allotment of shares upon conversion of warrants issued under the said preferential allotment.  3.5 In view of the above, it has been alleged in the SCN that 9 allottees i.e., SKR Supreme Electronics & Trading Private Limited (Noticee no. 2), Nishottam Traders Private Limited (Noticee no. 3), Hamraj Fashions Consultants Private Limited (Noticee no. 4), Nu Pharmalogics Private Limited (Noticee no. 5), Jabeen Tradelink Private Limited (Noticee no. 6), Gajpal Buildinfra Private Limited (Noticee no. 7), Nirvana Mall Management Co. Private Limited (Noticee no. 8), Anvita Trading Co. Private Limited (Noticee no. 9), Aansal Securities Services Private Limited (Noticee no. 10) had received equity shares allotted to them by the Company post conversion of warrants, without paying the full consideration. Since, the said allottees did not pay full consideration for the conversion of warrants to equity shares, the said allottees were benefited by the Company causing loss to the other shareholders of the Company.    3.6 It is further noticed that 8 out of the said 9 allottees i.e. the Noticee nos. 2 to 9 were enjoying connection to the Noticee no. 1(the Company) i.e., SHL/promoters of SHL through a network of common directors. 3.7 It has been further noticed that 5 out of the said 9 allottees i.e., the Noticee nos. 2,3,6,7 and 8 had traded in the scrip of SHL wherein the Noticee no. 2 sold all the shares received post conversion of warrants issued in the preferential allotment, whereas the Noticee nos. 3,6,7 and 8 have not sold the entire shares. Further, the Noticee nos. 2 and 3 had unlawfully gained INR 10.57 Crore through sell of those shares received by them from the Company for which no consideration was paid.  3.8 It has also been noticed that although the Company at that time gave a public impression of capital infusion through preferential allotment, in reality, the Company, inter-alia, allotted shares to the said 9 allottees out of 27 allottees without receiving full consideration from them thereby providing huge amount of monetary benefit to them and therefore, SHL along with 9 allottees have perpetrated a fraud on the other allottees, shareholders and the ordinary investing public who had transacted in the shares of the Company post preferential allotment.

In response to the SCN, the Noticee no. 9 vide its email dated October 14, 2020 has forwarded a copy of its reply dated October 1, 2020.  Further, on the scheduled date of hearing held through Video Conferencing, the Noticee no. 9 appeared through its Authorized Representative and made oral submissions on the lines of its earlier reply dated October 1, 2020. The submissions of the Noticee no. 9 made through written reply as well as oral arguments advanced before me are summarized as under: 6.1 The payment details in respect of it as provided by SHL are factually incorrect.  6.2 It had subscribed for 36,25,000 shares at the issue price of INR 8.60 per share and the total required amount for subscription of 36,25,000 shares was INR 6,74,25,000.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in the matter of Secunderabad Healthcare Limited                                        Page 6 of 24                       6.3 As per the terms of the preferential allotment, it had paid full consideration of INR 6,74,25,000 by February 26, 2011. Thereafter, the above 36,25,000 shares were allotted to it on March 02, 2011.   6.4 Based on the rightful legal ownership, it has sold shares to others, which it has full right to do so and the profit/loss generated from such transactions rightfully belongs to it only and no one else has rightful claim over it. 6.5 It has not received any unlawful benefit from the said share allotment and is not a party to such perpetrated fraud on the other allottees, shareholders and the ordinary investing public who had transacted in the shares of the Company post preferential allotment.  CONSIDERATION  7) I have perused the findings recorded in the SCN, the submissions advanced on behalf of the Noticee no. 9 and the other materials available on record. In my view, the only issue that needs adjudication in the present proceedings is whether or not, the Noticee no. 2 to 10 have received equity shares allotted to them by the Noticee no. 1(the Company) post conversion of the warrants, after paying the full consideration for the said shares allotted to them, to the Company? If the answer to the aforesaid issue is in negative, then it would automatically follow that;  (a) The Noticee no. 1(the Company) has provided undue monetary benefit to the Noticee nos. 2 to 10 thereby causing loss to the other shareholders of the Company and therefore, the Noticee no. 1 along with the Noticee nos. 2 to 10 have perpetuated a fraud on the other allottees, shareholders and the ordinary investing public within the ambit of the PFUTP Regulations and  (b) The Noticee nos. 2 and 3 have made unlawful gains amounting to INR 10.57 Crore by selling shares for which no adequate consideration was paid.   8) Before adverting to the factual conspectus of the case, I note that the Noticees have been alleged to have violated applicable provisions of SEBI Act, 1992, the PFUTP Regulations and the ICDR Regulations. Therefore, the said provisions are reproduced hereunder for ease of reference and better appreciation: The SEBI Act, 1992  Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control. 12A. No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in the matter of Secunderabad Healthcare Limited                                        Page 7 of 24                       (a)  use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;    (b) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange;   (c) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; The PFUTP Regulations, 2003 3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities No person shall directly or indirectly \\\\\\\\u2013  (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under; (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange;  (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under. 4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1)  Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a manipulative, fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities markets. Explanation.\\\\\\\\u2013For  the  removal  of  doubts,  it  is  clarified  that  any  act  of  diversion, misutilization or siphoning off of assets or earnings of a company whose securities are listed or any  concealment of such act or any device, scheme or artifice to manipulate the books of accounts or financial statement of such a company that would directly or indirectly manipulate the price of securities of that company shall be and shall always be  deemed  to  have  been  considered  as  manipulative,  fraudulent  and  an  unfair  trade practice in the securities market. The SEBI(ICDR) Regulations, 2009 Payment of consideration. 77. (1) Full consideration of specified securities other than warrants issued under this Chapter shall be paid by the allottees at the time of allotment of such specified securities:__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in the matter of Secunderabad Healthcare Limited                                        Page 8 of 24                        Provided that in case of a preferential issue of specified securities pursuant to a scheme of corporate debt restructuring as per the corporate debt restructuring framework specified by the Reserve Bank of India, the allottee may pay the consideration in terms of such scheme. (2) An amount equivalent to at least twenty-five per cent. of the consideration determined in terms of regulation 76 shall be paid against each warrant on the date of allotment of warrants. (3) The balance seventy-five per cent of the consideration shall be paid at the time of allotment of equity shares pursuant to exercise of option against each such warrant by the warrant holder.  9) Before dealing with the merits of the allegations levelled against the Noticees in the SCN, I find it necessary to first deal with the conduct of the Noticees during the investigation and the proceedings before me.  10) The SCN states that though the Noticee no. 1 had, vide email dated September 10, 2018, provided certain details regarding the funds received from 15 out of the 27 allottees, but failed to provide details regarding the variations noticed (i.e. excess or shortage of  amounts due to refunds of money made by the Company to allottees) in the funds received from certain allottees despite being advised by SEBI to provide such details regarding such variations for better understanding of the funds transfers by the allottees /payment of considerations made by the allottees towards the shares allotted to them by the Company . It is further stated in the SCN that for the remaining 12 allottees, the Company provided information only with regard to receipt of 25% of the consideration towards the preferential allotment of warrants and did not provide information with supporting evidence regarding the receipt of the balance 75% of the consideration from these 12 allottees towards the final allotment of shares upon conversion of those warrants. I note from the records that since the Company did not provide information regarding the payment details with respect to the said 12 allottees, vide email dated January 16, 2019 and reminder email dated January 25, 2019, the 12 allottees were advised to provide the information pertaining to the details of payment made by them to the Company against the preferential allotment of warrants and thereafter on conversion of the said warrants into equity shares by the Company. However, no reply was received from any of these 12 allottees.     11) Further, it is noted that summons dated September 21, 2018 was issued under section 11C (2) and 11C (3) of the SEBI Act to the Company seeking information in respect of the total funds received from each of the 27 preferential allottees as well as explanation with respect to the variations noticed in the amounts of funds received from certain allottees. The said summons was delivered to the Company on September 27, 2018 but the Company failed to provide any information sought vide the above summons.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in the matter of Secunderabad Healthcare Limited                                        Page 9 of 24                       12) It is no one\\\\\\\\u2019s guess that the aforesaid details sought by SEBI with respect to the purchase considerations received from the allottees of warrants/shares were fundamental and critical for the determination of the issues in the investigation and the failure of the Company to provide the said details has severely impeded the entire investigation process. It is of paramount importance that every person, (including the Noticee no. 1 which is a listed company) from whom information is sought by issuance of a summons or otherwise, should fully cooperate with the Investigating Officer and promptly produce all documents, records, information as may be necessary for the investigations. If persons are allowed to disobey the summons issued to them during the course of the investigations, SEBI as the watchdog of the Securities Market will not be able to perform its duties in protecting the interests of the investors and safeguarding the integrity of the Securities Market as mandated under the SEBI Act. Thus, non-cooperation with the market regulator cannot be viewed with leniency.  13) In this regard, I find that Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), while recognizing the importance of compliance with summons and furnishing of the information called for therein, in the matter of DKG Buildcon Pvt. Ltd. v. SEBI (Appeal No. 106 of 2006, decided on January 07, 2009), has inter alia held that:  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026By not responding to the summons, the representative(s) of the appellant did not appear before the investigating officer as a result whereof their statements could not be recorded. This, obviously, hampered the investigations. In the result, the inescapable conclusion is that the appellants were adamant in not furnishing the information sought from them though vital to the investigations and that they stonewalled the investigations as commented by the adjudicating officer. It is of utmost importance that every person from whom information is sought should fully cooperate with the investigating officer and promptly produce all documents, records, information as may be necessary for the investigations. If persons are allowed to flout the summons issued to them during the course of the investigations, the Board as the watchdog of the securities market will not be able to perform its duties in protecting the interests of the investors and safeguarding the integrity of the securities market.\\\\\\\\u201d  14)  I would also like to refer to the decision of the Hon'ble SAT in the matter of Mr. Jalaj Batra vs. SEBI (Appeal no. 184 of 2010, decided on December 06, 2010) wherein it was observed that:  \"......We have observed time and again that it is of utmost importance that market players like the appellant should fully cooperate with the investigations that are carried out by the Board, the watchdog of the securities market. If market players and intermediaries avoid appearing before the investigating officer or furnish the necessary information sought from them, the Board as a market regulator will not be able to carry out its statutory functions and duties of protecting the integrity of the securities market and the investigations would be__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in the matter of Secunderabad Healthcare Limited                                        Page 10 of 24                       grossly hampered. Non-cooperation with the market regulator has to be viewed seriously. We do not know what else would have come to light if the appellant had appeared before the investigating officer or if he had furnished the requisite information that was sought from him.\" 15) It is noted that the Noticee no. 1 has duly received both the SCN and the hearing notice however, neither did it participate in the investigation and submitted those information as called for by the Investigation Officer nor did it participate and file the details of such basic facts in the proceedings before me despite being aware that the SCN has pointed out its failure and non-cooperation in furnishing such essential information called from it. Talking of the other Noticees I also note that a copy of the SCN along with its annexures was sent by SEBI vide email dated September 11, 2020 to the existing email address of the Noticee no. 3. Thereafter, the Noticee no. 3 vide email dated October 24, 2020 requested for a copy of SCN and annexures to be sent to a separate email address as provided by it. Accordingly, a copy of SCN along with its annexures was delivered to the Noticee no. 3 vide email dated November 18, 2020 at the separate email address as provided by it and delivered the hearing notice as well at the said email address, however,  it is noted that the Noticee no. 3 has also neither filed its reply to the SCN nor  has availed opportunity of personal hearing to offer any explanation in its defense or advance any arguments in rebuttal of any of  the allegations made in the SCN.    16) It is also noted from the records that the hearing notice and the SCN were served on the Noticee no. 5 by way of newspaper publication on February 15, 2021. Subsequently, the Noticee no. 5 vide email dated February 20, 2021 confirmed having noticed the aforesaid newspaper publication and requested for a copy of SCN and its annexures. Interestingly from the records it is noted that earlier, a copy of the SCN and Annexures had been sent on September 11, 2020 to the same email address of the Noticee no. 5 before making the Newspaper publication through which the Noticee has confirmed having seen the newspaper publication of  the hearing notice, but no reply was received from the Noticee at that time when the SCN was served on him through the said email address. Nevertheless, SEBI vide its email dated February 22, 2021 forwarded the requested documents again to the said email address from which the said request was made by Noticee no. 5. However, I note that the Noticee no. 5 has chosen again not to file any reply to the SCN on merit and has even preferred to abstain from personal hearing despite being duly served with hearing notice and SCN in this regard.  17)  As regards the Noticee no. 10, it is noted that after receiving the SCN, the said Noticee, vide its email dated October 24, 2020 requested for additional time to file its reply. Subsequently, the hearing notice was also served on the Noticee no. 10 through email address from which request for additional time for filing a reply to the SCN was earlier received from it. Thus, it is noted that despite being served with the SCN and hearing notice, the Noticee no 10 has neither filed__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in the matter of Secunderabad Healthcare Limited                                        Page 11 of 24                       its reply to the SCN on merits nor has attended the personal hearing. In respect of the Noticee nos. 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8 also, I note that they have neither filed any reply to the SCN nor have availed the opportunity of personal hearing despite being legitimately served with the SCN and hearing notice, the details of which have already been mentioned in Table no.1 and 2 above.  18) There cannot be any doubt that the investigation is a fact finding process and a vital tool for gathering relevant facts and information so as to help in identifying all the pertinent issues confronting the Investigation Officer, based on which the veracity of complaints and allegations can be determined and charges, if any, can be framed accordingly. Despite being a listed company, SHL has shown utter disregard for regulatory framework and its conduct of non cooperations with the investigation carried out by SEBI to ascertain the transactions involving allotment of warrants and shares by it, in my considered view, smacks of the defiant attitude and callousness and as well as non-compliant nature of the Company and such attitude and unbecoming conduct by listed entities can adversely impact the functioning of SEBI to maintain integrity and facilitate orderly development of Securities Market. I note that the failure to furnish the basic minimum information by the Company and some of the other Noticees have hampered the investigation since the complete details with respect to the funds received by the Company from the other Noticees towards the allotment of shares made to them or otherwise, could not be gathered as a result of which investigation had to be concluded based on whatever information/documents were available on records. Further, even during the personal hearing none of the Noticees except for the Noticee no. 9 appeared thereby reinforcing their non-cooperative stand once again and obstructing the last opportunity available before me to unravel the truth/basic facts pertaining to the allegations of non-payment or partial payment of considerations against the shares allotted by the Company to them  which constrains me to conclude that these Noticees  apparently  have nothing substantial to offer in response to the allegations made against them and have no explanation or evidence to offer in rebuttal to the said allegation, which in effect  amounts to admission of commission of those violations alleged in the SCN. 19) Having made the aforesaid observations on the irresponsible conduct of the Noticees as reflected in their non-compliant behaviour, I now proceed further to discuss the case on merits. In this regard, I note from the SCN that the allegation against the Noticees is that the Noticee nos. 2 to 10 had received equity shares allotted to them by the Noticee no. 1(the Company) post conversion of warrants for which adequate consideration was not paid to the Noticee no. 1 and thus the Noticee nos. 2 to 10 were benefited by the Noticee no. 1 at the cost of other shareholders of the Company. Subsequently, the Noticee nos. 2,3,6,7 and 8 were also found to have traded in the scrip of the Company wherein the Noticee nos. 2 and 3 by selling those shares__________________________________________________________________________________________ Final Order in the matter of Secunderabad Healthcare Limited                                        Page 12 of 24                       received by them in the preferential allotment made to them by the company against   which no consideration was paid by them to the company, have gained unlawfully a sum of INR 10.57 Crore from such sale. The aforesaid acts of the Noticees have been alleged to be in violation of Section 12A(a),(b),(c) of the SEBI Act, 1992, regulation 3(a),(b),(c),(d) and 4(1) of the PFUTP Regulations and regulations 77(1) and 77(3) of the ICDR Regulations.  20) In this respect, I find the SCN provides the details of preferential allotment of warrants, conversions of warrants into equity shares, allotment of equity shares to the Noticees, total consideration allottees were required to pay to the Noticee no. 1 against which actual payment made by the Noticees allottees to the Noticee no. 1 (against the warrants/ equity shares pursuant to conversion of warrants) which are summarised here under:  Table no.-3 Noticee No.  Preferrential Allotees/ Noticee no.

The company is into Jewellery Business and has operations in various states including Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra. It also has operations in Middle East. Further, it is observed from the shareholding pattern of the Company that, as on March 31, 2014, there were 9 shareholders of the Company, and it is also observed that 49,940 shares i.e. 99.88% of total shares were held by Mr. Chemmanur Devassykkutty Boby akaPage 4 of 74  CD Boby, Promoter and Director of CGPIL. The shareholding pattern of the Company is placed at Annexure 3. iii. It is observed that, from July, 2012 till March, 2015, the company had allotted 6% PPS of Rs. 1000/- each. The said PPS were redeemable and non-convertible preference shares. These 6% PPS were issued in multiple tranche with a small gap of about 2-4 days between any two allottment. It is alleged that, by virtue of having very few equity shareholders with CD Boby holding 99.88% shares, Extraordinary General Meetings (EGMs) were convened at short notices and frequent intervals and a total of 115 allotments were made by help of resolutions passed in those EGMs. Thus, it is observed that there was one EGM on almost every 5th day wherein special resolutions were passed authorizing increase of Authorized Share Capital and authorizing the issue along with the board resolutions for allotment. iv. A summary of the allotments pursuant to each ordinary resolution for enhancement is as below: Table 1 Date of enabling ordinary resolution {S 94 and S 81(1A)} for increasing authorised capital & authorising board to issue No of allotments pursuant to such resolution No of allottees pursuant to such resolution Total no. of Pref. shares issued Total funds raised 09-06-2012 31 1435 3,86,544 38,65,44,000 19-01-2013 16 744 1,87,265 18,72,65,000 08-04-2013 3 146 5,16,242 51,62,42,000 30-04-2013 27 1290 13,13,026 1,31,30,26,000 20-09-2013 15 727 1,88,695 18,86,95,000 30-11-2013 8 392 1,05,829 10,58,29,000 06-01-2014 7 341 95,702 9,57,02,000 17-02-2014 7 248 89,525 8,95,25,000 Grand Total 114 5323 28,82,828 2,88,28,28,000 A complete detailed data of the allotments pursuant to each ordinary resolution is placed at Annexure 4. The filings with ROC are placed at Annexure 5. v. In terms of Section 67 of Companies Act, 1956, any offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or debentures made to fifty persons or more is considered as public issue. In light of the frequency and time span between such allotments coupled with the series of allotments made pursuant to a few resolutions passed in the General Meetings authorizing such issuances, as mentioned above, and that the authorised share capital were revised multiple times to accommodate such fund raising (vide ordinary resolution (S 94 and S 81(1A) for increasing authorisedPage 5 of 74  capital & authorising board to raise capital) in the present matter, it is alleged that the allotments were made to circumvent the provisions of law regarding public issue of shares. Therefore, it is alleged that all the allotments, made pursuant to the single resolution passed in a General Meeting, amount to single offer/issue. In view of this, the number of allottees in total far exceeded the limits for private placement per each ordinary resolution and, therefore, it is alleged that the mode of issuance of 6% PPS by the company is nothing but a public issue. vi. In this regard, it is observed that a company, making a public issue of shares and debentures, is required to fulfil the following conditions for the said allotment of shares or debentures: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In terms of Section 73 of Companies Act, 1956, the Company was required to apply for listing permission with any of the stock exchanges for the said public issuance of preference shares; \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In terms of Section 56 of the Companies Act, 1956, the company was required to make certain disclosures in the Prospectus or abridged prospectus for the said allotments; \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In terms of Section 60 of Companies Act, 1956, the company was required to register the Prospectus with Registrar of Companies before making their public issue. vii. However, it is alleged that CGPIL has failed to fulfil any of the above-mentioned conditions before the allotment of PPS. Therefore, it is alleged that the public issue of PPS by CGPIL is in violation of Section 56, 60, 67 and 73 of the Companies Act, 1956. viii. In this regard, it is observed that SEBI had notified NCRPS Regulations on June 12, 2013, which is applicable for all the public issue of non-convertible redeemable preference shares. Apart from the public issue requirements of Companies Act, 1956, any company making public issue of redeemable preference shares, needs to comply with following Regulations: Table 2: Relevant provisions of NCRPS Regulations S.No Regulation no. Regulatory requirement 1 Regulation 4(2)(a) Application for listing of securities 2 Regulation 4(2)(b) In principle approval for listing of Securities 3 Regulation 4(2)(c) Credit rating to be obtained from a Credit Rating Agency 4 Regulation 4(5) Appointment of Merchant Banker 5 Regulation 5 Disclosure requirements in offer documentPage 6 of 74  6 Regulation 6 Filing of Draft Offer Document with Stock Exchanges 7 Regulation 8 Mandatory advertisement for Public Issues 8 Regulation 9 Disclosure in Abridged Prospectus and application forms 9 Regulation 16 Mandatory listing of Securities post issuance Thus, CGPIL was required to comply with NCRPS Regulations for every public offer/issue of securities made by it after June 12, 2013. In this regard, details of allotments made by CGPIL after June 12, 2013 which are alleged to be deemed public issue/offer are given below: Table 3: Details of PPS allotment made to public after June 12, 2013 Date of enabling ordinary resolution {S 94 and S 81(1A)} for increasing authorised capital & authorising board to issue No of allotments pursuant to such resolution No of allottees pursuant to such resolution Total no. of Pref. shares issued Total funds raised 20-09-2013 15 727 1,88,695 18,86,95,000 30-11-2013 8 392 1,05,829 10,58,29,000 06-01-2014 7 341 95,702 9,57,02,000 17-02-2014 8 248 89,525 8,95,25,000 Grand Total 38 1708 4,79,751 47,97,51,000 In this regard, it is alleged that for the abovementioned allotment of PPS, which were allegedly public issues, CGPIL has failed to comply with the requirements of NCRPS Regulations, as mentioned in Table above. Therefore, it is alleged that the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 4(2)(a), 4(2)(b), 4(2)(c), 4(5), 5, 6, 8, 9 and 16 of NCRPS Regulations. ix. It is further noted that, out of the total allotments to about 5323 persons for an amount of about Rs. 288.28 crores, allotment to the tune of Rs. 152 crores were made in the name of the promoter of the company CD Boby. The details of allotment are placed at Annexure 6. Subsequent to this allotment, CD Boby had offered and sold most of these 6% PPS allotted to him to more than 7488 investors in the FY 2013-14 and 2014-15 as detailed below: Table 4 Year of offer for sale Date of registration of Share Transfers by the company No. of transferees Total No. of Pref. shares transferred 2013-14 05-07-2013 1790 339624 13-05-2013 635 142810 14-06-2013 1204 306597Page 7 of 74  17-05-2013 1088 242069 22-06-2013 1481 287596 28-01-2014 15 5550 31-03-2014 7 2180 18-03-2014 31 21500 22-03-2014 242 71165 2013-14 TOTAL  6493 14,19,091 2014-15 08-07-2014 210 71785 14-06-2014 354 104834 18-08-2014 255 81265 20-06-2014 173 46498 Other dates 3 750 2014-15 TOTAL  995 3,05,112 GRAND TOTAL  7488 17,24,203 The details of transfer of the shares is placed at Annexure 7. x. Thus, in view of the above, the number of investors to whom the company has directly allotted and to whom PPS were offered and sold through the promoter aggregates to about 12,813 (twelve thousand eight hundred and thirteen only). xi. Regarding the transfer of shares by the promoter Shri CD Boby, it is observed from the said examination that CD Boby had acted as counter party to those investors of PPS who wanted to invest/exit these investments. Consequently, during 2013-14 to 2014-15 CD Boby sold these PPS worth Rs. 172 crores and bought about Rs. 38 crores of PPS to and from the general public. The details of allotment of preference shares- received by CD Boby from the company and sales/ offer to the public is plotted as a table below: Table 5: Details of allotment to CD Boby and sales/offer to the public Date of allotment to promoter No. of PPS allotted Cumulative number of preference shares allotted Year of offer for sale Date of registration of Share Transfers by the company No. of transferees Total of Pref. shares transferred Cumulative number of preference shares transferred 16-Apr-13 1,50,000 1,50,000 FY 2013-14 13-05-2013 635 1,42,810 1,42,810 22-Apr-13 3,30,000 4,80,000 17-05-2013 1,088 2,42,069 3,84,879 12-Jun-13 5,00,000 9,80,000 14-06-2013 1,204 3,06,597 6,91,476 03-Jul-13 4,60,000 14,40,000 22-06-2013 1,481 2,87,596 9,79,072    05-07-2013 1,790 3,39,624 13,18,696    28-01-2014 15 5,550 13,24,246    18-03-2014 31 21,500 13,45,746    22-03-2014 242 71,165 14,16,911Page 8 of 74     31-03-2014 7 2,180 14,19,091    2013-14 TOTAL 6,493 14,19,091      14-06-2014 354 1,04,834 15,23,925     20-06-2014 173 46,498 15,70,423     08-07-2014 210 71,765 16,42,188     18-08-2014 255 81,265 17,23,453 05-Mar-15 30,000 14,70,000  Other dates 3 750 17,24,203    2014-15 TOTAL 995 3,05,112          29-Apr-15 30,000 15,00,000      08-Jun-15 20,000 15,20,000         GRAND TOTAL 7,488 17,24,203  Thus, most of the preference shares thus allotted to CD Boby were further offered/sold to large number of investors with in a short span of time, often in less than six months from the date of allotment. xii. In this regard, it is noted that, as per Section 64 of the Companies Act, 1956, where a company allots or agrees to allot any shares in or debentures of the company with a view to all or any of those shares or debentures being offered for sale to the public, any document by which the offer for sale to the public is made shall, for all purposes, be deemed to be a prospectus issued by the company; and all enactments and rules of law as to the contents of prospectuses and as to liability in respect of statements in and omissions from prospectuses, or otherwise relating to prospectuses, shall apply with the modifications specified in sub-sections (3), and (5), and have effect accordingly, as if the shares or debentures had been offered to the public for subscription and as if persons accepting the offer in respect of any shares or debentures were subscribers for those shares or debentures, but without prejudice to the liability, if any, of the persons by whom the offer is made in respect of mis-statements contained in the document or otherwise in respect thereof. xiii. In this regard, Section 64(2) of Companies Act, 1956 reads as follows: For the purposes of this Act, it shall, unless the contrary is proved, be evidence that an allotment of, or an agreement to allot, shares or debentures was made with a view to the shares or debentures being offered for sale to the public if it is shown- a) that an offer of the shares or debentures or of any of them for sale to the public was made within six months after the allotment or agreement to allot; orPage 9 of 74  b) that at the date when the offer was made, the whole consideration to be received by the company in respect of the shares or debentures had not been received by it. Note: Similar provisions are covered under S 25 of the Companies Act 2013 (which became effective from April 1, 2014). Further, all the provisions concerning public issue of securities in Companies Act, 1956/2013 are equally applicable to Offer for Sale made to public. xiv. In the instant case, as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, CGPIL had issued PPS to the tune of Rs. 152 crores to the promoter CD Boby. Subsequently, CD Boby offered and sold most of these PPS, allotted to him, to more than 7488 investors in the FY 2013-14 and 2014-15. as detailed in Table above. Thus, most of the PPS thus allotted to the promoter were further offered/ sold to large number of investors with in a short span of time, often in less than six months from the date of allotment.  xv. The details of payment of Application money as submitted by CD Boby is placed at Annexure 8. xvi. SEBI further conducted an analysis of receipt of funds from the allotment of PPS to CD Boby using the account details of the bank accounts of the company (The Federal Bank Limited /14130200012846) and Chemmanur International Jewellers (promoter entity- The Federal Bank Limited/1413020000144 and Catholic Syrian Bank Ltd./ 0342-02802468-195001). On the basis of the said analysis, it is alleged that there were no actual payment of application money was made by CD Boby for at least 9,40,000 shares amounting to Rs. 94 crore. It is further alleged that, of the total application money transferred by CD Boby to the tune of Rs. 152 crore, Rs. 94 crore were reversed/ returned as per the table below: Table 6: Details of fund transfer between entities controlled by CD Boby and CGPIL payment for preference shares by CD Bpby to the account of Chemmnanur -Gold Palace International with Federal \\\\\\\\u25a0 Bank Account No. 14130200012846 From Account 1 * From Account 2 Comment Date Amount Instrument No. Account Name Account No. Instrument No. Date Amount Account Name Account No.Page 10 of 74  31-05-2013 1200,00,000 10069419 Chemmanur International Jewellers FDRL 14130200001443 10094450 31-05-2013 1200,00,000 CGPIL 14130200012846 Funds lying with CGPIL routed through promoter related entities and shown as application money   04-06-2013 1300,00,000 10069420 Chemmanur International Jewellers FDRL 14130200001443 10094451 31-05-2013 1300,00,000 CGPIL 14130200012846 25-06-2013 1900,00,000 10069423 Chemmanur International Jewellers FDRL 14130200001443 10094462 24-06-2013 1900,00,000 CGPIL 14130200012846 02-07-2013 1000,00,000 10069425 Chemmanur International Jewellers FDRL 14130200001443 10094465 01-07-2013 1000,00,000 CGPIL 14130200012846 08-06-2013 1450,00,000 10069421 Chemmanur International Jewellers FDRL 14130200001443 10094454 08-06-2013 1450,00,000 CGPIL 14130200012846 04-06-2013 500,00,000 199050 Chemmanur International Jewellers CSB 0342- 0280246 8-195001 FDRLH13 15705657 9 IFSC- FDRL000 1413 06-06-2013 500,00,000 CGPIL 14130200012846 07-06-2013 350,00,000 CSBKH13 158000356 Chemmanur International Jewellers CSB 0342- 0280246 8-195001 FDRLH13 161081887--1009445 10-06-2013 350,00,0000 CGPIL  14130200012846 17-06-2013 1600,00,000 502679 Chemmanur International Jewellers CSB 0342- 0280246 8-195001 10094459  FDRLH13 166044948 15-06-2013 1600,00,000 CGPIL 14130200012846 18-06-2013 100,00,000 10069422 Chemmanur International Jewellers FDRL 1413020 0001443 10094465 01-07-2013 100,00,000 CGPIL 14130200012846 Total 94,00,00,000    Bank statements of CGPIL and Chemmanur International Jewellers is placed at Annexure 9. xvii. Thus, in view of the above table, it is alleged that application money of Rs. 94 crore, paid by CD Boby, was paid from account(s) of Chemmanur International Jewellers (a partnership firm controlled by CD Boby) which were allegedly fictitious payments, created out of multiple tranches of circular transfers from the money already existed in the company\\\\\\\\u2019s bank account routed through the firms/ partnership entities owned by CD Boby. Therefore, with respect to offer for sales by promoter CD Boby, it is alleged that the date when the offer was made, the whole consideration to be received by the company in respect of the shares or debentures had not been received by it in real terms. xviii. In this regard, the following were noted w.r.t the alleged Offer for Sale made by CD Boby in this case:Page 11 of 74  a. The transfers made by CD Boby from (13-05-2013 to 05-07- 2013) were made within 6 months of the original allotment to him. The transfers were made to more than fifty persons and these transfers were allegedly made on a single day. b. As mentioned in previous paragraphs, it is alleged that promoter\\\\\\\\u2019s application money of Rs. 94 crore was paid from Bank Account of Chemmanur International Jewellers (a partnership firm controlled by promoter CD Boby) which were alleged to be fictitious payments, created out of multiple tranches of circular transfers from the money already-existed in the company\\\\\\\\u2019s bank account routed through the firms/partnership entities owned by CD Boby. Therefore, with respect to alleged offer for sales by the promoter, it is alleged that the date on which the offer was made, the whole consideration to be received by CGPIL in respect of the shares or debentures had not been received by it in real terms. c. The Offer & Sale were made to about 7488 investors, which far exceeds the maximum of 50 allottees for each transfer in FY 2013-14, during which Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956 was applicable and exceeds the cap of 200 allottees in a financial year in the FY 2014-15, during which Companies Act, 2013 is applicable. d. The entire scheme of the things (the initial allotment by the company to the Promoter and subsequent offer for sale by the Promoter to public, for which the transfers are registered by the company) is with the consent of the company and as mentioned above, CD Boby was holding more than 99% of the Equity shares of the company at the relevant time. In view of this, it is alleged that the abovementioned Offer and Sale of PPS made by CD Boby was nothing but an offer for sale to public and, therefore, is to be treated as public offer made by the promoter CD Boby in connivance with the company and is a public offer in terms of Section 64(2) of Companies Act, 1956 read with Section 25(2) of Companies Act, 2013. xix. As alleged above, the company has failed to apply for listing permission with any of the stock exchanges, has failed to make disclosures in the Prospectus or abridged prospectus and has failed to register the Prospectus with Registrar of Companies before making their public offer of PPS. xx. Thus, it is alleged that the offer for sale by Shri CD Boby, in connivance with CGPIL, to the public were in contravention to Section 64 of the Companies Act 1956 and Section 25 of Companies Act 2013 (in cases of offers made after AprilPage 12 of 74  1, 2014) and fall in the nature of deemed public issue and the company has failed to comply with Sections 2(36), 56(1), 56(3), 60, 64 and 73 of the Companies Act, 1956 read with section 465, 25, 26, 28, 33 (1) and 40 of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to these offer for sale of the preference shares to public. xxi. Further, as mentioned in pre-paragraphs, public issue/offer of Non- Convertible Redeemable Preference Shares made by CGPIL after June 12, 2013 were required to comply with the provisions of NCRPS Regulations, as listed in Table 2 above. In this regard, it is alleged that CGPIL has not complied with any of the said provisions with respect to Offer for Sale of Redeemable Preference Shares made on following dates to its promoter CD Boby: Table 7 Date of Offer for Sale 22-06-2013  05-07-2013 28-01-2014 18-03-2014 22-03-2014 31-03-2014 14-06-2014 20-06-2014 08-07-2014 18-08-2014 xxii. Therefore, it is alleged that CGPIL, by its failure to comply with the norms of NCRPS Regulations regarding the allotments made on the above-mentioned dates to CD Boby, has violated the provisions of Regulation 4(2)(a), 4(2) (b), 4(2) (c), 4 (5), 5, 6, 8, 9 and 16 of NCRPS Regulations.   6.

SEBI had upon receipt of complaint from a third party who is not even a \\\\\\\\xb7 shareholder in CGPIL, initiated inquiry into the affairs of the company and matters related to the issue of PPS since 4 August 2016 and enquired about why the aforesaid issue should not be deemed as a public issue vide SEBI Circular No CIRICFD/DIL3/18/2015 dated 31st December 2015.  3.

Considering the requirements of the aforesaid letter, the Company initiated the refund procedure for payment of 15% interest p.a to all PPS holders. In order to evidence the same to SEBI, the company had obtained due diligence report dated 23rd July 2018 from Mr V R Sankaranarayanan, Partner, KSR & Co Company Secretaries LLP, and Certificate dated 2ihJuly 2018 from Mr A any, Partner, Sankar & Moorthy, Chartered Accountants, [Annexure I] to elaborate the compliances regarding the issue and redemption of PPS.

There were absolutely no complaints.  8. The SEBI Letter of 29th March 2018 had advised the company to apply for compounding of alleged contraventions of specified provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. Though there are several provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 relating to prospectus, since the Company had at no point of time issued any document not even any circular none of the provisions was applicable. As However applications under Section 441 of the Companies Act, 2013 was filed with the Registrar of Companies on 4th October 2018, for compounding the alleged contraventions of Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956. It may be noted that under the Companies Act, 1956, the Registrar of Companies had not found any contravention in the allotments and had not initiated any action at all. Moreover, there were no complaints. Even when SEBI in its letter of 29th March 2018 advised the company to apply for compounding, there case was actually time barred. Further in view of coming into force of Section 42 of the Companies Act, 2013, the old provisions contained in the 1956 Act had become repealed ipso facto. The time limit for launching prosecutions for offences had also expired. Eventually, the Companies Act, 1956 itself came to be totally repealed with effect from the 30th January 2019.  9.

The DA issued a Show Cause Notice dated September 27, 2018 to the Noticee under Regulation 25 of the Intermediaries asking the Noticee to show cause to why action be not taken under Regulation 28 of the Intermediaries Regulations. In response to the same a written response was filed by the Noticee to the DA vide letter dated November 22, 2018. 4. The background facts necessary for the present proceedings are narrated in brief, hereunder:  i. The Noticee, Korp Securities Limited, is a stock-broker registered with SEBI and is/was a member of the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSEIL) and the BSE Ltd. (BSE).  ii.

Thus, effectively, Beejay remained under prohibition and restraint from accessing securities market, directly or indirectly, during the period of June 04, 2009 to November 14, 2012.  iii. It was however noticed in the investigation that the entities who were debarred vide the said interim order dated June 04, 2019, were in fact, indirectly trading in securities, through certain third-party entities viz., Divyadrishti Merchants Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cDDM\\\\\\\\u201d), Divyadrishti Traders Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cDDT\\\\\\\\u201d) and Neelanchal Mercantile Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNeelanchal\\\\\\\\u201d).

It was also noticed that that DDM had traded through the Noticee broker on September 02, 2011 on the BSE, whereas DDT had traded on October 12, 2011, through the Noticee broker on both the BSE and the NSEIL.  xv. During the investigation, DDM and DDT while explaining (vide letters dated May 26, 2015) the reasons for above noted fund transfers, have submitted that they had entered into certain transactions with Beejay during the period from September 01, 2011 to September 30, 2012 and the amounts so received by them (DDT and DDM) from Beejay were towards sale consideration of unlisted equity shares and the balance/ excess amount were repaid to Beejay by them. In this regard, based on the information_____________________________________________________________________________________  Order in respect of Korp Securities Limited in the matter of Beejay Investment & Financial Consultants Private Ltd. Page 9 of 35   gathered, the details of all the trades executed by DDT through the Noticee broker are summarised in the table below:  Table no. 6 No. of Scrips Buy Qty Total Buy Value (in Lakh) Sell Qty Total Sell Value (in Lakh) BSE 10 75,721 33,83 14,81,557 159,17 NSE 7 5,95,000 260.73 7,37,875 240.78  5.  On the basis of the aforesaid factual details, the DA, after considering the reply filed by the Noticee, has inter alia observed in his report as: \\\\\\\\u201cThus, through the aforementioned activities, it can be inferred that Beejay had transferred the funds (indirectly) to Korp, which facilitated the trades of Beejay by trading in the account of DDM & DDT. Therefore, also acted in a manner highly detrimental to the interests of the securities market. \\\\\\\\u2026. 64. As can be seen from above, it is an established fact that Beejay (a debarred entity) had transferred the funds (indirectly) to Korp, which facilitated the trades of Beejay by trading in the account of DDM & DDT. Therefore, acted in a manner highly detrimental to the interests of the securities market. Further, in light of above discussed interpretation of Regulation 3 and 4 of PFUTP Regulations and applying the ratio of Ketan Parekh vs. SEBI, it is well understood that the Noticee (Korp) by facilitating the trades of the debarred entities, has acted detrimental to the interests of the securities market within the meaning of Regulation 3 and 4 of PFUTP Regulations and has thus violated the same.  6. As stated above, on the basis of the report of the DA a show cause notice dated December 02, 2019 (\\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) enclosing therewith the Enquiry Report of the DA, was issued to the Noticee calling upon to show cause as to why action as recommended by the DA or any_____________________________________________________________________________________  Order in respect of Korp Securities Limited in the matter of Beejay Investment & Financial Consultants Private Ltd. Page 10 of 35   other direction/measure as may be deemed fit under Regulation 28(1) of the Intermediaries Regulations, should not be issued/imposed on it.  7. In compliance with the Regulation 28(2) of the Intermediaries Regulations, an opportunity of personal hearing was also granted to the Noticee on September 30, 2020. On the said date of hearing, the authorised representative of the Noticee appeared before me and made various submissions. Further, vide its email dated October 09, 2020, the Noticee has made various submissions in response to the SCN dated December 02, 2019 which are summarised hereunder:  i. The Noticee was not aware about the trades or dealings of Beejay with other entities, as alleged in the SCN/Enquiry Report and based on the material, it cannot be alleged that the Noticee was aware that DDT and DDM were carrying trades for Beejay.   ii. Vide application dated April 07, 2018, it has applied for surrender of membership of the NSEIL & and vide application dated April 23, 2018, to the BSE also. The said applications were filed even before issuance of SCN by the DA. The NSEIL has vide circular dated February 20, 2019, approved surrender of membership and the approval from the BSE for surrender of the membership is awaited. Copy of the said circular issued by the NSEIL has been filed in support.  iii. No cognizance of the fact was taken by DA that the Noticee had applied for voluntary surrender of the membership even before the SCN was issued to it since April, 2018 and that the Noticee has shut down its stock-broking business iv. Based on the information available in public domain, it is noted that the allegations against the alleged debarred entities as well the entities who allegedly traded on behalf of such debarred entities are still pending and final determination of the charges is yet awaited. Under the circumstances, disposing the present proceedings by holding it guilty of the alleged violation would not be pre-mature, but also not lawfully proper. It is submitted that in case the debarred entities and/or the trading entities are not held guilty, there would not be any case of violation against the Noticee._____________________________________________________________________________________  Order in respect of Korp Securities Limited in the matter of Beejay Investment & Financial Consultants Private Ltd. Page 11 of 35   v. The Enquiry Report has been submitted without dealing with the issue of non-supply of documents like copy of investigation report, internal notings, documents in support of alleging relationship between the Noticee and DDM/DDT, details of traders executed by DDM, DDT through other stock brokers etc. The same is in gross violation of principles of natural justice.  vi. Further, the DA, in the Enquiry Report, has relied upon various documents like letter dated July 03, 2015 of DDM, copy of bank account statement of Beeajay (A/c No. 627705044687 of ICICI Bank), letters dated May 26, 2015 of DDM and DDT, all of which were not provided to the Noticee. Also, certain details/information like details of profit made by Beejay & Eversight, profit & loss of DDM, DDT & Neelanchal etc., were also not furnished to the Noticee nor the same were part of the SCN. No opportunity to rebut the adverse inference drawn on the aforesaid evidence was provided to the Noticee by the DA, which has also led to violation of principles of natural justice. The Noticee has referred to and relied upon the following judgements of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India and also of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSAT\\\\\\\\u201d), to contend that all materials collected during investigation ought to have been provided to the Noticee:  a) Price Waterhouse Coopers vs SEBI in Civil Appeal no. 6003-6004 of 2012;  b) Union of India v. E. Bashyan, (1998) 2 SCC 196, etc  vii. It was submitted before the DA that only DDM and DDT are the clients of the Noticee and Neelanchal & other alleged debarred entities were not its clients. However, the DA has erroneously recorded even Neelanchal to be a client of the Noticee. viii. The SCN has alleged that the amount of INR 38 Lakh as received on September 02, 2011 from DDM were transferred to NSE Cash Market Settlement account of the Noticee on the same day. However, the SCN, at a separate place has alleged that DDM had traded through the Noticee on BSE on September 02, 2011. There is no allegation in the SCN that DDM had traded on NSE through the Noticee on September 02, 2011. The DA, without bringing any material on record, has given a finding that: \\\\\\\\u201cfrom the trade details of DDM provided by NSE, it was observed that DDM had traded on Sep 02.2011 through Korp.\\\\\\\\u201d Neither_____________________________________________________________________________________  Order in respect of Korp Securities Limited in the matter of Beejay Investment & Financial Consultants Private Ltd. Page 12 of 35   such allegations of trades executed on NSE were made in the SCN nor any material to arrive at such a finding has been furnished to the Noticee. Further, on September 02, 2011, DDM had executed various trades on NSE but there was no pay-in obligation of DDM and infact the Noticee had an obligation of INR 9.36 Lakh towards DDM for its trades.   ix. The Noticee had executed trades on behalf of other clients on the said day and had an outstanding balance with the NSEIL for such trades. In order to clear that balance, the Noticee had taken a short-term loan from various entities including Beejay, DDM & DDT and there is no embargo on a stock broker for taking any such loans.  x. The DA has also recorded a finding that on October 11, 2011, Beejay had transferred INR 40 Lakh to DDT and DDT had transferred INR 15 Lakh to the Noticee and further DDT had traded through the Noticee on October 12, 2011 on the BSE. The said finding is perverse and erroneous as on October 12, 2011, DDT had sold 185 shares of Neha International and there was no pay-in obligations by DDT. The Enquiry Report draws erroneous inferences based on receipt of INR 15 Lakh by the Noticee on October 11, 2011, as loan from DDT and no consideration was paid to the explanation that the said amount was received in the general business account of the Noticee.  xi. The SCN has alleged that the Noticee is connected to DDT and DDM which had facilitated the trades of the debarred entities by trading through the Noticee, however, in deviation to the said allegations, the Enquiry Report has recorded that: \\\\\\\\u201cit can be inferred that Beejay had transferred the funds (indirectly) to Korp, which facilitated the trades of Beejay by trading in the account of DDM & DDT.\\\\\\\\u2019  xii. In view of the said deviation and contradiction from the original allegations, the Noticee is not able to defend its case efficiently and such a deviation is not permissible in law. Various courts have laid down that the SCN needs to be clear as vague allegations affect the rights of the delinquent to defend the case effectively. Reliance has been placed on the judgment passed in the matter of Food Corporation of India vs. State of Punjab and others, (2001) 1 SCC 291; Canara Bank vs. Debasis Das, (2003) 4 SCC 557; New Samundri Transport Co. (P) Ltd vs. State of Punjab & Others 1976 AIR 57 etc._____________________________________________________________________________________  Order in respect of Korp Securities Limited in the matter of Beejay Investment & Financial Consultants Private Ltd. Page 13 of 35   xiii. During the relevant period of 2009-2012, the Noticee was having more than 244 clients with total annual turnover in the range of INR 5826 Crore to 12000 Crore. The alleged trades of DDT and DDM were miniscule as compared to the total turnover of the Noticee.  xiv. The traded turnover of DDM and DDT with the Noticee for the period of 2009 to 2014 was running into hundreds of crores.  xv. As a stock-broker, the Noticee did not enquire from its clients about their respective source of funds used for trading. There is nothing on record to show that the Noticee was aware about the receipt of funds by DDT and DDM from Beejay.  xvi. A stock-broker cannot be held liable for the transactions of its clients, unless it is established that the stock-broker was aware of the intentions of the clients, as held by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Kasat Securities Pvt. Ltd vs. SEBI.  xvii. The Noticee has also executed certain trades in its proprietary account. All the transactions in securities market executed on behalf of the clients as well as in the proprietary account of the Noticee were genuine and bonafide.  xviii. During the relevant time, the Noticee used to raise short term loan from various entities in its normal course of business. Such loans were received in the bank accounts of the Noticee and utilised for trading in securities market in the ordinary course. No share purchased by the Noticee during the relevant time was transferred to any of the debarred entities in any manner.  xix. The only obligation on a stock broker is to ensure that the funds are received by it through proper banking channel and from the bank account of the client, which the Noticee had fully ensured.  xx. The DA has not appreciated that the Noticee had received funds from the respective bank accounts of DDT and DDM, which were mapped as per the KYC records. The said funds were received for the purposes of purchase of securities for the said two entities and such securities were transferred to the respective Demat accounts of DDT and DDM. After sale of securities, the pay-outs were transferred to the bank accounts of DDT and DDM._____________________________________________________________________________________  Order in respect of Korp Securities Limited in the matter of Beejay Investment & Financial Consultants Private Ltd. Page 14 of 35   xxi. There is no allegation of the Noticee having received any funds/securities from the bank accounts/Demat accounts of Beejay nor any allegation of transfer of securities to the account of Beejay.  xxii. Nothing has been brought on record so as to substantiate that the Noticee was involved in fund transfers by Beejay to DDM/DDT or the said fund transfers were done on the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s instructions.  xxiii. The Noticee did not share email id with DDM and/or DDT. As per MCA database, the email id of the Noticee is korpsec@yahoo.co.in and the email id of DDM is ddm29021996@gmail.com while the email id of DDT is ddt01031996@gmail.com. The finding recorded in the Enquiry Report that the Form 23AC (Form for filing Balance sheet) dated August 31, 2011 filed by DDM, mentions e-mail id of DDM as korpsec@yahoo.co.in is erroneous and there was no evidence to support the allegation made in the SCN as the Form 23 AC was neither part of the SCN nor copy of the same was provided to the Noticee.  xxiv. The finding of the Enquiry Report that: \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticee seems to now present revised records and not as they were existing during 2009 to 20012\\\\\\\\u201d are erroneous as the Noticee cannot make any filing on behalf of third parties viz., DDT and DDM and there was no change in the email id of the Noticee. Only such third party could explain as to how the email id of the Noticee was mentioned in their records  xxv. Only because of the fact that Mr. Rajesh Kumar Agarwal (brother of Mr. Sushil Kumar Agarwal, Director of the Noticee) was a director of DDM and DDT, no adverse inference can be drawn against the Noticee or relationship with the said entities can be established. Both the brothers, their families and the companies are financially independent. xxvi. Mr. Anuj Agarwal was not a Director of the Noticee during the investigation period nor was he associated with the Noticee in any manner whatsoever during the investigation period. There is no dispute to the fact that Anuj Realtor Pvt. Ltd. and the Noticee are having common address, however, both the companies are financially independent. No adverse inference can be drawn against the Noticee only based on the shareholding of Mr. Anuj Agarwal or some of those entities, where he is a Director._____________________________________________________________________________________  Order in respect of Korp Securities Limited in the matter of Beejay Investment & Financial Consultants Private Ltd. Page 15 of 35   xxvii. Further, with regard to the statement made by Mr. Anuj Agarwal before Income Tax Department, the Enquiry Report has not appreciated the submission that such statement was made under threat and coercion as stated in an affidavit dated March 31, 2015 of Mr. Anuj Agarwal. It is well settled that admission by any person cannot be said to be conclusive and the person making such admission can show that it was incorrect.  xxviii. The DA has misinterpreted the submission made with respect to resignation of Mr. Sushil Kumar Agarwal and Mr. Rohit Mehta from the Board of the Noticee. The finding that the both of the aforesaid Directors had resigned after SEBI initiated the investigation is baseless as the initiation of investigation was neither in the knowledge of the Noticee nor the date of initiation was mentioned in the SCN issued by the DA.  xxix. In order to prove the serious charges of the PFUTP Regulations, cogent evidence is required to be placed on record. Reliance in this connection has been placed on the orders of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the mater of Smitaben N. Shah vs. SEBI (date of decision July 30, 2010); Mr. Babubhai Desai vs SEBI (date of decision February 15, 2016); H.B. Stockholdings Limited vs SEBI (date of decision: August 27, 2013)  xxx. The Noticee was not aware of the transactions executed between Beejay & DDM and the DA has not provided the copy of party ledger of Beejay provided by DDM during the investigation, to the Noticee.  xxxi. As recorded in the Enquiry Report, DDM, after receiving the funds from Beejay had utilized the same for various purposes. The huge difference in the total amount received from Beejay and the amounts transferred to the Noticee demolishes the allegations made in the SCN.  xxxii. On August 12, 2011, DDT had purchased 1,50,000 Equity Shares of KGL @ Rs.9.52, and for pay-in obligation of the said purchase, an amount of INR 14.30 Lakh (approx.) were received by the Noticee on August 18, 2011 towards pay-in obligation for the said transaction. The said trades were executed on the instructions of DDT and the Noticee does not have any mechanism to track the source of such funds. Further, Beejay had transferred INR 17.50 Lakh to DDT, and DDT had paid only INR 14.30 Lakh to the Noticee towards the aforesaid pay-in obligation._____________________________________________________________________________________  Order in respect of Korp Securities Limited in the matter of Beejay Investment & Financial Consultants Private Ltd. Page 16 of 35   xxxiii. Similarly, an amount of INR 45 Lakh was received on August 26, 2011, as loan from DDM and the said amount was received in the general business account of the Noticee. The said amount was not towards any purchase of securities made by DDM.  xxxiv. Only due to the fact that the aforesaid loans were raised without execution of any document, no adverse inference should be drawn. There is no prohibition under the securities law for taking loans in such manner. Further, the \\\\\\\\u2018confirmation of accounts\\\\\\\\u2019 from DDM, DDT and other entities have not been considered by the DA.  xxxv. DDM had funds transfers with the debarred entities even before the investigation period for which no allegation has been made by SEBI.  xxxvi. The Enquiry Report has recorded an adverse inference that the Noticee has not furnished any exchange data for the aforesaid transactions. However, the said data was never sought by the DA and the same is being filed in the present procee", "Date": "2021-04-30", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Order in respect of Korp Securities Limited in the matter of Beejay Investment & Financial Consultants Private Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/apr-2021/order-in-respect-of-korp-securities-limited-in-the-matter-of-beejay-investment-and-financial-consultants-private-limited_50014.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 62347, "unique_record_id": "6ef6294a94SEBI20210430", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6681e11f7858910306472c62", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 22:49:28", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "INR 2.91 Crore", "gpt_audience": "1.

No.  Name of the Entity  PAN  1  M/s Profit Guruji and its proprietor Shri. Pradeep Chaudhary alias Shri Pradeep Kumar Ola ABYP06213C    In the matter of Profit Guruji      1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) received a complaint, vide email dated July 15, 2020, wherein, the complainant inter alia alleged that;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 2 of 26    1.1. Mr. Pradeep Chaudhary, sole proprietor of M/s Profit Guruji is providing stock market advisory services. Complainant has mentioned that he has not entered into any written agreement with the M/s Profit Guruji or its proprietor Mr. Pradeep Chaudhary  1.2. The complaint got to know of Shri Pradeep Chaudhary through the YouTube Channel, providing level of nifty, bank nifty and other stock and investment services. Shri Pradeep Chaudhary on December 21, 2019, forwarded a screenshot to the complainant containing Mark To Market (MTM) profit of Rs. 6725/- on bank nifty option and assured to give profit of this kind every day. Shri Pradeep Chaudhary added the complainant in the WhatsApp group on March 18, 2020, and lured him for availing the services.  1.3. Complainant has mentioned that, as per the advice of Mr. Pradeep Chaudhary, he opened trading and demat account with Astha Credit & Securities Pvt. Ltd. (herein after referred as \\\\\\\\u2018Astha\\\\\\\\u2019) for trading.

During initial  period from April 7-27, 2020, Mr. Pradeep Chaudhary\\\\\\\\u2019s services did  make some profit, however, after April 28, 2020, the trades on various dates resulted in losses to the tune of Rs.3,35,000/-. The complainant has alleged that this loss in his trading was due to Mr. Pradeep Chaudhary\\\\\\\\u2019s carelessness, trading calls of large quantity without stop loss.   1.4. To substantiate his claim, complainant provided YouTube videos, Telegram Message, WhatsApp messages, call recordings and bank account details of M/s Profit Guruji. Complainant also stated that M/s Profit Guruji is active on YouTube__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 3 of 26  and Telegram channel. The following bank account details were provided by the complainant with respect to M/s Profit Guruji: Bank Account name Account number Branch  State Bank of India (SBI) Pradeep Kumar Ola 34855952080 Jaipur    1.5.

SEBI conducted an examination in relation to the affairs of M/s Profit Guruji to ascertain possible violation, if any, of the provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and rules and regulations made thereunder.   3. It was observed that the complainant has referred the proprietor of M/s Profit Guruji as Shri Pradeep Chaudhary. However from the SBI Bank account details provided by the complainant of M/s Profit Guruji and the Know Your Client (KYC), bank statements and Account Opening Form (AOF) obtained from SBI Bank, it was observed that the bank account No. 34855952080, is in the name of Shri. Pradeep Kumar Ola.   4. In order to ascertain whether Shri Pradeep Chaudhary and Shri Pradeep Kumar Ola,   are the same person a google search on the contact numbers provided by the complainant i.e. 9588229481, 7221901473 and 9649144111, was made. It was observed that search query with the phone number 9588229481 resulted in showing the search result of the YouTube and Telegram channel, in the name of Shri Pradeep Chaudhary with contact email id as er.pcola@gmail.com and__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 4 of 26  poojaimportexport@gmail.com. Google search with the query on mobile no.  9649144111, resulted in the pdf file of \\\\\\\\u2018Pooja Import Exports\\\\\\\\u2019 on indiamart platform and olla battery page. The details on the resultant pages were in the name of Shri Pradeep Kumar Ola with contact email id er.pcola@gmail.com and contact no 9649144111, located at Plot No. 8-9 Anand Enclave Harsuliya, Jaipur, Rajasthan. Further, it was noted that the email id in the SBI bank statement of Shri Pradeep Kumar Ola is also er.pcola@gmail.com. Further reference of Pooja Import Export appeared common in both google search. Therefore, since in all the places the email id and a common reference, it is prime facie observed that Shri Pradeep Chaudhary and Shri Pradeep Kumar Ola are same person and the name is being interchangeably used.  5. As per the registered intermediary database on SEBI website, it is observed that neither M/s Profit Guruji nor its proprietor Shri. Pradeep Chaudhary alias Shri Pradeep Kumar Ola (hereinafter referred as \\\\\\\\u2018Shri Pradeep\\\\\\\\u2019) (collectively referred to as noticees) are registered with SEBI in any capacity.   6. Domain registration was checked on www.whois.com database, to check if there is any website registered in the noticees name, however, no information was obtained.  Shri. Pradeep is active through his YouTube and Telegram channel in the name of Profit Guruji. On perusal of the YouTube channel, it was observed that the entity is giving price target and making buy and sell recommendations in Bank nifty and various stocks.  7.

SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s preliminary examination based on the YouTube and Telegram channel and the WhatsApp chat screenshots provided by the complainant, it was observed that M/s Profit Guruji is__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 5 of 26  acting as an Investment Adviser for providing tips and trading calls in securities market without obtaining a registration under SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d).    CONSIDERATION & PRIMA FACIE FINDINGS    8. I have perused the material available on record, such as, information available on the YouTube and Telegram channel, WhatsApp chat provided by the complainant and the information obtained from SBI Bank.

Issue No. 1:  Whether M/s Profit Guruji is holding itself out and/or acting as investment adviser?__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 6 of 26  9. As regards the first issue, I note the following from the material available on record:    10. With respect to the Telegram channel, it is observed to be created around July 25, 2019. The messages posters and screenshots of Telegram shows that the entity is making statements of assured return, no loss, doubling of money, etc. such as; 10.1. Telegram post dated July 26, 2020 \\\\\\\\u201cno loss daily kamao (earn) Intrady strategy - Earn 4000/day\\\\\\\\u201d  10.2.

It is observed that through Telegram channel M/s Profit Guruji is providing investment instruction, tips and advises and giving assurance of monthly and daily return on the trades.  12. Further no disclaimer has been observed from the telegram messages furnished by the complainant. The Telegram channel is active till date.  13. On perusal of the YouTube channel of M/s Profit Guruji, it is observed that YouTube channel is active till date. It is observed that M/s Profit Guruji has uploaded various videos on YouTube channel giving buy, sell recommendations on specific stocks/indices.  14. Upon perusal of the information obtained from the YouTube channel, it is observed that there are around 732 videos. Amongst the videos, two sample videos posted on__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 7 of 26  YouTube on February 17, 2021 were checked, which has the below mentioned caption: Yeh level tuta tho bhayankar toofan and Kal se yeh share karege paison ki baarish  15. Extracts of a few other tips/recommendations included in the YouTube videos are placed below reference:   15.1. YouTube post on July 26, 2020, with the caption \\\\\\\\u201cno loss intraday trading strategy || only profit intraday strategy || intraday tips\\\\\\\\u201d  15.2. YouTube post on August 20, 2020 with the caption \\\\\\\\u201cYe 35 ka share dega 1000% ka profit, target Rs.350\\\\\\\\u201d  15.3. You tube post on August 24, 2020 with the caption \\\\\\\\u201c yeh share daudne wala hai. Paisa double ho jaayega\\\\\\\\u201d   16. Further various advertisements have been made on the YouTube channel providing the contact no 9588229481 for contacting where the caption of the advertisements are as follows: 16.1.No Loss >Daily Kamao > Intraday Strategy > Earn 4000/- Day 16.2.Intraday Trading > Profit : 8000 > Profit Guruji 16.3.I give Formula Earn Monthly 10-15% > Call 9588229481 16.4.Live Trade Trade > 9588229481 > Profit 3390/- > Capital Used 3700/-__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 8 of 26   17. It is observed that the entity provides disclaimer in the beginning of his videos on YouTube. It was observed that such disclaimer is shown only for few milliseconds. Extract of disclaimer provided on the YouTube channel is as below: \\\\\\\\u201cDo not take a position unless you are prepared to sustain a TOTAL LOSS. Your loss could include the money you invested as well as commission and transaction charges\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.  \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..YOU SHOULD NOT MAKE ANY DECISIONS, FINANCIAL, INVESTMENTS, TRADING OR OTHERWISE, BASED ON ANY OF THE INFORMATION PRESENTED WITHOUT UNDERTAKING INDEPENDENT DUE-DELIGENCE AND CONSULATION WITH A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL.  You understand that you are using this information AT YOUR OWN RISK\\\\\\\\u201d.  18. From above, it is observed that the entity has put out some sort of disclaimer on market risk, to consult a professional or make due diligence before making investments. It is observed that such disclosures are shown only for a few milliseconds at the beginning of the video. As the disclaimer is available only for few milliseconds, it is not possible for anybody to read/understand even a sentence of the disclaimer.   19. Though there is some sought of disclaimer given in the videos, however it is known fact that investments in the securities market are subject to market risk and no guarantee and assurance of any kind is possible. Therefore, by giving these assurances or even so by making such representations in the videos and messages, M/s Profit Guruji has actively concealed the fact of guarantee of any sought of return is not possible in the securities market to lure the gullible public to invest their money.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 9 of 26  20. Since no assurance or guarantee of any sought of return or profit is possible in the securities market, therefore by making such claims and presentations knowing that the same is not true, realistic and correct, is grossly misleading  the public.   21. Further even though the disclaimer is provided, in any event the same cannot be considered as defense where completely contradictory and misleading claim of no loss/assured return/target return in absolute amount, percentage return, daily and monthly return, no loss, only profit, etc. is given in the post and messages, concealing the facts.  22. It is observed that, M/s Profit Guruji while making advertisement through YouTube Channel is providing contact no. 9588229481 and/or asking to WhatsApp directly to get in touch for services of any investment and trade related activities.  23. It is observed from the screenshots of WhatsApp chat shared by complainant, that the M/s Profit Guruji is engaged in investment advisory services with the following service charges with linked assured monthly profit:  S.No. Monthly profit (in Rs.) Service Charge (in Rs.) 1 20000-25000 3500/per month 2 70000-75000 16500/per month 3 100000-110000 24000/per month 4 145000-155000 42500/per month 5 190000-2lakh 42500/per month   24. It is important to note that no such structure of service charge could be found on public domain i.e. YouTube and Telegram channel. Hence, it is observed that such__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 10 of 26  service charge messages may be forwarded through WhatsApp exclusively to the clients, to whom entity is providing advices.  25. From the above table, it is noted that service fees charged by noticees varies based on the monthly profit guaranteed. The service charges range from Rs.3,500/- to Rs.42,500/- with monthly profit between Rs.20,000/- to Rs.2,00,000/-.   26. From examination of the AOF, KYC and bank statements details, the following was observed,  26.1. The saving account was opened in the name of Shri Pradeep Kumar Ola on March 24, 2015, with occupation type mentioned is \\\\\\\\u201cothers\\\\\\\\u201d with monthly income of Rs.20,001/- to Rs.50,000/-. Further details observed are as follows:  S.No. Details Particulars 1 Account Name Shri Pradeep Kumar Ola 2 Bank Name/Payment Gateway State Bank of India 3 Account Number 34855952080 4 IFSC Code  SBIN0012823 5 Branch Code 12823 6 Date of Account Opening 08/04/2015  7 Bank Statement Period 08/04/2015 to 19/03/2021 8 Date of last Credit 19/3/2021  9 Total Credit since 08/04/2015 to 19/03/2021 Rs. 1,52,05,057.46 10 Credit in bank account from 17/03/2018* to 19/03/2021 Rs. 1,41,36,318.00  *Date of Creation of the YouTube Channel__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 11 of 26   26.2. From the bank statement analysis and the narration, it is observed that there are various entries of trading and transfer of funds to Zerodha and Astha Credit (registered stock broker with SEBI namely, Zerodha Broking Ltd and Astha Credit & Securities Pvt. Ltd., respectively. These entries indicate that Shri Pradeep is actively involved in securities market trading/investment.   26.3. It is observed that the major credits in the bank account only happened after the YouTube channel creation date i.e. March 17, 2018. However, details on various credit entries (except for where Zerodha and Astha is mentioned) in the bank statement, in terms of counter parties could not be ascertained though the narrations are available.  26. I observe that, M/s Profit Guruji is promoting its various service packages ranging between Rs 3,500/- to Rs 42,500/- monthly fee and the same is being offered in securities market through WhatAapp mode to the clients/investors. It is also observed that these plans / packages are coupled with monthly assured return ranging between Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 200,000/-. Further the telegram content indicating \\\\\\\\u201cI give formula earn monthly 10-15%, call: 9588229481\\\\\\\\u201d and other content of assured earnings/ Target return and profits (few captions mentioned in paragraph 17 above) and also providing contact details, shows that the formula, strategy and tips of relevant investment advice may be given through Telegram channel also apart from WhatsApp mode. Thus, it is observed, that M/s Profit Guruji is holding itself out as an Investment Adviser. In view of the above facts and circumstances, and the content of Telegram and the WhatsApp, coupled with the service charges and the monthly profit assured, prima facie, it is inferred that M/s Profit Guruji is carrying out services related to investments in securities market.  27. In this regard, I have perused the definition of investment Adviser as given in regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, which states that investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 12 of 26  person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment Adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have also perused the Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines investment advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d    28. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is, prima facie noted, from the activity of the M/s Profit Guruji that it is holding itself out as Investment Adviser by offering to provide services related to investing, purchasing and selling in securities market and is also offering various packages relating to investment advisory for subscription/fees and these services fall within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advice\\\\\\\\u201d under Regulation 2(l) and Investment Adviser as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations. Therefore, M/s Profit Guruji  is not only holding itself out as Investment Adviser but has also acting as an Investment Adviser for consideration.   Issue No 2:  If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether M/s Profit Guruji have, prima facie, violated any provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) read with SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (\\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) and the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (\\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d)?   29. In order to ensure that investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, states that  \\\\\\\\u201cNo  stock  broker,  sub -broker,  share  transfer  agent,  banker  to  an  issue,  trustee  of  trust deed,  registrar  to  an  issue,  merchant  banker,  underwriter,  portfolio  manager,__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 13 of 26  investment Adviser  and  such  other  intermediary  who  may  be  associated  with  securities  market  shall  buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration  obtained  from  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the regulations  made under  this Act\\\\\\\\u201d    30. Further, Regulation 3(1) of the IA regulations, states that \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment Adviser or hold itself out as an investment Adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.     31. Thus, as per Section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Regulation 3(1) of IA Regulations, any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI regulations, i.e. the registration of the investment Advisers is mandatory.     32. The activities of M/s Profit Guruji, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions shows that, the M/s Profit Guruji, is holding itself out as Investment Adviser and is acting as Investment Adviser. However, no material was available on record to indicate that M/s Profit Guruji or its proprietor Shri Pradeep, had a certificate of registration as an Investment Adviser. In this context, it is noted that M/s Profit Guruji or its proprietor Shri Pradeep, are not registered with SEBI in any capacity. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by M/s Profit Guruji, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, leads to the conclusion that the M/s Profit Guruji is holding itself out and acting as Investment Adviser without a certificate of registration from SEBI. In my view, these activities/representations of M/s Profit Guruji are, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, read with regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.   33. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and Regulations__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 14 of 26  4(1), 4(2)(k), 4(2)(r) and 4(2)(s) of the PFUTP Regulations. The text of the aforesaid provisions is reproduced below:  SEBI Act Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control Section 12A: No person shall directly or indirectly:  (a) use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  (b) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange; (c) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  PFUTP Regulations Regulation 3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities No person shall directly or indirectly- (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 15 of 26  (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.  4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a manipulative, fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities market. (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a manipulative fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves any of the following: - (r) [knowingly] planting false or misleading news which may induce sale or purchase of securities (k) disseminating information or advice through any media, whether physical or digital, which the disseminator knows to be false or misleading and which is designed or likely to influence the decision of investors dealing in securities\\\\\\\\u201d. (s) mis-selling of securities or services relating to securities market; Explanation- For the purpose of this clause, \"mis-selling\" means sale of securities or services relating to securities market by any person, directly or indirectly, by\\\\\\\\u2500  (i)knowingly making a false or misleading statement, or  (ii)knowingly concealing or omitting material facts, or  (iii)knowingly concealing the associated risk, or  (iv)not taking reasonable care to ensure suitability of the securities or service to the buyer}];  34. In my view, an unregistered investment adviser like M/s Profit Guruji, can put investors at great risk by misleading them. Without having a registered Investment__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 16 of 26  Adviser certificate, M/s Profit Guruji is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients with the objective of making money/collecting fees through various services and packages. Further, M/s Profit Guruji has put information in public domain and advertising using YouTube channel, about investment in securities market and providing services and advices through Telegram channel and WhatsApp mode and also offering services on subscription model for assured monthly return/target. It is also prima facie observed that various plans / packages being offered by M/s Profit Guruji ranges between Rs. 3,500/- to RS. 42,500/- monthly fees with assured monthly return from Rs.20,000 to Rs.200,000/-  35. Thus, by making the aforesaid claims of assured \\\\\\\\u201cmonthly return\\\\\\\\u201d, between Rs.20,000 to Rs.200,000/-, and other assurances such as no loss, only profit, daily target, etc.  M/s Profit Guruji is, prima facie, inducing investors to deal in securities by availing its services. It is observed that M/s Profit Guruji claims to provide assured and specific monthly return on client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment. This is, prima facie, an active concealment of the material fact that every investment in the market is subject to market risk. Considering the dynamics of the market, the returns from the investment in the market are unpredictable, no matter how much and for how long the investment is made. This act of conveying specific monthly returns and other assurances is, prima facie, indulged for the purpose of luring customers in its net and thereby increasing its income. In light of the same, the act of M/s Profit Guruji to actively conceal material information and to suggest/assure return is a non-genuine and a deceptive act and has been, prima facie, made with an intent to influence the client to avail its advisory services.   36. Further even though some disclaimer is displayed before the videos, in any event the same cannot be considered as defense where completely contradictory and misleading claim of no loss/assured return/target return and also in absolute amount, is given in the post and messages. It may be noted that, securities market is subject to market risk and a particular return, or for that matter, any form of return on an__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s Profit Guruji                                                                             Page 17 of 26  investment cannot be guaranteed or assured, no matter how long the period for which the investment is held or advice on that investment is offered to the client. I note that the M/s Profit Guruji, is well aware of the market and has admitted of this fact through some kind of disclaimer, however despite this, M/s Profit Guruji has concealed the fact that no guarantee and assurance of any kind is possible in the securities market and even so with this knowledge M/s Profit Guruji has provided such an assurance/Target Return in the post/messages, misleading the public. Therefore, it is clear that M/s Profit Guruji, is making misrepresentation to the clients and also actively concealing the fact.   37. The above discussed omission and act of M/s Profit Guruji  are, prima facie, fraudulent and are covered under the definition of 'fraud' defined under regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations which reads as under:  38. \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d includes any act, expression, omission or concealment committed whether in a deceitful manner or not by a person or by any other person with his connivance or by his agent while dealing in securities in order to induce another person or his agent to deal in securities, whether or not there is any wrongful", "Date": "2021-04-30", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Interim Ex Parte Order in the matter of M/s.

During the personal hearing, the authorised representative reiterated the submissions made vide letter dated February 15, 2021, and requested for a lenient view.  7. I shall now proceed to examine the submissions made by the Noticees vis-\\\\\\\\xe0-vis the findings of the Interim Order.    Replies and Submissions of Noticees   8. The replies and submissions  dated February 15, 2021, are inter alia summarized below:   8.1. Internal policy of limited services is followed and services provided after KYC documents are received and risk profiling determined. Based on risk profile,Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited Page 7 of 20 suitable product is recommended to client. Clients are not allowed to subscribe to all services as it may or may not be suitable to them. 8.2. All clients are explained the scope of services and manner in which services will be provided. Although the word \"Target\" was mentioned, the intention was not to give any assurance or guarantee, hence, the words 'Not Guaranteed / Not Assured\" were mentioned along with the word \"Target\". Client was made aware of the same and has signed the documents. 8.3. In case of Mr. Yagnesh Rawal too, the same process was followed. Though he was insisted to not subscribe to the entire services but suitable services, yet he took more services. This is evident from the fact that he paid for the different services opted for. After deliberations with Mr. Yagnesh, he insisted that his family members be also on-boarded for subscribing to other services. The emails from each of them clearly states they were well aware of service for which the amount they paid. KYC procedure and Risk profile of all the family members was done and proper records are maintained for the same.  8.4. The invoices issued to the clients also mentioned the service tenure as some trading sessions or target amount whichever occurs earlier. Hence BRIA never had any intentions to promise or guarantee returns. There could be a possibility where the service would end as soon as the number of trading sessions as mentioned in the invoice would have completed. In such cases, the service will not continue till target is received. 8.5. We agree that every investment in the market is subject to market risk and any investment made by the client can also run into losses and even become zero. Hence the same has been communicated to clients via a document which is signed by the client and the same is received from the client via. email. 8.6. We have never attempted to induce the client to subscribe to our advisory service. In fact in case of Mr. Yagnesh and his family, Mr. Yagnesh himself insisted to let his family subscribe to our advisory services. 8.7. We have always acted honestly, fairly and in the best interests of our clients. All the terms and conditions of availing our advisory services are clearly mentioned to the clients and the same are accepted and signed by the client.Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited Page 8 of 20 The clients are at free will to upgrade the services based on the suitability of the service and are never forced or threatened to avail our other services. No such instance has ever been recorded at our end. We request you to kindly consider the same. 8.8. BRIA has provided investment advise only after the KYC and Risk profile of the Mr. Yagnesh and his family is done as required under the IA regulations. Even if BRIA has raised invoices for subscribed services and collected fees before doing the KYC, Risk Profiling and Suitability Assessment of the clients, investment advice is given only after the KYC and risk profiling is done. 8.9. As per regulations 16(a), 16(b)(ii) read with regulation 17(a) of IA Regulations, rendering of investment advice shall be done only after obtaining information from the client for carrying out his risk profiling, identifying whether client is unwilling or unable to accept the loss of capital for ensuring that investment advice provided is appropriate to the risk profile of the client. The same is followed by BRIA i.e. the investment advice is given only after KYC and risk profiling of the client is done. 8.10. The risk profile of the clients was determined based on the score of the answers provided by the family members. The same is agreed by the clients via emails. 8.11. Mr. Yagnesh insisted on subscription of the services by the family members. The family members were willing to take the risk associated with subscribing to our services and hence agreed to sign declaration related to suitability assessment of the services provided by us. Each of the members have signed the documents as well as send confirmation from their email ids only. 8.12. We always intended to do business in the rightful way. BRIA's team has never intended to make any of the clients suffer losses. Investments in securities markets are subject to market risk and the same has been mentioned in the documents, signed by the clients. We have always informed our clients that our calls may go wrong. We have never maintained or mentioned that all our calls will be accurate or profitable. 8.13. We are willing to share more details with SEBI, if required.Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited Page 9 of 20  Prayer made by noticees  8.14. As mentioned in the notice, a complaint was received against BRIA by SEBI. We wish to state that the Client did not approach us directly for the issue or complaint and directly contacted SEBI. We have never exploited any of the clients for money. In fact, we have clients who have continued to subscribe to the products and services and are happy with the services. We can share copies of testimonials of our clients, if required. 8.15. We have paid salaries to all the employees on time. We have paid income tax and other applicable taxes on time. The balance amounts are kept in the bank accounts as is and are not used for any wrongful purpose. We request SEBI to consider our proper working in the same as till date there has been no defaults from us in any manner.  8.16. We do not have any intentions to divert the fees received from our clients which are kept in the bank accounts.  8.17. The client had already filed complaint against us in year 2019, the response of which was submitted by us in SEBI Indore office. 8.18. On directions of SEBI's Indore office, the Vijaynagar, Indore, police on December 16, 2020 raided our office in an improper manner and detained our office executive. They also seized and closed our entire office. We are not sure if they are even permitted by SEBI to take such harsh action. This defamed the name of our company in a very adverse manner. A lawsuit has been filed against us which is pending under the Hon'ble Court of India. We were treated in the similar way every unregistered company in the Indore city is treated. This has harmed even the families of the directors mentally and financially. We are facing a double wrath for this only complaint against us from both ends. SEBI is requested to kindly consider the same and provide us any relief. 8.19. Since the start of our working, we have received a total of only 10 genuine complaints of which 9 were duly resolved by us even before the time limit givenOrder in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited Page 10 of 20 to us. The 1 pending is by Mr. Rawal only. This shows our excellent working and satisfactory client base to which we would like to request SEBI to provide their kind consideration too. Less than 1% of dissatisfaction can arise in any industry and any business. Our proper working is really outshined by this in a city where other companies have a huge number of similar complaints. We request SEBI to please be kind in considering this fact too. 8.20. The order against us has put all our existing clients in a mid-situation as we are unable to deliver the services from our end. We are generously interested to carry on our work in even better manner in the coming future and request SEBI to provide us the opportunity for the same.  Relief requested by Noticees  8.21. Request SEBI to at least give directions to ICICI Bank LTD. and HDFC Bank LTD. to unfreeze the bank account of the Company to pay salaries of employees who are dependent on BRIA for their living. 8.22. SEBI to kindly give directions to unfreeze our demat accounts of the individual directors to take care of family and provide a financial aid.  Consideration of Issues:    9. I have considered the oral and written submissions made by the Noticees. The issue to be considered at this stage is as follows:   Whether in light of the facts and circumstances of the case, the findings of the interim order and the submissions of the Noticees in response thereto, the directions issued against the Noticees vide the interim order need to be confirmed, revoked or modified in any manner?     10. The consideration of the issues in light of the written submissions made by the Noticees is contained in subsequent paragraphs.Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited Page 11 of 20  10.1. The noticees have contended that although the word \"Target\" was mentioned, the intention was not to give any assurance or guarantee about the same. The client was made aware of the same and that the client has signed the documents. The Noticee has contended that it does not give Guarantee / Assurance of any \\\\\\\\u201cTarget\\\\\\\\u201d to its investors; instead it is committing to its clients that it will continue to provide investment advisory services to its clients till such time that the \\\\\\\\u201ctrading session\\\\\\\\u201d or the \\\\\\\\u201ctarget\\\\\\\\u201d is achieved. Further the document on market risk of investment loss has been communicated to clients which is signed and sent back by the client.   10.2. I note that the Noticee is assuring the client that if he/she continues to act on the investment advice given by the Noticee, he/she will achieve a certain quantifiable return, at some time or the other. In my view this constitutes as assurance of the Target return. This aspect is further strengthened by the observation that, on the invoice \\\\\\\\u201cTarget\\\\\\\\u201d return has been clearly quantified in terms of absolute amount, for example, Rs.26,00,000/- within a service tenure of trading session 249-899, with a proposed investment of less than 1 Lac and service fee of Rs 92,311.50. The intent of the Noticee in representing to the clients that the payment received is for delivery of a target \\\\\\\\u201cX\\\\\\\\u201d amount within a service tenure, is clear from the same. It is a known fact that all investments in the securities market are subject to market risk and a particular return, or for that matter, any form of return on an investment cannot be guaranteed or assured, no matter how long the period for which the investment is held or advice on that investment is offered to the client. I note that the Noticee, being a registered SEBI intermediary, having obtained the necessary certifications, is well aware of this and has also admitted this fact and despite this knowledge, has provided such an assurance to its clients.Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited Page 12 of 20 10.3. Noticees have admitted to the securities market risk and that investment made in the securities market can run into losses or even become zero. Hence, the words 'Not Guaranteed / Not Assured\" were mentioned along with the word \"Target\". Further the noticees have also contended there could be a possibility where the service would end as soon as the number of trading sessions have completed without target achieved.  I find that the Noticees, through the use of this words \\\\\\\\u201ctarget\\\\\\\\u201d return, is committing to the client that he/she will achieve the \\\\\\\\u201ctarget\\\\\\\\u201d mentioned in the invoice by acting on the investment advice provided. I find that the commitment of the Noticee to the client that the service offered will continue till the \\\\\\\\u201ctarget\\\\\\\\u201d is achieved, tantamount to offering an assured/guaranteed return and is grossly misleading, and an active concealment of the fact that any return on an investment cannot be guaranteed as all investments in the securities market are subject to market risk. There may be a scenario where the capital deployed by the investor gets eroded as the investment advice provided by the Noticee turns out to be incorrect due to market risk. In such scenario, it does not matter if the Noticee has also provided stop loss figures as part of its advice, as the same will only limit the loss and not eliminate loss on the trade, and, in case of series of transactions a large part of the capital of the investor can also be lost, with no possibility of it being recovered with the meagre capital . I find that a mere statement in the invoices that the \\\\\\\\u201cTarget\\\\\\\\u201d return is \\\\\\\\u2018not guaranteed / not assured\\\\\\\\u2019, document on market risk nor the contention that the tenure of trading sessions could complete before the target being achieved, cannot dilute the conduct of the Noticee by concealing the fact the no guarantee or assurance is possible in the securities market and making false representations and giving assurances, that it can deliver the \\\\\\\\u201cTarget\\\\\\\\u201d return. The contention that it\\\\\\\\u2019s just a statement and may be not achievable by the clients as the trading session may end before the target achieved and investors may not achieve the target, these only makes the Noticees \\\\\\\\u201cstatement\\\\\\\\u201d even worse. If the Noticees know that the investments are subject to market risk, cannot make any representationOrder in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited Page 13 of 20 that, they can deliver a \\\\\\\\u201cTarget\\\\\\\\u201d return or to say that it can generate returns with any level of assurance irrespective of the tenure. Therefore, it is clear that Noticees are making assurances of the \\\\\\\\u201cTarget\\\\\\\\u201d which they know cannot be assured. The Noticees cannot escape liability for making such misrepresentation to the investor merely on the ground that the investor has consented to the service and was made aware that his investments are subject to market risks or that the trading session may also end before the target being achieved. Hence, I am of the view that the assurances of the Noticees to the investors are grossly misleading and concealment of the facts.    10.4. Noticees have contended that, even if BRIA has raised invoices for subscribed services and collected fees before doing the KYC, risk profiling and suitability assessment of the clients, investment advice is given only after the KYC, risk profiling and suitability assessment is done. I note here that the noticees have admitted that they have received the payment before KYC, risk profiling and suitability assessment of the clients, however, contended that the investment advice is given only after full risk profiling and suitability assessment of the client. However, no documentary evidence has been placed on record to substantiate this contention. It is also noted from the terms and conditions that the Noticees have no refund policy for the fees collected. As is admitted that payment for the services/product was made beforehand before the risk profile and suitability assessment, it may be possible that the product/services offered is non-commensurate with the risk tolerance and appetite of the client and unsuitable to the client. Further it is inconceivable on how for the product/services for which the payment has already been made without risk profiling may be suitable to clients, since the same is done afterwards. Since there is \\\\\\\\u201cno refund\\\\\\\\u201d policy after upfront receipt of fees, this in effect shows that the client is stuck with the product/service irrespective of what his subsequent risk profiling arrived at by the Company. Thus the contentions of the Noticees have no meaning.Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited Page 14 of 20  10.5. The Noticee has contended that it has not insisted that the clients make payment and take various different services/packages and the same was taken with free consent and full knowledge of the client, which is evident from the payment made and declaration of suitability assessment (suitability waivers) agreed by the clients. It is noted from the suitability assessment provided to the client that it contains that,\\\\\\\\u201cIt is clearly been communicated to you that high risk profile services may be more risky but you still has opted that\\\\\\\\u201d. I note here that the noticees have not provided any documentary evidence conveying or communicating or counselling the clients that the product/services chosen/offered are not appropriate and suitable based on the risk appetite of the clients. I also note here that, the test of suitable product/service by IA to any client cannot be tested based on \\\\\\\\u201cagreed to and paid\\\\\\\\u201d by the client just because the client has made the payment or even more so where the payment is made before the risk profiling is even done. It is also noted and has been brought out in the interim order that the consent of the clients has been taken in the nature of suitability waiver rather than as explicit consent from the clients. The same can be seen through the point in the suitability assessment, \\\\\\\\u201cto revert back in case of disconsent in 24 hrs else it will be assumed as accepted\\\\\\\\u201d. From the above facts, it is noted that the noticees have relied on waiver of suitability assessment of the clients, than the appropriateness of the services based on the risk appetite of the clients. Further to this, I note that the suitability assessment also contains that, \\\\\\\\u201cYou with your free consent & sound state of mind accept the services & willingly want to work upon our services despite of your age and risk profile\\\\\\\\u2019\\\\\\\\u2019. As from this declaration being taken, it is quite obvious that product/services availed/offered to the clients was not appropriate and also not commensurate with the risk profiling and suitability. It is important to note that conducting an objective assessment of the risk profile/ appetite of the clients as provided in the IA Regulations is incumbent on the Investment Adviser. For instance, Regulation 16(b) insists upon a process forOrder in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited Page 15 of 20 assessment of risk which the client is willing to take (subjective criteria) and able to take (objective criteria). I note that there may be cases where the client is willing to accept the risk of capital (subjective criteria), however, he/she may not have the capacity to absorb the loss (objective criteria). Further Regulation 17(e) of IA Regulations on suitability requirement, indicates that the recommendation has to be consistent with his/her \\\\\\\\u201ccapacity for absorbing loss\\\\\\\\u201d (objective criteria) and appropriate with the risk profile of the client as per Regulation 17(a), which can include the willingness to take risk (subjective criteria). However, such blanket suitability waivers as in this case, only nullifies the protection given to the investors by mandating the IA to follow the mix of mandatory criteria and subjective criteria for selection of suitable products. If the Noticees argument on receipt of payment and suitability assessment declaration were to be accepted, there would be no need for any IA to do any risk profiling and suitability assessment. They could simply take \\\\\\\\u201csuitability waiver\\\\\\\\u201d from clients and sell them any/all products no matter how unsuitable. Clearly, this is not the intent of the IA regulations and any such interpretation would render the regulations infructuous. Therefore the contention of the Noticees cannot be accepted.  10.6. The Noticees have contended that they have done risk profiling and suitability assessment and the same is determined based on the score of answers and sent to client via email. With respect to this contention, I note that the Noticees have not provided any documentary evidence demonstrating the suitability of the products/services being offered to the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 commensurate with the risk profiling and suitability assessment made of the clients, on the basis of the scores arrived. Further I note that, as the payment for the services/product offered was received beforehand therefore the risk profiling and suitability is post facto exercise and merely a formality, without due diligence and compliance of IA Regulations. I note here that, the objective of risk profiling and suitability assessment is toOrder in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited Page 16 of 20 determine the risk tolerance level of clients and recommend suitable asset allocation/investment commensurate with the risk tolerance level of clients, and if the same is not empirically made, it can lead to unsuitable and inappropriate services being offered to the clients, which defeats the objective of due diligence by the IA and is against the mandate of the IA Regulations. I also note from the interim order that, in response to the question in RPF \\\\\\\\u2018What is your experience in equity/Commodity /Forex\\\\\\\\u2019 markets, all the clients have responded that they had no experience in Equity, Commodity and Forex markets. Further, it is noted from the same RPF documents that the clients have responded to the question \\\\\\\\u2018Experience in Market Products\\\\\\\\u2019 as \\\\\\\\u2018Stock and/or Derivatives\\\\\\\\u2019. It shows that the responses recorded by BRIA are contradictory and demonstrates that BRIA has not done adequate due diligence in the process of risk profiling.  Therefore, in view of the above, also nothings at para 10.5 and the findings in the interim order, that the Noticees have not done the risk profiling and suitability of the clients appropriately and have on-boarded the clients to collect service fees as much as possible with as many services/packages as possible, with no regards to their risk profile/appetite, for their own benefit, disregarding the spirit of the IA Regulation mandate. I find that the Noticees have not done risk profiling and suitability of the clients appropriately.       11. In view of the above, I note that the submissions/contentions of the Noticee are devoid of merit and therefore cannot be accepted.   12.

In the interest of natural justice, an opportunity of hearing was provided to the Noticees on February 23, 2021 vide hearing notice dated February 04, 2021. The hearing notice was returned undelivered for the Noticees namely, Mr. Mahesh Saraf and Mrs. Sarita Saraf whereas the hearing opportunity was not availed by Mr. Anil Raika and Mrs. Ambika Raika.  In view of the same, another opportunity of hearing was provided to the Noticees on March 10, 2021 vide hearing notice dated March 02, 2021.

AR agreed to make additional submissions by April 09, 2021. Mr. Mahesh Saraf vide letter dated April 07, 2021 made the following additional submissions for himself and on behalf of other noticees:  \\\\\\\\u201cI am submitting this Reply on my behalf and on behalf of other noticees. At the outset, we wish to submit a brief background, which is as under:  1. The Noticees made a Public Announcement pursuant to and in compliance with Regulation 10 and 12 of SAST Regulations, 1997 on November 03, 2007 to acquire 10,00,120 Equity Shares representing 20 % of issued, subscribed, paid up (net of Shares forfeited) & voting Capital of Jatia Finance Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"JFL\"). JFL was later renamed as Starcom Information Technology Limited. A copy of the Public announcement as available on SEBI website is annexed hereto at Exhibit\" A\".  2. Prior to that the Noticees entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (hereinafter referred to as \"SPA\") on October 30, 2007 with Shri Mohanlal Jatia & Shri Sanjay Jatia (collectively referred to as \"Promoters/ Promoter group shareholders of JFL\") to acquire 34,99,980 Equity Shares representing 69.99% of shareholding of JFL.  3. The SPA necessitated the Open Offer in terms of Regulation 10 and 12 of SAST Regulations. Pursuant to the open offer, the noticees acquired a total of 72.31 % of the shareholding of JFL. The Noticees also filed the requisite report dated April 04, 2008 under SAST Regulations, 1997 with SEBI informing all the details of the said acquisition. A copy of the said report is available on SEBI website and is in public domain which is annexed hereto at Exhibit \"B\".  4. Needless to say, the Public Announcement on November 03, 2007, the Letter of Offer as well as the Post Offer Public Announcement dated April 04, 2008 filed pursuant to completion of offer is available on SEBI website, is in the public domain and there is no non-disclosure by us in this regard. We therefore, submit that we have made all the necessary disclosures at each and every step and there is no non - disclosure by any of the Noticee either singly or jointly at any step.  5. The Open Offer was made after carrying out all the necessary formalities under Regulation 10 and Regulation 12 of the SAST Regulations, 1997 and the SAST Regulations, 1997 nowhere  Adjudication order in the matter of Starcom Information Technology Limited  Page 5 of 27   casts an obligation on the Acquirers to have filed the disclosures under Regulation 7(1) read with Regulation 7(2) of the SAST Regulation, 1997.  6. However, pursuant to the said acquisition and after completion of the takeover offer, we were advised by the professionals to file the disclosure under Regulation 7(1) and Regulation 7(2) of the SAST Regulations, hence we filed the same.  7. In view of the above, it is submitted that the shares of JFL were acquired pursuant to the Open Offer after following all the necessary compliances and there was no stipulation to file any disclosures under Regulation 7(1) read with Regulation 7(2) of the SAST Regulations, 1997. Hence, there was no malafide intention behind delayed disclosure, therefore, the alleged violation of Regulation 7(1) read with Regulation 7(2) of SEBI (SAS1) Regulations, 1997 and consequent issue of the SCN is void ab initio.  8. The trading in the shares of JFL was suspended at BSE w.e.f May 13, 2002, for non-compliance with Clause 41 of the Listing Agreement and the shareholders were not able to unlock the value of investment. Pursuant to acquisition, the necessary compliances were carried out by the new management of JFL and vide notice dated August 12, 2008 BSE revoked the suspension on trading of shares of the Company.  9. It is pertinent to note that each and every information was already available in public domain and there was no material information which was hidden from the general investor or the public at large wherein the Noticees gained any unfair advantage or it resulted in loss to investors.  10. Considering the above, we deny that I and/ or any of the Noticees individually and/ or collectively have violated Regulation 7(1) and Regulation 7(2) of SAST Regulations, 1997.  Our reply to the said notice is as under: -  11. At the outset and without prejudice to anything stated hereinafter, I deny all the allegations and findings made against us in the said notice except to the extent specifically admitted by us. Nothing contained in the said notice may be deemed to be admitted by reason of non-traverse or otherwise, save and except what is expressly admitted herein. I deny all the statements, submissions, contentions, allegations and averments contained in the said notice that are contrary to and/ or inconsistent with what is stated herein below.  12. We categorically deny that I and/ or any of the Noticees individually and/ or collectively have violated Regulation 7(1) read with Regulation 7(2) of SAST Regulations, 1997.  Adjudication order in the matter of Starcom Information Technology Limited  Page 6 of 27    13. We submit that the Noticees made a Public Announcement collectively as per Regulation 10 & 12 of the SAST Regulations, 1997 on November 03, 2007 to acquire the shares of ]FL, which was later on renamed as Starcom Information Technology Limited. A copy of the Public announcement as available on SEBI website is annexed hereto at Exhibit A.  14. Prior to said public announcement, the Noticees entered into SPA with the promoter group shareholders of JFL to acquire 34,99,980 Equity Shares, each fully paid up, representing 69.99% of shareholding of JFL.  15.  The SPA necessitated the Open Offer in terms of Regulation 10 and 12 of SAST Regulations, 1997. Pursuant to the open offer, the Noticees acquired a total of 72.31 % collectively of the shareholding of JFL. The Noticees also filed the requisite report dated April 4, 2008 under SAST Regulations, 1997 with SEBI informing all the details of the said acquisition. A copy of the said report as available of SEBI website is annexed hereto Exhibit B.  16. The Public Announcement dated November 03, 2007, the Letter of Offer as well as the Post Offer Public announcement dated April 04, 2008 filed pursuant to the letter of offer are available in the public domain. It is pertinent to note that each and every information was already available in public domain and there was no material information which was hidden from the general investor or the public at large.  17. The open offer was made by all the Noticees collectively and the total acquisition of 72.31 % of total shares were also acquired collectively. As per the Letter of Offer, Shri. Anil Raika & his wife Smt Ambika Raika acquired 50% of the Shares covered under the Agreement and also 50% of the Shares accepted through the Open Offer. The balance 50% was acquired by Shri. Mahesh Saraf and his wife Smt. Sarita Saraf. The details of the same are as under: -  S.no.  Name of the acquirer Percentage of shares 1.  Shri Anil Raika & Smt Ambika Raika 36.15% 2.  Shri. Mahesh Saraf & Smt. Sarita Saraf 36.15%  18. The Open Offer was made after carrying out all the necessary formalities under Regulation 10 and Regulation 12 of the SAST Regulations, 1997 and nowhere the SAST Regulations, 1997 casts an obligation on the Acquirers to file disclosures under Regulation 7(1) read with Regulation 7(2) of the SAST Regulation, 1997. However, pursuant to the said acquisition we were advised by the professionals to file the disclosure under Regulation 7(1) read with Regulation 7(2) of the SAST Regulations, thereafter we filed the same.  Adjudication order in the matter of Starcom Information Technology Limited  Page 7 of 27    19. Nevertheless, it is submitted that there was no intention to violate any provision of SEBI Act or any regulation made thereunder. The said disclosures were carried out by us as a precautionary measure as informed by our Company Secretary in and around December 2008. We made that disclosure immediately on having been informed hence, there was no intention to violate any Regulation. The delay, if any, is not intentional and same was due to the fact that the Noticees had acquired the shares through open offer and such disclosure was not stipulated under Regulation 10 and Regulation 12 of the SAST Regulations.  20. We reiterate that the trading in the shares of JFL was suspended at BSE w.e.f May 13, 2002, for non-compliance with Clause 41 of the Listing Agreement and the shareholders were not able to unlock the value of investment. Pursuant to acquisition, the necessary compliances were carried out by the new management of JFL and vide notice dated August 12, 2008 BSE revoked the suspension on trading of shares of the Company.  21. We submit that the violation, if any, was venial in nature and same was totally unintentional. That as part of good corporate governance practices and to honor the right of shareholders to be aware of the happenings in their company, the Noticees have filed the said disclosures.  22. It is also pertinent to note that the intention of both the post offer public announcement as well as Regulation 7(1) read with Regulation 7(2) of the SAST Regulations, is dissemination of information which was already done by the Noticees through post offer public announcement. Further, no material harm has been caused to investors for failure to make disclosure under the same as similar disclosure was already filed by the Noticee through post offer public announcement. Hence, it is submitted that such delay was merely procedural and technical in nature, due to inadvertence and was totally devoid of any malafide intention.  23. We submit that there were no investor complaint and we did not hide any information from the investors. Further, we did not have any intention to conceal any information from investors or give any wrong information, neither did we have any unfair gain or advantage nor any loss or harm was caused to the investors with the delayed disclosure of the said information. Further, it is submitted that all the information has been disclosed before and after the company was acquired.  24. We submit that we have been law abiding citizens of the country and regular tax payers. We have followed the procedures, as stipulated by regulatory authorities, abided by the rules, regulations, instructions etc. issued by government agencies, and our intention has always been to comply with the rules/ regulations/ filings etc. and not to conceal any information. We further submit that we have not been penalized by any regulatory authority till date. We further  Adjudication order in the matter of Starcom Information Technology Limited  Page 8 of 27   undertake that in future too, we shall comply with the acts, rules, regulations etc., in letter and in spirit, and would not violate any of the provision of any Act, rules, and regulations etc. of any regulatory authority.  25. In view of the above, we categorically deny that I and/ or any of the Noticees individually and/ or collectively have violated Regulation 7(1) read with Regulation 7(2) of SAST Regulations, 1997.    LEGAL SUBMISSIONS:  As regards delay in initiation of proceedings  26. We submit that the proceedings suffer from the latches of inordinate delay since the non-disclosure or open offer violation relate to the period of 2007-2008 which is around 9 to 10 years prior to the issue of SCN. On this ground alone the proceedings should be dropped. We wish to rely upon the following judgements of Hon'ble Supreme Court and Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal: -  (i) The Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Ashok Shivlal Rupani & Anr. vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 417 of 2018, Order dated 22.08.2019) held as follows:-  \"9. As a result, without going into the merits of the case, we are of the opinion that on account of inordinate delay the initiation of proceedings by issuance of the show cause notice which culminated into a penalty order cannot be sustained. The show cause notice and the impugned orders passed by the AO are quashed. Both the appeals are allowed.\"  The aforesaid order was upheld by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of SEBI v Ashok Shivlal Rupani & Anr. (Civil Appeal No. 8444- 8445 /2019) vide order dated November 15, 2019 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court dismissed the Appeal stating that they find no ground to interfere with the impugned order passed by the Hon'ble Tribunal.  (ii) In the case of Adjudicating Officer, Securities and Exchange Board of India vs. Bhavesh Pabari (Civil Appeal No. 11311 of 2013), on February 28, 2019 the Apex Court of the country has observed the following at Para 36 of its Order:  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. There are judgments which hold that when the period of limitation is not prescribed, such power must be exercised within a reasonable time. What would be reasonable  Adjudication order in the matter of Starcom Information Technology Limited  Page 9 of 27   time, would depend upon the facts and circumstances of the case, nature of the default/statute, prejudice caused, whether the third party rights had been created etc\\\\\\\\u2026......\\\\\\\\u201d  (iii) The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the case of Bharat J Patel Vs SEBI (Appeal No. 154 of 2020, decided on 08.9.2020) allowed the appeal on the ground of delay of 7 years and held as under: -  \\\\\\\\u201c10. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, in our view, the appeal deserves to be allowed for the following reason: a. The facts on record would show that the disputed trades were carried out by the Appellant in the year 2012. The show cause notice was issued to them on July 10, 2019 i.e. after a gap of 7 years. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.. b. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. This Tribunal in the case of Ashok Shivlal Rupani & Ors. vs. SEBI, Sanjay Jethalal Soni & Ors. vs SEBI and Anilkumar Nandkumar Harchandani & Ors. vs. SEBI cited supra has reiterated this principle and on facts of those cases set aside the orders passed against them by the Respondent. c. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026 d. In the circumstances, the appeal is allowed without any order as to costs. The impugned order passed against the present Appellants is thereby quashed and set aside.\\\\\\\\u201d  (iv) The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Tribunal in its decision in the case of ICICI Bank Limited v SEBI (Appeal No. 583 of 2019) dated July 08, 2020 held that undue delay in initiating the proceedings by the Regulatory Authority causes prejudice and would ultimately attach a stigma pursuant to any adverse order that may be passed later on. For ready reference the relevant paragraph, Para 30 of the order is being reproduced here under:-  \\\\\\\\u201cHowever, we agree with the contentions of the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant on the inordinate delay in issuing the show cause notice and in passing the impugned order by respondent SEBI. The disclosure violations had been noticed by SEBI soon thereafter and a preliminary\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. the delay on the part of SEBI to show cause is 2955 days from the date of the event and about 2130 days from the date of the preliminary investigation report, which is too wide a gap to be ignored. Several years\\\\\\\\u2019 delay in show-causing and concluding proceedings in such known incidence of violation / alleged violations is a failure in effectively performing the behavior modification function of a market regulator. The orders relied on by SEBI on the ground of delay are distinguishable from the facts of this matter.  Therefore, we are of the considered view that issuance of a penalty order against the appellant in September, 2019 for certain disclosure violations in mid-May 2010 by issuing a show cause  Adjudication order in the matter of Starcom Information Technology Limited  Page 10 of 27   notice on June 26, 2018 has caused prejudice to the appellant and the order suffers from laches, as held in this Tribunal\\\\\\\\u2019s Order in the matter of Ashok Rupani (supra).\\\\\\\\u201d  We submit that the lapse of almost 10 years has gravely prejudiced our ability to defend ourselves and we are not be able to retrieve crucial physical and electronic data. Our case squarely falls in the above orders passed by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court and Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT since there has been delay of nearly nine to ten years in the issue of the SCN after the alleged transactions. The undue delay in issuing the SCN has vitiated the whole proceeding and on the basis of consistent view taken by the higher courts, the proceedings may be dropped, no penalty may be levied and an order passed accordingly.  As regards Levy of Penalty  27. We rely upon the following judgements passed by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Courts/ Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT/ Ld. WTM of SEBI which conclude that if the breach is merely technical and unintentional, penalty may not be levied. The relevant paragraphs of the judgements relied upon are as follows:  a. In the order passed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Tribunal in the matter of Vitro Commodities Private Limited v SEBI, decided on September 09, 2013, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Tribunal held as follows: \\\\\\\\u201cIt may be noticed that provisions of Regulations 7(1) of Takeover Regulations, 1997 and Regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations, 1992 are not substantially different, since violation of first automatically triggers violation of second and hence there is no justification for imposition of penalty for second violation when penalty for first violation has been imposed. It may be seen that Regulation 7(1) of Takeover Regulations, 1997 and Regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations, 1992 are not stand alone Regulations and one is corollary of other\\\\\\\\u201d.  b. In the order passed by the Ld. Adjudicating Officer (\\\\\\\\u201cAO\\\\\\\\u201f) w.r.t Bakulesh Trambakal Shah in the matter of Aanjaneya Lifecare Limited, dated May 12, 2017, the Ld. AO has not levied any penalty and held as follows:  \\\\\\\\u201c20. In view of the above, I note that the noticee have filed timely disclosures to both the Company and the stock exchanges under Regulation 29 (1) read with 29 (3) of SAST Regulations, 2011. But he failed to file disclosure to Company in terms of Regulation 13.  Adjudication Order against Shri Bakulesh Trambaklal Shah in the matter of Aanjaneya Lifecare Limited (now known as Dr. Datsons Labs Ltd.) Page 10 of 10 (1) of PIT Regulations, 1992, with regard to the acquisition of 10,37,092 shares on 12.04.2013. The Company in turn has to inform the aforesaid disclosure under Regulation 13 (6) of PIT Regulations, 1992 to the stock exchange. Both the disclosures under Regulation 29 (1) of SAST Regulations, 2011 and Regulation 13 (1) of PIT Regulations, 1992 are quite similar in nature. It is also pertinent to  Adjudication order in the matter of Starcom Information Technology Limited  Page 11 of 27   note that the intention of both the Regulations is dissemination of information. On filing of said disclosures under Regulation 29 (1) of SAST Regulations, 2011, by the noticee which was similar to the erstwhile Regulation 7 (1) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 1997, the essential information about the said acquisition of shares had already been disseminated to the general public. Under the above circumstances, the noticee having complied with regulation 29 (1) of SAST Regulations, 2011, the non-compliance of Regulation 13 (1) of SEBI PIT Regulations, 1992, may not be viewed seriously and be visited with any penalty following the decision of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Vitro Commodities Private Limited cited supra\\\\\\\\u201d. (emphasis supplied)  c. In the order passed by the Ld. AO w.r.t Mr. Dineshbhai Shahanabhai Patel and Dinesh Allogra Limited in the matter of Dinesh Allogra Limited dated June 15, 2017, the Ld. AO has not levied any penalty and held as follows \\\\\\\\u2013  \\\\\\\\u201cI find that change in shareholding of Noticee 2 was disclosed by stock exchange on its website under provisions of SAST Regulations and as such investors were informed of the same. No material harm has been caused to investors for failure to make disclosure under PIT Regulations as similar disclosures were otherwise made under SAST Regulations. I find that Noticee 1 is otherwise regular with all statutory compliances with respect to filing with exchanges. I, therefore, term this violation as technical in nature. In the similar instance, the Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Vitro Commodities Private Limited vs SEBI, inter-alia opined that \\\\\\\\u201cthe provisions of Regulations 7(1) of Takeover Regulations, 1997 and Regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations are not substantially different, since, violation of first automatically triggers the violation of second and hence, there is no justification for imposition of penalty for second violation when penalty for first violation has been imposed.\\\\\\\\u201d In view of above I do not find it a fit case to levy monetary penalty and investor\\\\\\\\u2019s interest was not adversely affected on account of failure of Noticee 1 and Noticee 2 to file disclosure with exchange in terms of Regulation  13(3) read with regulation 13(5) and 13(6) of PIT Regulations.\\\\\\\\u201d (emphasis supplied)  We submit that our case is squarely covered under the above three judgements wherein Hon\\\\\\\\u201fble SAT and Ld. Adjudicating Officers have held that wherein the disclosures have been made under one Regulations and not made under other similar regulations, same cannot be viewed seriously and penalty was not levied since the intention of both the Regulations is dissemination of information which was achieved.  Adjudication order in the matter of Starcom Information Technology Limited  Page 12 of 27   d. In the matter of Parnami Credits Ltd., Ld. AO vide its order dated October 30, 2017, levied a penalty of Rs. 1 lakh only on seven persons of the same promoter group for violation of Regulation 29(2) read with 29 (3) of SAST Regulations, 2011.  e. In the order passed by the Ld. AO w.r.t Mr. Anand Karbhari in the matter of Jindal Cortex Ltd, dated May 11, 2017, the Ld. AO had levied only minimum penalty of \\\\\\\\u20b91,00,000 and held as follows: \\\\\\\\u2013  \\\\\\\\u201cWith regard to the above factors to be considered while determining the quantum of penalty, it is noted that the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee or loss caused to the investors as a result of the failure on the part of the Noticee to make required disclosures within the time required are not available on record. Further, there is nothing on record to show that the acquisition of shares by the Noticee beyond 5% was repeated. Noticee held 5.13% of the share capital of the target company as per the disclosure made by the target company for the quarter ending March 2014\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  Considering the facts and circumstances of the case the Ld. Adjudicating officer levied a nominal monetary penalty of Rs One (1) Lakh only under Section 15A(b) for alleged violation of Regulation 13(1) of SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992 and Regulation 29(1) read with 29(3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011.  f. In the case of Refex Industries Limited (formerly known as Refex Refrigerants Limited), wherein the acquirer has violated Regulation 11(2) of SAST Regulations, 1997 by acquiring additional 42 shares in September 2008 since his holding was between 55% and 75%, the Ld. WTM vide its order dated February 02, 2017, did not issue any directions against the promoter and director to give open offer and inter-alia held as follows:-  \\\\\\\\u201c13. On an overall assessment of the facts and circumstances of the case, I am inclined to arrive at the following conclusions: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 that there is a violation of regulation 11(2) of the Takeover regulations, 1997 by    the Noticee; \\\\\\\\uf0b7 that the violation is un-intentional and not for consolidation \\\\\\\\uf0b7 that the violation is technical and venial in nature; \\\\\\\\uf0b7 and that there are clear mitigating circumstances in the form of subsequent amendments to the takeover regulations which further lessens the gravity of the violation.\\\\\\\\u201d  g. Reliance Industries Ltd. v SEBI (SAT Appeal No. 39/2002):  Adjudication order in the matter of Starcom Information Technology Limited  Page 13 of 27   In the above case, the notice company had failed to make relevant disclosure in time under Regulation 7(1) of Takeover Regulations, and Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT observed as \\\\\\\\u2013  \"The High Court in Cabot's case has pronounced that if a breach was merely technical and unintentional, it does not merit penal consequence. It ultimately depends on the facts of each case.\\\\\\\\u201d  h. Akbar Badrudin Badrudin Jiwani V. Collector of Customs, Bombay (AIR 1990 SC 1579): It is noteworthy to mention wherein the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court had stated the following \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201c61. We refer in this connection the decision of Merck Spares v. Collector of Central Excise & Customs, New Delhi, 1983 ELT 1261, Shama Engine Valves Ltd.., Bombay v. Collector of Customs, Bombay (1984) 18 ELT 533 and Madhusudhan Gordhandas & Co. v. Collector of Customs, Bombay, (1987) 29 ELT 904, wherein it has been held that in imposing penalty the requisite mens rea has to be established\\\\\\\\u201d.  i. Hindustan Steel Ltd., v State of Orissa, (1970) 1 SCR 753; (AIR 1970 SC 2563) The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court held as follows \\\\\\\\u2013 \"The discretion to impose a penalty must be exercised judicially. A penalty will ordinarily be imposed in cases where the party acts deliberately in defiance of law, or is guilty of contumacious or dishonest conduct, or acts in conscious disregard to its obligation; but not, in cases where there is a technical or venial breach of the provisions of the Act or where the breach flows from a bona fide belief that the offender is not liable to act in the manner prescribed by the statute\".  We submit that our violation, if any, is technical and venial in nature and same is unintentional, hence going by judicial precedents, no penalty may be levied.  28.  In view of the above circumstances and as we did not have any intention to conceal information, no unfair gain or advantage has occurred to the Noticees and also no harm or loss has been caused to retail investors, your honor is kindly requested to take a lenient view in the matter and penalty stipulated under Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act may not be imposed. It is further requested that the present proceedings under Show Cause Notice dated December 29, 2017 may be dropped and the Noticees may be discharged from the same and an order may be passed accordingly.  29. We reserve the right to add, delete or modify our submissions and to refer to and rely upon case law as and when required.\\\\\\\\u201d  Adjudication order in the matter of Starcom Information Technology Limited  Page 14 of 27   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS  7. I have perused the written submissions of the Noticees and the documents available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are :  (a) Whether the Noticees have violated the provisions of regulation 7(1) read with regulation 7(2) of the SAST Regulations?  (b) Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act?  (c) If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?  FINDINGS 8. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of the SAST Regulations, which reads as under: SAST Regulations: 7 (1) Any acquirer, who acquires shares or voting rights which taken together with shares or voting rights, if any, held by him, would entitle him to more than five per cent or ten per cent or fourteen per cent or fifty four per cent or seventy four per cent shares or voting rights in a company, in any manner whatsoever, shall disclose at every stage the aggregate of his shareholding or", "Date": "2021-04-30", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Adjudication Order in respect of four entities in the matter of Starcom Information Technology Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/apr-2021/adjudication-order-in-respect-of-four-entities-in-the-matter-of-starcom-information-technology-limited_50024.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 62314, "unique_record_id": "309fb630ceSEBI20210430", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6681de4e7858910306472c34", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 22:37:36", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Disclosure Failings", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "$1,00,000", "gpt_audience": "- Investors and shareholders of Starcom Information Technology Limited\n- Regulatory authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\n- Legal professionals and compliance officers\n- Financial analysts and market researchers\n- Company management and board members of Starcom Information Technology Limited\n- Auditors and financial consultants\n- Media and financial journalists\n- Potential acquirers and merger & acquisition specialists", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

The allegations levelled against the Noticee in the SCN are summarized in the following paragraphs.   Adjudication Order in respect of in the matter of Angel Broking Ltd.  Page 3 of 28  7. A special purpose inspection  was conducted  by SEBI on May 08, 2014, period  of inspection  being 2008 to 2013. The  scope of the said inspection  was to examine the  systems put  in  place  by the  Noticee  and compliance thereof regarding the  provisions/ circulars / guidelines  with  respect  to  account   opening  forms (\\\\\\\\u201cAoF\\\\\\\\u201d)/ Know Your Client (\\\\\\\\u201cKYC\\\\\\\\u201d). The inspection  findings were based on the analysis of 26 AoF/KYC and other records.   8. The  Noticee  had  received  a grievance  from  one Mr  Surendra  Kayal (based in Kolkata) regarding fraudulent  transfer, dematerialization and  offloading of his shares. The Noticee checked  and found  that Mr Kayal was not its client and had demat account with SHCIL, Kolkata. However it was observed that the demat account  in  which  the  alleged  shares  were  credited belonged  to  its  client  viz. Surendra Prakash Kayal (based in Mumbai). The Noticee has confirmed that both the persons had same name but were different persons. Thereafter  the Noticee approached MIDC police station and initiated an investigation in the matter.  9. The  Noticee found that the alleged shares (6250 shares of Arshiya International Ltd.) of Mr Kayal (Kolkata) were submitted by him to the Registrar and Share Transfer Agent (in this case Bigshare) for dematerialization in his demat account maintained with SHCIL. However, these shares  were credited into  the demat account  of Mr  Surendra Prakash Kayal (Mumbai) in the demat  account maintained with them on October 12, 2010 and sold in two tranches on October 14, 2010 (4250 shares) and October  15, 2010 (2000 shares). There was another transaction pertaining to dematerialization and sale of  3300  shares  of  Global Securities in the demat account of Mr Kayal (Mumbai). The Noticee confirmed that these shares did not belong to Mr  Kayal (Kolkata) after verifying with him.  10. The Noticee found   that 26  clients  had  made  requests   for dematerialization of shares of scrips viz. Global Securities/ Arshiya (during the period 2010 to   Adjudication Order in respect of in the matter of Angel Broking Ltd.  Page 4 of 28  2012). Accordingly, account opening documents of these  26 clients were verified and it was found that they are imposters with assumed names and fake identities. The Noticee observed that some of these clients had opened accounts in different  names with different addresses but  had  used same or  similar looking photographs through its different branches at different point of time. As part of due diligence the Noticee had frozen all these 26 accounts and confirmed  that it had started maintaining copies of the share certificates given for dematerialization by all its clients, since May 2013.  11. On perusal of the account opening forms (AoF)/ KYC documents including Proof of Identity (POI) such as PAN Card and Proof of Address (POA) attached along with 26 forms, following was observed:- a. Procedural  inconsistencies   were  observed  like  the  place  and  date  was  not mentioned by the clients in most of the AOFs. b. It  was observed  that  the  photographs in  the PAN  card  were same/similar whereas other  details such  as name, father's  name etc. were totally different. These 26 instances have been broadly divided in 5 Groups  (A-E) based  on the similarities in photographs observed by the inspection  team.

In view of the above, the Noticee was alleged to be not in compliance with Clause 4, Clause 16 and Clause 19 of Code of Conduct read with Regulation 20AA of SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulation, 1996.   15. Clause 4 of the Code of Conduct of SEBI(Depositories and Participants) Regulations states that a Participant shall be prompt and diligent in opening of a beneficial owner account, dispatch of the Dematerialisation Request Form, Rematerialisation Request Form and execution of Debit Instruction Slip  and in all the other activities undertaken by him on behalf of the beneficial owners.   16. Clause 16 of the Code of Conduct of SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations states that a Participant shall follow the Maker- Checker concept in all of its activities to ensure the accuracy of the data and as a mechanism to check unauthorized transaction.   17. Clause  19 of  the  Code  of  Conduct  of  SEBI(Depositories  and  Participants) Regulations states that a Participant shall ensure that it has satisfactory internal control procedures in place as well as adequate financial and operational capabilities which can be reasonably expected to take care of any losses  arising   Adjudication Order in respect of in the matter of Angel Broking Ltd.  Page 8 of 28  due  to  theft,  fraud  and  other   dishonest   acts,  professional  misconduct   or omissions.   18. Regulation 20AA of SEBI(Depositories  and Participants) Regulations states that the participant holding a certificate of initial or permanent registration shall, at all times, abide by the Code of Conduct as specified in Third Schedule.   19. The aforesaid alleged violations/non-compliance, if established, make the Noticee liable for monetary penalty under Section 15 HB of the SEBI Act.  20. In response to the SCN, vide letter dated 23.11.2015, the Noticee requested inspection of  all such  documents and records  in  possession  of  SEBI in  connection with the present  matter, including but  not limited to statements recorded by SEBI, if any, Investigation Report  and findings, as well as any correspondence exchanged by SEBI with third parties in this regard. The request was considered and responded to vide letter dated 30.11.2015 stating that documents relied upon in the SCN were based on the observations of the inspection team, and that the said observations had already been communicated to the Noticee vide letter dated 08.07.2014.  21. Accordingly, vide letter dated 08.12.2015, the Noticee submitted its preliminary response to the SCN stating the following:- a) The present proceedings had bene initiated without the benefit of the complete factual background. b) Ongoing SEBI investigation is based on the internal investigation conducted by the Noticee, which was reported to police authorities after receipt of Mr. Surendra Kayal\\\\\\\\u2019s (Kolkata) complaint in March 2013. Noticee also lodged a Suspicious Transaction Report with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in April 2013.  c) Noticee has been the victim of a large-scale fraud and has demonstrated its bonafides in the ongoing investigation.   Adjudication Order in respect of in the matter of Angel Broking Ltd.  Page 9 of 28   22. During the personal hearing conducted on 11.12.2015, the Authorised Representatives of the Noticee reiterated the submissions made in letter dated 08.12.2015.   23. Subsequently, vide reply dated 08.01.2016, the Noticee submitted the following:- a) Inspection has been denied to the Noticees b) SCN is silent on identifying the manner in which the provisions of law have been breached by the Noticee c) Noticee is one of the prominent broking institutions in the country with 112 branches and 750000 clients d) Noticee has often, as in the present case, undertaken suo motu steps to upgrade its surveillance mechanism for monitoring activities of its clients and business associates and volunteered to promptly report any irregularities to the competent authorities. e) In April 2013 the Noticee filed a report with the EOW on the basis of its field investigation of transactions in the account of Mr. Surendra Kayal (Mumbai) and 25 other clients. Noticee found that 26 clients including Surendra Kayal (Mumbai) dematerialised shares which did not belong to them, of a company called Global Securities, a listed company. The Noticee scrutinised the accounting opening forms (AOFs) of the said 26 clients and found that they were opened by individuals with different names and identities but similar or same photographs. This is a case of identity theft, and this is the reason the fraudsters misused the surveillance systems and victimised several entities. It was impossible for any entity with however strong surveillance system to detect or even suspect foul play at the time when these accounts were opened. The account holders of these 26 accounts were imposters and belonged to an organised group of fraudsters who managed to produce all relevant and authentic identity documents. All PAN were unique and bank accounts active and running when the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 accounts were opened. The scam unearthed by the Noticee was a market-wide scam which had compromised the surveillance   Adjudication Order in respect of in the matter of Angel Broking Ltd.  Page 10 of 28  and vigilance mechanism of a lot of people agencies and intermediaries including the banking system and PAN issuing authorities. f) The following due diligence was observed while opening the demat and trading account of the said 26 clients across various branches:- i. When a potential client approaches  Noticee for opening  a demat and trading account with Noticee, Noticee undertakes in-person verification of the said client and scrutiny /verification of the mandatory documents that are required for opening the account. The originals are seen and verified and copies of the same are retained. The said verification process is mandatorily undertaken by Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s employees or our registered sub broker. ii. The  mandatory  documents   namely  the   Permanent  Account  Number (\"PAN\") and documents  in support of identification and residence is verified. Verification  of  PAN is done on the interface  provided by the Income  Tax  department. In case of any  discrepancies,  such  client  is contacted for further verification and informed of the mismatch in PAN, if any. The aforesaid process ensures that the PAN details actually exist on Income Tax web site which is a Central Government database. iii. The bank statements and financial credentials are also obtained and verified. iv. A cancelled cheque is obtained from the client which contains all the bank particulars. v. Once the AOF and KYC documents are signed and executed by the said client, all the documents are forwarded to Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s central office which has a robust system support for performing this process. vi. Detailed verification of documents and their validity is carried out at central office  by  maker  and  checker  principle  as  prescribed  by  SEBI.  After verifying all the details and credentials including the bank account statements,  the  application  forms  are  either  rejected  with  reasons  or accepted for data entry, if the same is in order.   Adjudication Order in respect of in the matter of Angel Broking Ltd.  Page 11 of 28  vii. Before opening  an  account,  Noticee also  verifies  client  details  with  various negative lists such as SEBI debarred entities, UNSC list etc. viii. The depository accounts are then activated in the back office and depository systems as per the procedure prescribed by SEBI. ix. KYC details are  then  uploaded  on the  Know  your  Client  Registration Authority (\"KRA\") and concurrent audit is carried out in the matter. x. Once the process of verification  and account opening is completed, the Welcome Kit and all other necessary documents are dispatched to the respective clients.  g) Noticee had in place the aforesaid account opening process when said 26 accounts were opened. All the said 26 accounts were opened after due verification and scrutiny. Based on a review of all the AOF and KYC particulars of the said 26 clients, it was observed that the proof of address and proof of identity were mainly the Ration Card, PAN card, bank statement/cancelled cheque of an active bank account. On verification of PAN through the income tax site, it was found that the details of all 26 were available in the income tax records which confirmed the authenticity of the  PAN. Noticee had opened these 26 accounts relying on the authenticity of identification document i.e. PAN card issued  by the  Income  Tax  Department.  Copy  of printout  taken from Income  Tax Department was attached as 'Annexure A\". h) Further, all the 26 clients had given bank account details and a cancelled cheque. The credentials and details contained in the cheque issued towards account opening fees and initial margin matched with the details in the bank statements and the cheques were all honoured which further evidenced credibility of the said 26 entities. i) On analysis of aforesaid account opening procedure and process undertaken to open the account of 26 clients, there is no dispute to the fact that the same were opened in compliance with the rules prescribed by SEBI and the stock exchanges.   Adjudication Order in respect of in the matter of Angel Broking Ltd.  Page 12 of 28  j) There has been no grievance at all from any quarters with respect to any of these 26 accounts until Noticee received the communication from Mr. Kayal (Kolkata). On coming to know that his shares in Arshiya International Ltd., have been dematerialized and credited to an account with Noticee which was opened by his name sake, Noticee set in motion a detailed investigation and also personally contacted Mr. Kayal (Kolkata), though he is not one of Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s clients, to elicit better and complete information about  the  nature  of  the  transactions.  This  establishes  Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s absolute  integrity  as responsible market intermediary and its honesty of purpose to protect the interest of investors even when the aggrieved party is not Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s client. k) It was because of intense investigation and laborious exercise that Noticee could find out that a fraud might have been perpetrated by holders/ operators of the 26 accounts, which was impossible to identify at the time of opening the account. It is  trite  law  that  each  and  every  market  intermediary  cannot  start  business  with suspicion in mind that a fraud is in the offing unless some facts exists on the face of some record that a normal man of ordinary prudence could have detected as probable signs of a fraud. Noticee most respectfully and humbly repeat and reiterate that there has been no loophole or lacuna in the account opening for these 26 clients. Noticee has put in place satisfactory controls and procedure reasonably expected from it as a market intermediary and has complied with all the mandatory requirements in this regard. It is not the case of SEBI that Noticee has not complied with any regulatory provisions. Therefore, in the absence of any specific requirement to begin with, Noticee respectfully submit that there cannot be any adverse observation against Noticee regarding the satisfactory controls and procedure as well as Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s financial capabilities. Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s controls and  risk  management  systems  are  formulated  based  on  ordinary  prudence  and reasonable approach  and the mandatory requirements wherever prescribed by SEBI.  It is contextual to state that given the technological capability even today, it is not possible to compare the photographs through any software system to generate alerts of duplicity of   Adjudication Order in respect of in the matter of Angel Broking Ltd.  Page 13 of 28  photographs used to open accounts in different points in time at different locations. l) The present proceedings would not have been initiated and there would have been no regulatory intervention in the matter, had Noticee not reported the irregularities to the Police department. However, Noticee considered it appropriate to take steps to resolve the issues and also to bring the perpetrators of the fraud to book. Therefore, Noticee has blown the whistle to safeguard and protect the interest of investors at large who could be victims of such fraudulent activities. m) With respect to the observations contained in the Inspection Report, Noticee would like to repeat, reiterate and confirm the submissions made in their reply dated July 25, 2014 to the Inspection  Report. It is submitted  again that as a regular practice, in all forms accepted by Noticee (including the impugned 26 forms) all mandatory information and documents have been captured and procured. All documents were verified and recorded as required by the guidelines then prevailing. Each account is opened after passing of tests at different authorities such as Income  Tax, Banks and other authorities issuing address proofs. It is reiterated that it is not possible for any authority to identify the uniformity of photographs of applicants when other verifiable details are uncommon. n) As  regards  the  observation  that applicants  having  same/similar  photographs  have opened multiple accounts in different names, Noticee would like to reiterate that they all have produced valid original documentary proof in support of their claimed identity in the form  of  PAN, bank statements, cancelled cheque leaf, ration card and driving license. It was, therefore, impossible by normal human intelligence to detect that the person seeking to open an account on the basis of these identity proofs obtained from different authorities was an imposter bearing pseudo name. It is also relevant to note in this context that these persons presented themselves to open such proxy account at different points in time and different places.   Adjudication Order in respect of in the matter of Angel Broking Ltd.  Page 14 of 28  o) As regards common addresses used for opening of accounts, it was submitted that in case of the accounts where the BOs have the titles \"Shah\"/\"Mody\" as part of their names, they belonged to the same families as evidenced by the ration cards they produced as address proof. Copy of said ration cards are annexed hereto and marked as \"Annexure B\". With respect to other accounts with common addresses, it was submitted that these accounts were opened at different branches at different times by submitting different address proofs and therefore it was not possible to identify them as attempted frauds. Further, in these cases though the addresses of clients are same but the method of writing is different. A statement  reflecting these differences  is annexed  hereto and marked as \"Annexure C\" to the reply. In such scenarios even with the help of central system it would be difficult to identify similarity by any market intermediary. p) With regard to common mobile number, it is submitted that Central Depository Services Limited issued a circular dated April 15, 2015 making it mandatory to capture separate mobile number and Email Id for clients effective from August 1, 2015. This was a recent circular in an ongoing process of improvement in KYC standards and this mandatory requirement never existed at the time of opening the accounts of 26 clients. There was no such regulatory requirement to capture separate mobile number for the Depository Accounts at the time of opening of the DP accounts. Nevertheless, even as early as in 2010, even though there was no regulatory requirement to restrict duplicity in mobile number across accounts, Noticee  as a matter of abundant precaution, introduced a self-imposed restriction on opening accounts not more than .3 with the same mobile number. This restriction was effectively at work and there are no instances of more than 3 accounts getting opened using the same mobile number  in the instant case. A copy of the CDSL Circular dated April  15, 2015 was annexed and marked as \"Annexure D\". q) From what has been submitted hereinabove, it is evident that none of the regulatory guidelines  or  circulars,  including  clauses  4,  16  and  19  of  code   Adjudication Order in respect of in the matter of Angel Broking Ltd.  Page 15 of 28  of  conduct  and Regulation 20AA of DP Regulations  invoked in the SCN have been violated by the Noticee. r) As a responsible intermediary in market, Noticee has further introduced several additional checks and controls to ensure market integrity and protect the interest of investors. As of now, the key control measures worth noting are as under:- i. Installation of system at Branches to search for common mobile numbers and email ID (in advance of regulatory circulars) and PAN - On receipt of duly filled  KYC at any  branch, entry is made in the Inward Register module. While entering the information, in case the mobile number and email Id are  found to be matching  with those in the database of any other existing clients, for such cases an exception check is carried out to ascertain whether the clients are related to one another as members of same family. If they are, then in that case a declaration  is obtained from the client  verifying their relations as members of same family. The aforesaid process ensures that the same mobile number or email id are not used to open multiple accounts, where the account holders do not belong to same family. ii. Verification through tele-verification desk - Once  forms  are  received  at  Central  Support  Office  (CSO)  from  branches, tete-verification desk established at CSO contacts the clients to verify the genuineness  of  the  mobile  numbers  and  to  seek  confirmation  about  the correctness of important details in his/ her account such as email ID and address of the client after verifying client's credentials like date of birth, PAN, Address etc. Based on tele-verification, in case of suspicious, the account is deactivated. iii. Dispatch of Welcome Kit to client\\\\\\\\u2019s registered address as per KYC:- On  activation  of client, physical  Welcome Kit I DIS are dispatched to  the address mentioned in KYC form. If the said kit is returned undelivered, clients are contacted  to confirm the address. The  Welcome Kit is then sent to new address after obtaining necessary   Adjudication Order in respect of in the matter of Angel Broking Ltd.  Page 16 of 28  proofs and other documents. However, if for any reason client is not contactable, intimation is sent to the respective branch/ sub broker/ authorized person who had referred the client, informing them to follow-up  with client and provide  correct address and other details. If after issuing repeated reminders, the client is not contactable, the account of the client is deactivated and DIS issued, if any, is blocked and subsequently destroyed. This process ensures that the address provided by the client is valid and documents  actually  reach the client. Further, it establishes  the fact that the Noticee can communicate on the said address in future. iv. Concurrent audit - Post account opening, concurrent audit of entire account opening procedure is conducted. The observations  of the auditor are recorded and where required follow up processes are initiated to rectify curable defects in the documents. The aforesaid audit ensures that entire account opening process is being carried out in accordance with regulatory guidelines and reinforces internal risk control mechanism. v. Setting up of fraud detection team:- Dedicated fraud detection team of seven members has been created to look into potentially suspicious/ fraudulent transactions.  s) There is no case at all against the Noticee that it has not been prompt in opening the accounts. All the  regulatory  requirements,  procedural guidelines  and  circulars governing opening of accounts for the time being in force, when the 26 accounts in question were opened, had been meticulously complied with and the Noticee had in fact enforced more stringent control measures, which were otherwise not required to have been complied with by it as a regulatory requirement. Nonetheless, as soon as a complaint received by it even though from a non-client, the Noticee had with all promptitude and diligence carried out a thorough investigation to get at the root of the matter and also reported its findings for criminal investigation to competent   Adjudication Order in respect of in the matter of Angel Broking Ltd.  Page 17 of 28  authorities.  The  flow  of  events  and  conduct  of  Noticee  as  explained  above establishes beyond the pale of any doubt that it was diligent, alert and forthright in maintaining market integrity and keen to curb and bring to book anyone violating the security of the market. The allegation that Noticee failed to comply with clause 4 of Code is a generic allegation unsubstantiated by any material ingredients that would establish such violations. t) Maker-checker  concept  is followed  in all activities to ensure the accuracy of the data and as a mechanism to check unauthorised transaction. With respect to account opening process, once the forms are received at central office, the Maker scrutinizes the documents as per the guidelines issued by regulators from time to time. Further the Checker, being more experienced than a Maker, checks all the documents and entries made by the Maker. Further, all the relevant processes such as account opening, DRF, DIS etc. have always been subject to concurrent audit.  u) Account opening process adopted by us was in compliance with appl.icable rules and provisions and in sync and conformity with the various rules, regulations, circulars and/or orders passed  by SEBI. SEBI has not set out any material details of any acts or omission on the part of the Noticee which would substantiate the allegation that it has violated clause 19 of code of conduct. The Noticee has operational and financial capabilities and nothing has been set out in the SCN to show to the contrary.

In view of the above, it has been alleged that the GDR issue would not have been subscribed had KIEL not given any such security towards the loan taken by Vintage and the entire scheme involving entering into Pledge Agreement, making corporate announcement that the GDRs were subscribed without disclosing the arrangement to the investors resulted in publication of misleading news to the stock exchanges which contained information in a distorted manner so as to influence the decision of the investors by creating a make belief picture that the GDR issue was genuinely subscribed.

It was also alleged that KIEL has not complied with the provisions of Section 21 of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCRA\\\\\\\\u2019) read with Clause 36 (7) of the erstwhile Equity Listing Agreement for not-informing BSE regarding entering into Pledge Agreement with EURAM Bank for giving security towards the loan taken by Vintage from EURAM Bank which was a price sensitive information so as to impact the price of the scrip of KIEL.

As the hearing in respect of the SCN was granted by the erstwhile AO as aforesaid, the undersigned deemed it fit to grant the Noticees another opportunity of personal hearing in the interest of the principle of natural justice. Accordingly, in terms of Rule 7 (b) of the SEBI Adjudication Rules, the Noticees were notified about personal hearing granted to them by the undersigned through WebEx platform on March 19, 2021.

Page 10 of 32    9. During the hearing, Noticee No. 1 made oral submissions on the lines of written reply filed by him vide his letter dated December 06, 2018. Noticee No. 2 made oral submissions on the lines of written reply filed by him vide his letters dated November 26, 2018 and January 28, 2019. Similarly, Noticee No. 3 made oral submissions on the lines of written reply filed by him vide his letters dated October 30, 2018 and November 26, 2018. Noticee No. 4 had already made submissions vide his letters dated October 05, 2018 and November 07, 2018.   10. The reply / submissions of the Noticees are summarized as follows:  Noticee No. 1:  a) He was Promoter of the Company holding 4.59% of the total share capital. He is a technocrat   with special expertise in the field of plastics technology, mechanical engineering & electrical engineering and was serving on the board of directors of the Company between November 1991 to May 2015.  b) The SCN pertains to alleged violations during the period April, 2010 - May 31,2010.  However, the same has been issued on September 17, 2018, i.e., after a delay of about 8 years. Such inordinate delay has caused great prejudice to him as since he resigned from the post of Chairman and Managing Director of the Company and has no access to any relevant documents for the purposes of filing of an effective reply. Further, the persons in the knowhow of the affairs and the persons responsible for maintaining relevant documents pertaining to the GDR issue have left the Company, thus making it impossible to trace and collate relevant documents and materials.  c) Vide his letter dated October 29, 2018, he had, inter alia, sought an inspection of all relevant documents in SEBI's records.  Vide SEBI letter dated November 2, 2018, his request was rejected on the ground that all documents relied on by SEBI have been provided to him along with the SCN. Thus, denying him inspection on the ground that all documents which were relied on in framing the charges against him have been provided to him is against the principles of natural justice.  d) SEBI has no jurisdiction over GDR issued in foreign jurisdiction unless the same has an adverse effect in Indian Securities Market, due to allied transactions in the underlying shares post conversion of GDRs. The SCN does not make such allegation and GDR issue was compliant______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of four entities in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd.  Page 11 of 32    with Foreign laws, hence it is not SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s jurisdiction to allege that such scheme of issuance of GDR was fraudulent.  e) GDR issue was done for financing the expansion needs of the Company (relating to carbon fibre production) and repayment of certain loans, hence they engaged a consultant who brought Vintage, an entity who was willing to subscribing to GDR issue of the Company. It was conveyed by this consultant, that Vintage was willing to subscribe to GDRs issued by the Company and thus, become an investor therein as it was immensely interested in investing in the upcoming products being planned by the Company including but not limited to carbon fiber. The process of issuance of GDRs was finalized as per such consultant and the Managing Director of Vintage's directions and GDRs of the Company were issued on April 29, 2010.  f) The Pledge Agreement was executed as per the advice of the consultant to the Board of Directors who advised that the same was compliant with all laws. Relevant disclosures about GDR issue have been made, therefore, as far as disclosure of Pledge Agreement is concerned, it becomes the discretion of the Board of Directors as to what needs to be disclosed. He had further relied on Clause 36 of the Listing Agreement to further support his argument and contended that such decision is protected by the Business Judgement Rule. Further, it was a collective decision of the board of directors of the Company and no special role with regards thereto has been ascribed to him in the SCN.  g) Vide board resolution dated March 16, 2010, he was authorized by the board of directors of the Company,  at the behest of the advsiors appointed  for the GDR Issuance, to draw cheques  and  other  documents,  and to give instructions  from  time to time as may be necessary to EURAM Bank or any branch of EURAM Bank, including the Offshore Branch for the purpose of operation of and dealing with the said bank account and Carry out other relevant and necessary transactions and generally to take all such steps and to do all such things as may be required from time to time on behalf of the Company.  h) He has admitted having signed the Pledge Agreement in furtherance of the authorization by the Board of Directors. He has not made any unlawful gain and has not sold shares even after price of the shares of the Company went high and rather, he had bought shares subsequently.______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of four entities in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd.  Page 12 of 32    Noticee No. 2:  a) He joined the company as a non-executive Independent Director with effect from February 10, 1996 based on the request made by Noticee No. 1 who was the Chairman & Managing Director of the company. He accepted the request in good faith so as to benefit the company out of legal knowledge and experience which he had gained over the years. He was never a Promoter nor was covered under the Promoter's group category.  b) He was never in charge of the day-to-day operations of the company and that he was never in control of the Management of the company and or any operations, affairs and activities of the company.   c) He had resigned on April 01, 2014. He has enclosed E Form DIR 12 in support of his resignation.  d) The Resolution in question was first adopted by the Board of Directors in their meeting held   on March 16, 2010. Noticee No. 1 approached him on April 20, 2010 and requested him to sign the said resolution just as \"Certified True Copy\" since a certified copy of the resolution was required to be submitted by the company to EURAM Bank.  When the said true copy of resolution was brought to him for his signature, it was already signed by Noticee No. 3,  Director and Noticee No. 4, Company Secretary. He therefore signed the said resolution - as a third signatory - believing in the requirement of the company.  e) He never participated in any roadshow or by other ways for GDR issue made by the company in the year 2010 and that after the certified copy of the resolution was giv", "Date": "2021-04-28", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Adjudication Order in respect of four entities in the matter of Kemrock Industries and Exports Ltd.

CCBPL submitted that it received consideration (total of Rs. 41,50,000) from transferee mentioned at Sr. No. 13 in Table-3 above after more than 18 months from the date of transfer of shares of GLLFL. However, CCBPL did not submit its bank account statement reflecting the payment received by it. Thus, its bank account statement of CCBPL was obtained from HDFC Bank. As per bank statement, CCBPL received partial amount of Rs. 35,71,800 (as compared to Rs. 41,50,000 mentioned in the DIS) from SCPL on 11/03/2015 i.e. after more than 18 months of transfer of shares to SCPL (Annexure 9 to SCN).  19.

Off-market dealings are required to conform to the conditions mentioned in Spot Delivery Contract provisions as mentioned at Section 2(i) of SCRA read with  Adjudication Order in respect of Corporate Commodity Brokers Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Golden Legand Leasing and Finance Ltd.     Page 9 of 17  Section 16 of SCRA read with SEBI Notification S.O. 184(E) dated March 01, 2000, and Section 13 and Section 18 of SCRA, in order to be valid.  21. As per the Spot Delivery Contract provisions mentioned at Section 2(i) of the SCRA, the transferees were required to make actual payment for the shares on the same day as the date of the receipt of shares or on the next day. However, it was observed from the Table-4 above that the transferees mentioned at Sr. Nos. 1-13 paid consideration to CCBPL much before or after the shares were actually transferred to them in their demat accounts. Thus, the dealings of the Noticee (transferor) and transferees allegedly did not conform to the provisions of Spot Delivery Contract as mentioned at Section 2(i) of the SCRA.   22. In view of the above, the Noticee and the entities at S. Nos. 1-13 in Table 4 were alleged to have violated Section 16 SCRA read with SEBI Notification S.O. 184(E) dated March 01, 2000, as well as Section 13 and Section 18 of SCRA read with Section 2(i) of SCRA.   23. The SCN was served upon the Noticee on 02.12.2020 by e-mail.    24. Vide reply dated 03.02.2021, the Noticee submitted the following:- (a) The Noticee Company is no more in existence and could not access mails as it is a struck-off Company. (b) Noticee has been struck-off from the Register and dissolved by the Registrar of Companies as per Section 560 (5) of the Companies Act, 1956 on 01.07.2015. Copy of the Notice of the RoC was attached with the reply. (c) SCN mentions that Mr. Dhaval Shethwala and Mr. Ravindra Shethwala are directors of  Noticee.  However, Mr. Dhaval Shethwala and Mr. Ravindra Shethwala have already resigned from Noticee company on May 30, 2012 i.e. very well before the investigation period and Mr. Hirenkumar Patel and Jigar Pravinkumar Shah were appointed as a director in the company with effect from May 25, 2012.  Adjudication Order in respect of Corporate Commodity Brokers Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Golden Legand Leasing and Finance Ltd.     Page 10 of 17  (d) SCN is issued after a gap of more than 8 years from the date of transaction in shares of GLLFL i.e. in the year 2013. However, the said SCN is silent on which basis the present proceeding is initiated after this many years. Hence, there is an inordinate delay in initiation of proceedings by SEBI. (e) Relevant documents i.e. Suspicious Transaction Reports should be provided to Noticee. (f) Noticee was allotted 335000 shares of GLLFL in preferential issue in 2011 and further received 335000 shares as bonus in 2012. (g) Noticee sold these 670000 shares to 12 different entities with whom Noticee had no relationship. The said shares were sold to these entities for consideration and the same is received in the bank of Noticee. (h) Noticee started to call consideration for the shares from all the buyer entities for immediate transfer of shares upon receipt of payment.  (i) Immediate transfer of shares even after receipt of consideration was not effected due to certain technical difficulty and objections from Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s share broker  M/s. Kunvarji Finstock Pvt .Ltd due to  change in directors of the Noticee. Noticee opened demat account with M/s. Kunvarji  Finstock  Pvt  Ltd  during  the  period  when  Mr. \\\\\\\\xb7Ravindra Shethwala was the director of the company and he was authorized to do transaction in the demat by board of directors of the company. (j) Even after resignation of Mr. Ravindra Shethwala from the directorship of the company, authorized signatory in the demat account was not updated due to inadvertent oversight mistake by new management. (k) After resignation of Mr. Ravindra Shethwala, he had no role in the affairs of the company and had not wanted to make any transaction in the company with his approval. However, after new management's fresh authority to operate the demat account of the company, he effected transfer of the shares to buyers account as instructed by the directors of the company. (l) Above technical difficulties in effecting transfer of shares to the buyers account caused delay in transfer of shares to buyers account.  Adjudication Order in respect of Corporate Commodity Brokers Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Golden Legand Leasing and Finance Ltd.     Page 11 of 17  (m)Further, sale of shares to M/s. Somar Commodities Pvt. Ltd. was made in the same terms as that of other buyers, and Noticee made transfer of remaining shares to M/s. Somar Commodities Pvt. Ltd. as the same needed to be done by authorized signatory Mr. Ravindra \\\\\\\\xb7Shethwala and Noticee did not want to disturb him more for transaction of the company in which he had already resigned. However due to financial difficulties M/s. Somar Commodities Pvt. Ltd. could not make payment as agreed. (n) All the shares of GLLFL is sold by CCBL for a sufficient consideration and not given as gift. In some of the DIS for off-market \\\\\\\\u201cGift\\\\\\\\u201d is mentioned as inadvertent mistake of clerical staff of Noticee and there was no malafide intention behind it.  (o) No complaint has been made against the Noticee for delay in effecting transfer of shares because of genuine technical difficulties understood by the buyers. Noticee has also borne with the financial difficulties faced by SCPL while making payment to CCBPL.  ( p )  None of the above transactions led to any price manipulation or market rigging  and there was not any wider market adverse impact of these transactions. There was no speculation transactions w h i c h  happened out of above transactions.  (q) With regard to consideration for shares sold to M/s. Somar Commodities  Pvt.  Ltd.  it was clarified that  out  of  total consideration  of  Rs. 41,50,000/-  Noticee received  15000  shares of GLLFL back from SCPL and the sum of Rs. 5,78,200/-  for 15000 shares of GLLFL is credited in to accounts of SCPL taking  market price of shares of GLLFL and balance  Rs. 35,71,800/-  received on 11/03/2015 after  repeated follow ups though after considering their financial difficulties.  25. Vide e-mail dated 22.02.2021 the Noticee was also provided with a copy of the Investigation Report as well as Suspicious Transaction Reports as requested by the Noticee.  Adjudication Order in respect of Corporate Commodity Brokers Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Golden Legand Leasing and Finance Ltd.     Page 12 of 17  26. Vide Hearing Notice dated 31.03.2021, the Noticee was provided an opportunity of hearing through videoconferencing on 10.03.2021.   27. During the hearing conducted through videoconferencing on 10.03.2021, the Authorised Representative (\\\\\\\\u201cAR\\\\\\\\u201d) of the Noticee submitted that the Noticee was voluntarily struck-off in 2015. Further, another opportunity of hearing was also sought during the hearing. However, the Noticee did not avail the second opportunity of hearing provided on 09.04.2021.   28. In the light of the allegations contained in the SCN, the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 submissions in respect of the allegations made in the SCN and relevant material available on record, I hereby proceed to decide the case on merits.    CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 29. The issues arising for consideration in the instant proceedings before me are:-  I. Whether the provisions of Section 16 of the SCRA read with SEBI Notification S.O. 184 (E) dated March 1, 2000, and Sections 13 and 18  read with Section 2 (i) of the SCRA have been violated by the Noticee? II. If yes, whether the Noticee is liable for imposition of monetary penalty under Section 23H of the SCRA? III. If yes, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticee taking into consideration the factors stipulated in Section 15 J of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 (2) of the Adjudication Rules?      I. Whether the provisions of Section 16 of the SCRA read with SEBI Notification S.O. 184 (E) dated March 1, 2000, and Sections 13 and 18  read with Section 2 (i) of the SCRA have been violated by the Noticee?  Adjudication Order in respect of Corporate Commodity Brokers Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Golden Legand Leasing and Finance Ltd.     Page 13 of 17  30. In the present case, the Noticee transferred 6,70,000 shares of GLLFL to 13 entities on 12.04.2013, 10.05.2013, 14.05.2013 and 15.05.2013 off-market, for a total consideration of Rs. 6121800. Entities at S. Nos. 1-4 of Table 4 paid the Noticee on 27.02.2013 but received shares from the Noticee on 12.04.2013. Thus, shares were transferred to the said entities by the Noticee after almost two months. Entities at S. Nos. 5-12 of Table 4 paid for shares of GLLFL on 22.02.2013, and received shares from the Noticee on 10.05.2013, after around two and a half months. SCPL (the entity at S. No. 13 of Table 4) received shares of GLLFL from the Noticee on 14.05.2013 and 15.05.2013 and paid for them on 11.03.2015, after more than eighteen months. Thus, as seller of shares of GLLFL in off-market mode, the Noticee has been in apparent breach of the stipulated time-frame of \\\\\\\\u201csame day as the date of contract or on the next day\\\\\\\\u201d specified for delivery of shares and payment of price in Section 2 (i) of the SCRA, in respect of the said off-market transactions.  31. The Noticee, in its reply, has attributed the delays in transfer of shares to procedural difficulties faced at the end of its broker due to a transitional phase where directors and authorised signatories for the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s demat accounts had changed. The Noticee has also sought to explain the delayed receipt of payment from SCPL as being on account of financial difficulties being faced by SCPL.    32. Further, the Noticee has informed that it was struck off the Register and dissolved by the Registrar of Companies as per Section 560 (5) of the Companies Act, 1956 on 01.07.2015. I have perused the copy of the Notice of the RoC submitted by the Noticee. The submission of the Noticee was also verified from the website of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs which shows that as on date, the Noticee is struck-off from the Register of Companies.   33. The Noticee has been struck off after following the procedure specified under the \\\\\\\\u2018Guidelines for Fast Track Exit mode for defunct companies under section 560 of  Adjudication Order in respect of Corporate Commodity Brokers Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Golden Legand Leasing and Finance Ltd.     Page 14 of 17  the Companies Act, 1956\\\\\\\\u2019 issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs vide Circular No. 36/2011, dated the 7th June, 2011which was applicable at the relevant time.  34. The applicable provisions of the abovementioned Circular are reproduced below for reference:-      \\\\\\\\u201cThere are a number of companies, which are registered under the Companies Act, 1956, but due to various reasons they are inoperative since incorporation or commenced business but became inoperative or defunct later on. Such companies may be desirous of getting their names strike off from the Register of Companies maintained by Registrar of Companies. 2. As per section 560 of the Companies Act, 1956, Registrar of Companies may strike off the name of companies on satisfying the conditions therein. As per present practice, a company desirous of getting its name struck off, has to apply to Registrar of companies in e-form 61. All pending statutory returns are required to be filed along with e-form 61. 3. In order to give an opportunity for fast track exit by a defunct company, for getting its name struck off from the register of companies, the Ministry has decided to modify the existing route through e-form \\\\\\\\u2013 61 and has prescribed the new Guidelines. The Guidelines for \\\\\\\\u201cFast Track Exit mode\\\\\\\\u201d for defunct companies under section 560 of the Companies Act, 1956 are enclosed herewith. 4. These Guidelines will be implemented w.e.f. 3rd July, 2011.\\\\\\\\u201d  \\\\\\\\u2018Guidelines for Fast Track Exit mode for defunct companies under section 560 of the Companies Act, 1956 1. For Fast Track Exit mode (FTE), it is stated as under:- (a) Any company will be called as \\\\\\\\u201cdefunct company\\\\\\\\u201d for the purpose of these guidelines, which has nil asset and liability and (i) has not commenced any business activity or operation since incorporation; or (ii) is not carrying over any business activity or operation for last one year before making application under FTE. (b) Any defunct company which has active status or identified as dormant by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, may apply for getting its name strike off from the Register of Companies; (c) Any defunct company which is a Government Company shall submit \\\\\\\\u2018No Objection Certificate\\\\\\\\u2019 issued by the concerned Administrative Ministry or Department or State Government along with the application; (d) the decision of the Registrar of Companies in respect of striking off the name of company shall be final.  Adjudication Order in respect of Corporate Commodity Brokers Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Golden Legand Leasing and Finance Ltd.     Page 15 of 17  \\\\\\\\u2026 2. Procedure to be adopted by Registrar of Companies in this matter:- (a) The Registrar of Companies, on receipt of the application, shall examine the same and if found in order, shall give a notice to the company under section 560(3) of the Companies Act, 1956 by email on its e-mail address intimated in the Form, giving thirty days time, stating that unless cause is shown to the contrary, its name be struck off from the Register and the company will be dissolved; (b) The Registrar of companies shall put the name of applicant(s) and date of making the application(s) under fast track exit mode, on daily basis, on the MCA portal http://www.mca.gov.in/, giving thirty days time for raising objection, if any, by the stakeholders to the concerned Registrar; (c) In case of company(s) like Non-Banking Financial Company(s), Collective Investment Management Company(s) which are regulated by other Regulator(s) namely RBI, SEBI, the Registrar of Companies, at the end of every week, shall send intimation of such companies availing fast track exit mode during that period to the concerned Regulator(s) and also an intimation in respect of all companies availing fast track exit mode during that period to the office of the Income Tax Department giving thirty days time for their objection, if any; (d) The Registrar of Companies immediately after passing of time given in sub-paras (a) to (c) of this Para and on being satisfied that the case is otherwise in order, shall strike its name off the Register and shall send notice under sub-section (5) of section 560 of the Companies Act, 1956 for publication in the Official Gazette and the applicant company shall stand dissolved from the date of publication of the notice in the Official Gazette.\\\\\\\\u201d  35. From the aforesaid, it is evident that the Noticee was struck-off from the RoC and stood dissolved before initiation of the instant proceedings for determining penalty in respect of the aforesaid allegations. In view of the fact that the Noticee was struck-off prior to initiation of proceedings in the current matter, it would not be appropriate to determine liability against a company which no longer exists as on date of current proceedings. Hence the proceedings stand abated without going into the merits of the case. Should the Noticee company be revived or restored at any stage, a decision to initiate proceedings may be taken afresh at that stage.   36. In this regard I place reliance on the decision of the ITAT in the matter of M/s. Anujay Hycare Products (P) Ltd. Vs The Income Tax Officer (ITAT Delhi) Date of Judgement/Order - 06/04/2018, Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, observed that  Adjudication Order in respect of Corporate Commodity Brokers Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Golden Legand Leasing and Finance Ltd.     Page 16 of 17  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. there could not have been any valid assessment order passed against the assessee-company which was not in existence as on the day of passing of the assessment order because it had already been dissolved. The assessment in the case of non-existing entity is thus nullity. Therefore, A.O. had no jurisdiction to pass the order against the non-existing company\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. However, as on today, it is an established fact that assessee-company has already been dissolved and its name is struck-off from the Registrar of Companies. Therefore, it is a non-existing Company and as such, A.O. cannot pass the assessment order under section 143(3) of the I.T. Act, 1961 against the assessee- company. The issue is, therefore, covered in favour of the assessee-company by the above judgments of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court, relied upon by the Learned Counsel for the Assessee.\\\\\\\\u201d  37. I further note that the SEBI Act in Section 28B states the following in respect of liability for penalty in the case of a death of a person:- \\\\\\\\u201cContinuance of proceedings.  28B. (1) Where a person dies, his legal representative shall be liable to pay any sum which the deceased would have been liable to pay, if he had not died, in the like manner and to the same extent as the deceased:  Provided that, in case of any penalty payable under this Act, a legal representative shall be liable only in case the penalty has been imposed before the death of the deceased person.\\\\\\\\u201d.    ORDER 38. In the light of the findings noted hereinabove, the adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee vide SCN dated December 2, 2020 are disposed of.

FACTS OF THE CASE  1. Based on certain preliminary findings in regard to the preferential allotment of shares in the scrip of Radford Global Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as RGL), Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as SEBI) passed two separate interim orders dated December 19, 2014 and November 09, 2015 in the matter. Thereafter, SEBI received reference from Principal Directors of Income Tax, Kolkata, Delhi and Chandigarh as well as from Financial Intelligence Unit. Based on these data, SEBI conducted investigation in the trading in the scrip of RGL for the period of February 27, 2012 to March 24, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as IP) to ascertain whether there were any violations of the provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as SEBI Act, 1992) and SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair    Page 2 of 13  Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as PFUTP Regulations, 2003) by certain entities. 2. On the basis of investigation conducted by SEBI for the transactions in the scrip of RGL, it was inter-alia alleged that Shelter Sales Agency Private Limited and Amrusha Mercantile Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as Noticees) violated the provisions of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a) & (e) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. Further, it was alleged that Shelter Sales Agency Pvt Ltd and Amrusha Mercantile Pvt Ltd violated provisions of Regulation 29(1) and 29(2) read with 29(3) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as SAST Regulations, 2011) and Regulations 13(1), and Regulation 13(13) read with 13(5) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as PIT Regulations, 1992).  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 3. The undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer, vide Order dated March 23, 2018 under Section 19 read with Section 15-I(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions of Section 15HA and Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, 1992 the alleged violations by the Noticees.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING:  4. A common show cause notice ref. SEBI/EAD/KS/MKG/31178/2018 dated November 02, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as SCN) was issued, inter-alia, to the Noticees, under the provisions of Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules, to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against them and why penalty, if any, should not be imposed under Section 15HA and 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, 1992 for alleged violations of the relevant provisions of law. 5. The common SCN was sent via SPAD to the Noticees. However, the said SPAD returned undelivered. Further, Noticees could not be served the SCN by    Page 3 of 13  affixture/ hand delivery. Therefore, the SCN was served on the Noticees vide publication on August 10, 2020. Further, Noticees were granted opportunity of personal hearing on October 05, 2020, vide publication on September 16, 2020. However, no communication was received for the Noticees as regards the SCN. 6. In view of the above, I am compelled to proceed in the matter against the Noticees ex parte. I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been complied with since sufficient opportunities have been provided to the Noticees to submit reply and to appear for hearing, which the Noticees have failed to avail of. Therefore, the present proceedings against the Noticees are undertaken ex-parte on the basis of available documents and information.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS: 7. I have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, and the material available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are: a.

Further analysis of these 1420 trades revealed that in 379 trades for 2,24,612 shares, the counterparties were Group Entities.

It was observed that the above mentioned Group entities (16 buyers and 8 sellers) carried out intra group trading in Patch 2 of the IP, and contributed Rs. 23.35 (7.77%) of market positive LTP. Therefore, it was alleged that the intragroup trading amongst the Group entities resulted in false and misleading appearance of trading in the scrip as well as contributed to price rise in the scrip during Patch 2. 15. Therefore, it was alleged that the intragroup trading in patch 2, by the Group Entities, including the Noticees, was with a manipulative intent to increase the share price of RGL. Thus, the Noticees were alleged to have violated sections 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a) & (e) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. 16.

______________________________________________________________________________ In respect of:  Aptech Limited (PA No. AADCA0602L) Aptech House,   A-65, MIDC, Marol, Andheri (E),  Mumbai - 400093.   1. Aptech Limited (hereinafter referred as \\\\\\\\u201cAptech\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cthe company\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticee\\\\\\\\u201d), is a company having its shares listed on BSE Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u2018BSE\\\\\\\\u2019) and National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u2018NSE\\\\\\\\u2019).

Pursuant to the investigation, SEBI made the following observations:  a) Aptech made an announcement / press release on September 07, 2016 at 17:48:00 hrs on BSE and at 17:30:00 hrs on NSE) i.e. after market hours with headline \\\\\\\\u201cAptech forays into preschool segment.\\\\\\\\u201d Considering the nature of the corporate announcement dated September 07, 2016 along with the impact of the same on the scrip price, the aforesaid announcement was considered by SEBI as Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (\\\\\\\\u201cUPSI\\\\\\\\u201d) as per Regulation 2(1)(n) (iv) of PIT Regulations which inter alia includes information relating to \\\\\\\\u201cexpansion of business\\\\\\\\u201d.  b) Vide letter dated July 24, 2017 and February 10, 2020, Aptech informed that it had initiated discussions with Montana International Pre-School Pvt. Ltd (\\\\\\\\u201cMontana\\\\\\\\u201d) on February 17, 2016. However, it was observed that non-disclosure agreement (which is the confidentiality agreement) between Aptech and Montana is dated March 14, 2016. SEBI felt that by entering into non-disclosure agreement on March 14, 2016, UPSI pertaining to \\\\\\\\u201cAptech forays into______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Aptech Limited   Page 2 of 12    preschool segment\\\\\\\\u201d came into existence on March 14, 2016 itself and thus, the period of UPSI was observed to be from March 14, 2016 to September 07, 2016.  c) SEBI advised Aptech to provide details of trading window closure, if any, with respect to the information related to press release dated September 07, 2016 vide SEBI letter dated January 29, 2020. In response to the said letter of SEBI, Aptech vide letter dated February 06, 2020, inter alia, stated that, \\\\\\\\u201cthe Press Release dated 7th September 2016 was not UPSI and accordingly there was no requirement of trading window closure prior to the said Press Release and hence the trading window was not closed\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d.  d) In view of the above and as confirmed by Aptech itself, it is alleged that Aptech failed to close the trading window in relation to the UPSI pertaining to the press release dated September 07, 2016 titled \\\\\\\\u201cAptech forays into preschool segment\\\\\\\\u201d and had thus, violated Clause 4 of the Minimum Standards for Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Insiders as specified in Schedule B read with Regulation 9(1) of PIT Regulations.  3. In support of the allegation, reliance was also placed on the responses received from BSE vide email dated December 10, 2019 and from NSE vide email dated December 06, 2019 and from Montana vide email dated February 10, 2020 and February 27, 2020.  4.

The SCN was sent at the last known address of the Noticee through Speed Post with Acknowledgment Due and the same was duly served.  7. In response to the SCN, vide letter dated February 19, 2021, the Noticee filed its reply and availed the opportunity of personal hearing granted to it through WebEx platform on March 09, 2021, when Mr. Ravichandra Hegde, Advocate, Authorized Representative (\\\\\\\\u2018AR\\\\\\\\u2019) of the Noticee appeared on its behalf and made oral submissions on the lines of written reply filed by the Noticee______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Aptech Limited   Page 4 of 12    vide letter dated February 19, 2021, and explained the contents thereof. Subsequently, the Noticee filed its post-hearing written submissions vide letter dated March 16, 2021. The replies/submissions of the Noticee are inter-alia as follows:  a) Aptech is engaged in the business of global education and training since 1986. Entire operations of Aptech were in the field of education which still continues even today. The collaboration with Montana was also in the field of education and was therefore an activity in the regular course of business. While collaborating with Montana, Aptech has remained in the same domain area of its operation and therefore SEBI's contention that the collaboration was \"expansion of business\" under Regulation 2(1)(n)(iv) of PIT Regulations is incorrect.  b) Since Aptech was leading provider of vocational education, as a step towards further diversification, venturing into pre-school education was considered a logical step. It had on earlier occasions did introduce a few school specific products in both domestic and overseas markets with limited success. The management of Aptech initially felt that they shall acquire a green field project to foray into pre-school education, however, after deliberation with various partners, as a first step, partnership with a small player viz., Montana was considered which had only ten (10) schools in and around Mumbai at relevant time.   c) It was considered appropriate to have a small enterprise to begin with rather than having a large establishment where the process of collaboration itself becomes complicated.  Thus, the foray into school segment was not entirely new to the Company and therefore the alliance with Montana was not material information warranting disclosure to the exchanges. Further, the likely turnover and profits, if any from the new alliance was likely to be insignificant in the overall context and was certainly not material. In fact, any collaboration in the field of education falls under 'operations undertaken in the regular course of business'.  d) As per Clause 4 of Schedule 8- Code of Conduct of PIT Regulations, a notional trading window shall be used as an instrument of monitoring trading by the designated persons. Considering there was no UPSI, there was no necessity for closing the trading window.  e) Aptech is engaged in collaborating with various entities and making press releases to that effect as a measure of good governance. If one observes various press releases/announcements by Aptech, it can be observed that many announcements made by the company pertained to collaborations/tie-ups/alliance, etc. The announcement with Montana was in line with and in consonance the other activities of the company made in ordinary course. There was nothing______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Aptech Limited   Page 5 of 12    novel about it so as to necessitate closure of trading window. An indicative list (13 in number) of press release/ announcements made by Aptech was provided.  f) It confirmed that all the instances of Press Releases mentioned in the said indicative list did not trigger the materiality threshold of the Code on Materiality formulated by the Noticee. Accordingly, in all instances mentioned in the said indicative list, the trading window was never closed. There were never any concerns raised either by the stock exchanges or SEBI at any point of time. The Code on Materiality being approved by the Board has always been in public domain and the Code still remains unchanged. The Noticee has merely followed the Code which did not warrant any trading window closure as the very transaction underlying the Press Release was not material.  g) If such operations undertaken in the normal course of business are considered as UPSI, the listed entity would be expected to close its trading window all throughout the year, which clearly is not the intent of the PIT Regulations and which would also give an unwanted speculation into the minds of employees. The listed entity may consider it unwise to shut the trading window for all designated persons on a blanket basis since it would lead to all designated persons getting to sense that something is afoot, which would violate the principle underlying Regulation 3, which mandates a need-to- know doctrine in how the PIT Regulations are administered and information is handled in any organization.  h) In terms of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirement) Regulations, 2015 (\"LODR Regulations\"), the Board of Directors of Aptech have framed a 'Policy on Determination of Materiality of Events and Information for Disclosure to the Stock Exchanges' (\"Materiality Policy\").  As per the said  Materiality Policy,  the events/information relating  to change  in  the general character  or nature of business or business brought about by arrangements for strategic, technical, manufacturing or marketing tie up or adoption  of new lines of business or closure of operation  of any unit/division (entirely  or piecemeal) will be disclosed  to stock exchange within twenty-four (24) hours if the impact of such event or information on the company  exceeds  10% of  its  turnover/net-worth  whichever  is  higher   based  on  the  latest  audited   accounts.   The collaboration with Montana was not considered to have any such impact and does not fall into the materiality policy of the Company and therefore to consider the same as UPSI warranting closure of trading window is erroneous.  i) It is pertinent to note that only two out of three director signatories of Montana signed the said Agreement. Mr.  Suresh Madhavan of Montana could not sign.  In the meanwhile, on May 19,______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Aptech Limited   Page 6 of 12    2016, Mr. Anuj  Kacker  (authorized signatory  of Aptech)  emailed  Montana  to keep the Agreement on hold as there was change  in the Managing Director/ top management. Thus, there were many piecemeal discussions with respect to the collaboration with Montana. The Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (\"SAT\") has ruled that such uncertain information cannot be the basis of alleging UPSI (ref Samir Arora's case and Reliance Petro Investment's case).  j) In 2016, Montana was very small entity having only ten (10) pre-schools in entire country.  The paid-up capital of Montana was a meagre amount of Rs. One lakh and turnover for FY 2014-15 was Rs. 44 lakhs with a loss of Rs 76 lakhs. Hence, with such financials, there was no question of breaching the threshold to trigger any disclosure under the Materiality Code. The arrangement with Montana for operating pre-schools cannot be considered material under the Regulations 30 read with Schedule III of the LODR Regulations, is therefore not a material contract.  k) Aptech did not make any investment in Montana at time of execution of Agreement. In fact, the bulk of the investment was to be borne by the franchisees under the alliance and therefore major share of the collection by the center was to go to the franchisees (and not Aptech).  l) Though, some of the media articles had reported that the target was to achieve Rs. 25 Crores and Rs.60 Crores in two years respectively, the same was only an indicative figure of the alliance as whole (and not Aptech's additional income). The said figure of Rs. 25 Crores and Rs.60 Crores meant Gross Systemwide Collection of fees from the students which were projected to be shared between the franchisees, Alliance Partner (Montana) and Aptech.  m) If one observes that the price movement in the scrip, it is evidently clear that there has been a steady and consistent rise in the price. This may be due to various factors including investor presentation (on August 2, 2016), formulation of ESOP Scheme (on August 19, 2016), etc. The Press Release, therefore, cannot be considered the basis for any increase in price of the scrip as contended.  n) Further, the price rise on September 7, 2016 (when Press Release was issued) is not something contrary to normal price movement in the share of Aptech.  The SCN merely considers the price of next day (i.e. September 8, 20 16) to conclude that the collaboration was price sensitive in nature whilst ignoring the consistent upward movement for over a month.  In hindsight, one can also observe that instead of being positive, the said collaboration was not even fruitful.______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Aptech Limited   Page 7 of 12    There was loss of Rs. 40 lakhs in FY 2016-17 and Rs. 2.11 Crores in FY 2017-18 from the said vertical.  o) The obligation to close the trading window arises only when the information is material. It is an undisputed fact that the information with respect to collaboration was made in the regular course of business and was not material.  In the Gujarat NRE Mineral Resource Ltd case, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT ruled that every activity in the normal and ordinary course of business is not a price sensitive information.  p) Aptech has closed the trading window in all other instances when the law specifically required the Noticee to do so. In all such instances where there was no discretion on the closure of trading window, it could not have taken any other view and have rightly closed the trading window. Such instances are those where the PIT Regulations and the LODR Regulations makes it mandatory for considering the event as material and accordingly close the trading window. Therefore, it has been conscious in the approach relating to trading window closure, and acted strictly as per the regulatory scope, it would be incorrect on the part of SEBI to sit in judgment over the decisions taken by the company when admittedly those actions were as per the Code on Materiality which too again is framed as specifically mandated under the PIT Regulations.  q) What is relevant to note that the closure a trading window is an additional tool granted to ensure that no insider trades on the basis of any UPSI. Even when the listed entity decides to not utilize this discretionary tool to monitor trading, there  are  other mandatory tools such as the requirement of taking  pre-clearance to ensure that intent of the PIT Regulations is followed. In the case of Hindustan Dorr Oliver Ltd. and Ors v. SEBI, (Appeal No. 107 of 2011), the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT has held that the definition of price sensitive information for the purpose of closing the trading window by the company under its code of conduct is much narrower than the definition of price sensitive information as given in PIT Regulation.  r) Another Show Cause Notice was issued to the directors of Aptech for trading in shares of the Company during the relevant period. The said entities have opted for settlement of the proceedings under the SEBI (Settlement Proceedings) Regulations, 2018 and filed revised consent terms with the Internal Committee of SEBI. Thus, the regulatory objectives have been met and therefore imposing a monetary penalty on the Company is unwarranted. In the case of Piramal Enterprise Limited (Appeal No. 466 of 2017), the Hon'ble SAT while taking cognizance of the fact that the entities who had allegedly infracted has settled the case with SEBI ruled that imposition of monetary penalty was unwarranted.______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Aptech Limited   Page 8 of 12     8. I have considered the allegations and charges levelled against the Noticee, submissions of the Noticee and the relevant material available on record. The limited question for determination in the instant proceedings is whether the Noticee failed to close the trading window in relation to the UPSI pertaining to the press release dated September 07, 2016 titled \\\\\\\\u201cAptech forays into preschool segment\\\\\\\\u201d as alleged and violated the provisions of Clause 4 of the Minimum Standards for Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Insiders as specified in Schedule B read with Regulation 9(1) of PIT Regulations. As per Regulation 9 (1) of the PIT Regulations, the onus lies on the board of directors of every listed company to formulate a code of conduct to govern, regulate, monitor and report trading by its employees and other connected persons towards achieving compliance with PIT Regulations, adopting the minimum standards as set out in Schedule B to the PIT Regulations. The Note to Regulation 9 (1) of the PIT Regulations clearly spelts out the intention behind framing of the said provision. It mandates every listed company to formulate a code of conduct governing trading by its employees without diluting the provisions of PIT Regulations in any manner. The minimum standards as set out in Schedule B to the PIT Regulations standards are required to be addressed by such code of conduct. Clause 4 of Code of Conduct under Schedule B to the PIT Regulations mandates that a notional trading window shall be used by the listed company as an instrument of monitoring trading by the designated persons. Further, it envisages that the trading window shall be closed when the compliance officer of the listed company determines that a designated person or class of designated persons can reasonably be expected to have possession of UPSI. Such closure shall be imposed in relation to such securities to which such UPSI relates and that the designated persons and their immediate relatives shall not trade in such securities when the trading window is closed. The charges in this case clearly falls under the abovementioned provisions of PIT Regulations as the Noticee is a listed company which is mandated to formulate a code of conduct governing trading by its employees without diluting the provisions of PIT Regulations in any manner and effectively use the notional trading window as an instrument for monitoring trading by the designated persons.  9. In this case, the Noticee made an announcement / press release on September 07, 2016, with headline \\\\\\\\u201cAptech forays into preschool segment.\\\\\\\\u201d Considering the nature of the corporate announcement dated September 07, 2016 along with the impact of the same on the scrip price, the aforesaid announcement was considered as UPSI as per Regulation 2(1)(n) (iv) of PIT Regulations which inter alia includes information relating to \\\\\\\\u201cexpansion of business\\\\\\\\u201d. It is noted that the non-disclosure agreement (which is the confidentiality agreement) was entered into by the Noticee with Montana on March 14, 2016. The observation made by SEBI is that by entering into non-disclosure______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Aptech Limited   Page 9 of 12    agreement on March 14, 2016, UPSI pertaining to \\\\\\\\u201cAptech forays into preschool segment\\\\\\\\u201d came into existence on March 14, 2016 itself and thus, the period of UPSI was observed to be from March 14, 2016 to September 07, 2016. It is an admitted position that the Noticee had not closed the trading window from March 14, 2016 to September 07, 2016 i.e. during the alleged UPSI period and there is no dispute on this count. The Noticee has contended that it has remained in the same domain area of its operation and therefore SEBI's contention that the collaboration was \"expansion of business\" under Regulation 2(1)(n)(iv) of PIT Regulations is incorrect.  In this regard, from the submissions of the Noticee, I note that the management of Aptech envisaged acquiring a green field project to foray into pre-school education, but later on tied a partnership with Montana which had ten schools in and around Mumbai at the relevant time to foray into pre-school business. Such partnership with Montana is undoubtedly venturing into or expanding the business of the company which was already into providing vocational education. I note that Regulation 2(1)(n) of the PIT Regulations stipulates that UPSI means any information, relating to a company or its securities, directly or indirectly, that is not generally available which upon becoming generally available, is likely to materially affect the price of the securities and shall, ordinarily including but not restricted to, information relating to the following: \\\\\\\\u2013 (i.) financial results; (ii.) dividends; (iii.) change in capital structure; (iv.) mergers, de-mergers, acquisitions, delistings, disposals and expansion of business and such other transactions; (v.) changes in key managerial personnel; and (vi.) material events in accordance with the listing agreement.  10. From the above, I note that Regulation 2(1)(n) of the PIT Regulations specifies the above mentioned six events / information as UPSIs to be observed by any listed company. These six events are bare minimum information to be observed by the listed company as UPSI. The list is inclusive and not exhaustive. From the website of the Noticee, the Code of Conduct for prevention of insider trading was perused. Upon perusal, it is observed that clause 1.23 of the Code of Conduct of the Noticee clearly specifies that \\\\\\\\u201cexpansion of business\\\\\\\\u201d as one of the event which is to observed by it as UPSI. I note that Regulation 9 (1) of the PIT Regulations mandates every listed company, including the Noticee, to formulate a code of conduct without diluting the provisions of PIT Regulations in any manner. Therefore, the language of regulation 9 (1) )of the PIT Regulations is  a  direct  command  to  the listed company to  comply  with  this requirement without any______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Aptech Limited   Page 10 of 12    exemption or relaxation. I, therefore, do find any merit in the contention of the Noticee in this regard.  11. The Noticee further contended that the collaboration with Montana does not fall into the materiality policy of the Company framed in terms of LODR Regulations and therefore to consider the same as UPSI warranting closure of trading window is erroneous. It is noted that as per the materiality policy of the Noticee, disclosure is required to be made to stock exchange only if the impact of any transaction is to the tune of 10% of the turnover/net worth, whichever is higher. I note that Regulation 2(1)(n)(vi) of the PIT Regulations specifies that \\\\\\\\u201cmaterial events in accordance with the listing agreement\\\\\\\\u201d as one of the event which is to be observed by the listed company as UPSI. However, clause 1.23 of the Code of Conduct of the Noticee does not include \\\\\\\\u201cmaterial events in accordance with the listing agreement\\\\\\\\u201d as an event to be observed by it as UPSI. Thus, the Noticee has not considered one out of six bare minimum events to be observed by it as UPSI. From the submissions of the Noticee, I note that it has apparently mixed its materiality policy framed in terms of LODR Regulations with the requirements stipulated under PIT Regulations. It is relevant to mention that the requirements under LODR Regulations and PIT Regulations are independent of each other, except the clause (vi) of Regulation 2(1)(n) of the PIT Regulations which refers to material events in accordance with the listing agreement. Further, the provision of PIT Regulations which is invoked is Regulation 2(1)(n)(iv) and not Regulation 2(1)(n)(vi). In view of the said facts, the contention of the Noticee in this regard is devoid of any merit.   12. From the Code of Conduct for prevention of insider trading as available in the website of the Noticee, it is further noted that clause 7.1 deals with UPSI during which the Trading Window shall be closed. It lists out eight events and the item (d) out of such eight events mentions about \\\\\\\\u201cAnnouncement of any major expansion plans or launching of any major project\\\\\\\\u201d.  Thus, it is obvious that as per the code of conduct of the Noticee, the trading window has to be closed when any expansion project is launched. Resultantly, the trading window ought to be closed when the Noticee has concrete plans to venture / foray into pre-school education business.   13. The Noticee on one hand claims that collaboration with Montana was made in the regular course of business and was not material and on the other hand, submits that another Show Cause Notice was issued to the directors of Aptech for trading in shares of the Company during the relevant period and that the said entities have opted for settlement of the proceedings under the SEBI (Settlement Proceedings) Regulations, 2018 and filed revised consent terms with the Internal Committee of SEBI. The arguments put forth by the Noticee are in sharp contradiction to each______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Aptech Limited   Page 11 of 12    other. The said fact establishes that the Noticee has failed to effectively use the notional trading window as an instrument for monitoring trading by the designated persons. Therefore, in my view, other submissions made by the Noticee does not deserve further consideration as the failure of the Noticee as found in this case stands established and hence, deserves imposition of monetary penalty under section 15HB of the SEBI Act for the violation of the provisions of Clause 4 of Code of Conduct under Schedule B of Regulation 9(1) of the PIT Regulations read with Regulation 2(1)(n)(iv) of the PIT Regulations.   14. While determining the quantum of penalty, it is important to consider the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which are as under:  a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c) the repetitive nature of the default.  15. Having regard to the factors listed in section 15J and the guidelines issued by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in SEBI Vs Bhavesh Pabari Civil Appeal No(S).11311 of 2013 vide judgement dated February 28, 2019, it is noted from the material available on record, i.e. details of investigation, that designated persons and their immediate relatives, totaling 11 in number, have made wrongful gain of \\\\\\\\u20b9 12.68 Crores (approx..) by trading in the scrip of the Noticee during the period when the trading window ought to have been closed by the Noticee. I note that had the Noticee effectively used the trading window mechanism as an instrument for preventing insider trading by the designated persons and their immediate relatives who are \\\\\\\\u2018insiders\\\\\\\\u2019, such wrongful gain made by them could have been averted. Thus, the extent of loss suffered by the investors as a result of the default in this case can be assessed to the tune of \\\\\\\\u20b9 12.68 Crores (approx..) which is equivalent to the wrongful gain made by the insiders. The said amount of wrongful gain made by the insiders is definitely significant. I note that SEBI had issued Show Cause Notice under section 11B of the SEBI Act to such insiders calling upon them to show cause as to why such wrongful gains made should not be disgorged and the same is pending for final determination. The non-serious and casual approach on the part of the Noticee towards compliance with the PIT Regulations as found in this case is unbecoming a conduct of a listed company which has aided and contributed to the commission of Insider Trading violation which is the most heinous violation in the securities market. In view of the same, I am of the view that non-adherence to the laid down obligations under the PIT Regulations by the Noticee, being a listed company, as observed in this case, should be dealt with by imposing a deterrent monetary penalty so as to serve as an effective message.______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Aptech Limited   Page 12 of 12     16.

FACTS OF THE CASE  1. Based on certain preliminary findings in regard to the preferential allotment of shares in the scrip of Radford Global Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as RGL), Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as SEBI) passed two separate interim orders dated December 19, 2014 and November 09, 2015 in the matter. Thereafter, SEBI received reference from Principal Directors of Income Tax, Kolkata, Delhi and Chandigarh as well as from Financial Intelligence Unit. Based on these data, SEBI conducted investigation in the trading in the scrip of RGL for the period of February 27, 2012 to March 24, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as IP) to ascertain whether there were any violations of the provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as SEBI Act, 1992) and SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair    Page 2 of 10  Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as PFUTP Regulations, 2003) by certain entities. 2. On the basis of investigation conducted by SEBI for the transactions in the scrip of RGL, it was inter-alia alleged that Devakantha Trading Private Limited and Udbal Mercantile Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as Noticees) violated the provisions of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a) & (e) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003.   APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 3. The undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer, vide Order dated March 23, 2018 under Section 19 read with Section 15-I(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions of Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 the alleged violations by the Noticees.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING:  4. A common show cause notice ref. SEBI/EAD/KS/MKG/31178/2018 dated November 02, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as SCN) was issued, inter-alia, to the Noticees, under the provisions of Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules, to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against them and why penalty, if any, should not be imposed under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 for alleged violations of the relevant provisions of law. 5. The details of delivery of SCNs and further communication with Noticees are as follows: (i) Udbal Mercantile Pvt Ltd- The common SCN was sent via SPAD to the Noticee. However, the said SPAD returned undelivered. Therefore, the SCN was served on the Noticee by affixture on December 23, 2018, and vide publication on August 10, 2020. Further, Noticee was granted opportunity of personal hearing on October 05, 2020, vide publication on September 16,    Page 3 of 10  2020. However, no communication was received for the Noticee as regards the SCN. (ii) Devakantha Ptrading Pvt Ltd- The common SCN was delivered via SPAD to the Noticee as per the records. However, no communication was received from the Noticee as regards the SCN. 6. In view of the above, I am compelled to proceed in the matter against the Noticees ex parte. I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been complied with since sufficient opportunities have been provided to the Noticees to submit reply and to appear for hearing, which the Noticees have failed to avail of. Therefore, the present proceedings against the Noticees are undertaken ex-parte on the basis of available documents and information.   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS: 7. I have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, and the material available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are: a. Whether the Noticees, by their trades, have resulted in false and misleading appearance of trading as well as contributed to the price in the scrip of RGL (during patch 2) and, therefore, have violated the provisions of Section 12A(a), (b), and (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), and (d) and 4(1), (2) (a) and (e) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003?  b. If yes, whether the Noticees are liable for penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992? c. If yes, what should be the quantum of penalty that should be imposed on the Noticee(s)? 8.

As brought out in the above table, it was observed that 16 Group Entities contributed Rs.74.85 to net LTP and Rs.116 of positive LTP (i.e. 38.56% of the total market positive LTP) in 1420 trades for 11,83,458 shares. Further analysis of these 1420 trades revealed that in 379 trades for 2,24,612 shares, the counterparties were Group Entities. I note that trading among Group Entities contributed Rs. 23.35 to positive LTP which is 7.77% of total market LTP. The details pertaining to positive LTP contribution by Group Entities as sellers are given below: Buyer Name Sr. No. Noticee no. Seller LTP > 0 Qty.

It was observed that the above mentioned Group entities (16 buyers and 8 sellers) carried out intra group trading in Patch 2 of the IP, and contributed Rs. 23.35 (7.77%) of market positive LTP. Therefore, it was alleged that the intragroup trading amongst the Group entities resulted in false and misleading appearance of trading in the scrip as well as contributed to price rise in the scrip during Patch 2.    Page 9 of 10  15. Therefore, it was alleged that the intragroup trading in patch 2, by the Group Entities, including the Noticees, was with a manipulative intent to increase the share price of RGL. Thus, the Noticees were alleged to have violated sections 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a) & (e) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. 16. I note from the website of Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) that the status of the Noticees is being shown as \\\\\\\\u201cStrike Off\\\\\\\\u201d. In this regard, copies of the Company Master data of the Noticees from the MCA website are placed in the file. Since the status of the Noticees is showing as \\\\\\\\u201cStrike Off\\\\\\\\u201d, it is imperative to see whether the Noticees are existing or not.  17. On perusal of the various \\\\\\\\u2018Form No. STK-7, Notice of Striking Off and Dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019, as available on the MCA website, I note that Registrar of Companies, Maharashtra has declared pursuant to Section 248(5) of the Companies Act, 2013, that the Noticee companies have been struck off the Register of Companies, through various notices. The details in this regard are as follows: Name of the Noticee Date of the \\\\\\\\u2018Form No. STK-7, Notice of Striking Off and Dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 Date of dissolution as per the Notice Udbal Mercantile Pvt Ltd August 18, 2017 August 11, 2017 Devakantha Trading Pvt Ltd July 10, 2017 June 16, 2017 18. It is noted from the records that the present adjudication proceedings were approved on September 01, 2017 and the AO was appointed on September 04, 2017, pursuant to which it was contemplated by SEBI to issue settlement notices to various entities in the matter.  Subsequently, in March 2018, the matter was referred for adjudication proceedings. I note that the Noticees were struck off the    Page 10 of 10  register of companies and dissolved even before the matter was referred for adjudication proceedings. 19. Since the Noticees have been \\\\\\\\u201cdissolved\\\\\\\\u201d, in the facts and circumstances of the instant case, I conclude that the adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticees vide SCN dated November 02, 2018 cannot be proceeded with. ORDER 20. In view of my findings noted in the preceding paragraphs and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against Noticees viz.

In this regard, it is observed that one Pan Asia Advisors Ltd (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Pan Asia\\\\\\\\u2019) was the Book Running Lead Manager for both of these said GDR issues of CAT. Further, it was also observed that one Mr. Arun Panchariya (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018AP\\\\\\\\u2019) was the founder, director as well as 100% shareholder of Pan Asia.

It is further alleged that AP was Managing Director, 100% shareholder and Authorized Signatory of Vintage. Thereafter, using certain Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), AP got the GDRs converted into underlying shares and sold them in the Indian securities market with the help of certain domestic entities connected to him.  2.

Further, it was observed that CAT had transferred funds to Noticee 3 and Shri Laxmi Pershad Jaiswal, however it had not disclosed the same to be related party transactions in its annual report for FY 2008-09, and accordingly CAT was alleged to have violated clause 32 of the Listing Agreement. Further, it was observed that in its annual report for FY 2008-09 and 2009-10, CAT has merely mentioned that related party transactions have occurred between CAT and Noticee 7 without providing the details regarding the nature of transactions and volume of the transactions, and thus, CAT was alleged to have violated Clause 32 of the Listing Agreement.Page 4 of 139 3.

It is alleged that the Loan and Pledge Agreement for its first GDR issue and second GDR Issue were signed among CAT, Vintage and Euram. The same is discussed in detail below:- ISSUE 2 (in 2009) e. It is observed that a loan agreement (Loan Agreement No. K271009-002) dated October 27,2009 was signed between Euram and Vintage. The agreement was signed by Arun Panchariya (hereinafter referred to as AP) as Managing Director on behalf of Vintage. The Loan agreement states that Euram has agreed to make available a loan of USD 1,00,02,737.91 to Vintage (referred to as ''the Borrower''). The nature and purpose of the loan facility is to provide funding enabling Vintage to take down GDR issue of CAT and may only be transferred to Euram account no: 540013 for CAT. The following is stated in the Loan Agreement;Page 7 of 139 \"6.1 In order to secure all and any of the Bank's claims and entitlements against the Borrower, arising now or in the future out of or in connection with the Loan or any other obligation or liability of the Borrower to the Bank, including without limitation other loans granted in the future , it is hereby irrevocably agreed that the following securities and any other securities which may be required by the Bank from time to time shall be given to the Bank as provided herein or in any other form or manner as may be demanded by the Bank \\\\\\\\u2022 Pledge of certain securities held from time to time in the Borrower's account no. 540 013 at the Bank as set out in a separate pledge agreement which is attached hereto as Annex 2 and which forms an integral part of this Loan Agreement. \\\\\\\\u2022 Pledge of the account no. 540 013 of the Borrower held with the Bank as set out in a separate pledge agreement which is attached hereto as Annex 2 and which forms an integral part of this Loan Agreement.\" f. Further, a Pledge Agreement dated October 27, 2009 is also signed between CAT and Euram Bank. The agreement was signed by Noticee 2 on behalf of CAT as Managing Director of CAT. He and his other family members are promoters of CAT. The following  Resolution was passed by the Board of Directors of CAT at its meeting dated April 30, 2007 and August 28, 2009:- \\\\\\\\u201cRESOLVED THAT a bank account be opened with EURAM BANK (\"the Bank\") or any branch of EURAM BANK, including the Offshore Branch, outside India for the purpose of receiving subscription money in respect of the Global Depository Receipt issue of the Company.

According to the Pledge Agreement, CAT has been referred as \"Pledgor'' and Euram has been referred to as ''Bank''. The preamble of the Pledge Agreement states \"By loan agreement K271009-002(hereinafter referred to as ''Loan Agreement'') dated October 27,2009, the Bank granted a loan (hereinafter referred to as the ''Loan'') to Vintage FZE, AAH-213, Al Ahamadi House, Jebel Ali Free Trade Zone, Jebel Ali, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (''the Borrower\") in the amount of $ USD 1,00,02,737.91. The Pledgor has received a copy of the Loan Agreement and acknowledges and agrees to its terms and conditions.\\\\\\\\u201d h. From the above preamble of Pledge Agreement, it is clear that Noticee-2 and CAT were also the party to the Loan Agreement. Further, the pledge created in the Pledge Agreement is stated below:-  \" 2. Pledge 2.1 In order to secure any and all obligations, Present and future, whether conditional or unconditional of the Borrower towards the bank under the Loan Agreement and any and all respective amendments thereto and for any and all other current or future claims which the Bank may have against the Borrower in connection with the Loan Agreement \\\\\\\\u2013 including those limited as to condition or time or not yet due \\\\\\\\u2013 irrespective of whether such claims have originated from  the account relationship, from bills of exchange, guarantees and liabilitiesPage 9 of 139 assumed by the Borrower or by the Bank, or have otherwise resulted from business relations, or have been assigned in connection therewith to the Bank (\\\\\\\\u201cthe Obligations\\\\\\\\u201d) the Pledgor hereby pledges to the Bank the following assets as collateral to the Bank: 2.1.1 all of its rights, title and interest in and to the securities deposited from time to time at present or hereafter (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPledged Securities\\\\\\\\u201d) and the balance of funds up to the amount of $ USD 1,00,02,737.91 existing from time to time at present or hereafter on the securities account(s) no. 540 013 held with the Bank (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPledged Securities Account\\\\\\\\u201d) and all amounts credited at any particular time therein. 2.1.2 all of its right, title and interest in and to, and the balance of funds existing from time to time at present or hereafter on the account(s) no. 540 013 kept by the Bank (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPledged Time Deposit Account \\\\\\\\u201c) and all amounts credited at any particular time therein. The interest rate on deposit in the amount of the facility amount of the loan will be fixed at 2.5% p.a (the Pledged securities account and the Pledged Time Deposit account hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPledged Accounts\\\\\\\\u201d, the Pledged Securities and the Pledged Accounts hereinafter collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cCollateral\\\\\\\\u201d)   2.2 The Pledgor agrees to deposit with the Bank all dividends, interest and other  payments, distributions of cash or other property resulting from the Pledged Securities and funds i. Further, following condition have been put in the Pledge agreement for the realization of the pledge. ''6. Realization of the Pledge  6.1 In the case that the Borrower fails to make payment on any due amount, or default in accordance with the Loan Agreement, The Pledgor herewith grants its express consent and the Bank is entitled to apply the funds in the Pledged AccountsPage 10 of 139 to settle the Obligations. In such case the Bank shall transfer the funds on the Pledged Accounts, even repeatedly, to an account specified by the Bank  6.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case that the Borrower fails to make  payment on any due amount, or defaults in providing or increasing security, the Pledgor herewith grants its express consent and the Bank is entitled to realize the  Pledged Securities (i) at a public auction for those items of Pledged Securities for which no market price is quoted or which are not listed on a recognized stock exchange or (ii) in a private sale pursuant to the provisions of Section 376 Austrian Commercial Code unless the Bank decides to exercise its rights through court proceedings. The Pledgor and the Bank agree to Realize those items of the Pledged Securities for which a market price is quoted or which are listed on a stock exchange through sale by a Broker Publicly authorized for such transactions, selected by the Bank.  6.3 The Bank may realize the Pledge rather than accepting payments from the  Borrower after maturity of the claim if the Bank has reason to believe that the  Borrower\\\\\\\\u2019s payments may be contestable. '' j. It is noted that the bank account no. 540013 is the account which CAT has maintained with Euram Bank to keep the proceeds of GDRs, thus it is alleged that CAT has pledged money received through issuance of GDRs to secure rights of Euram Bank against the loan given by Euram Bank to Vintage for subscription of GDR issue (as mentioned in Loan agreement of Vintage).This account (540013) is also mentioned as the borrower in the Loan Agreement. It is alleged that the common ownership of a bank account which belongs to both the borrower/subscriber and the Issuer Company in which the GDR proceeds are received added to a guarantee by Issuer Company for the loan taken by subscriber to its GDRs, are the central and determining features of this scheme to fraudulently raise capital by the Issuer Company. It is alleged that these agreements enabled Vintage to avail the loan from Euram Bank for subscribing GDRs of CAT andPage 11 of 139 the GDR issue would not have been subscribed had CAT not given such security towards the loan taken by Vintage. It is also alleged that the Noticees did not inform Bombay Stock Exchange or shareholders of the company about signing the Pledge Agreement and Loan Agreement. ISSUE 1 (in 2007)  k. It is observed that a Loan agreement was also signed between Vintage and Euram bank previously on July 23, 2007 in relation to first GDR issue of CAT. Similarly, a Pledge Agreement was signed between CAT and Euram on July 20, 2007. The Loan agreement and Pledge Agreement signed 1st time were exactly similar to the 2nd Loan Agreement and Pledge Agreement except following differences: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The loan agreement mentions the name of Kohinoor Broadcasting Corporation Ltd's (Kohinoor) as the issuer company for which the loan is provided. The nature and purpose of the Loan Agreement states that, \" to provide funding enabling Vintage to take down GDR issue of Kohinoor Broadcasting Corporation Ltd's (Kohinoor) Luxemburg public offering and may only be transferred to Euram account no: 540013 for CAT Technologies Ltd...'' \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Thus the Loan and Pledge Agreement were signed for the subscription of 1st GDR issue of 43,04,348 GDRs of CAT Technologies Ltd which closed on July 27, 2007 but mentioned the name of Kohinoor, presumably due to a typographical error. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The Loan amount was USD 64,56,522.00, as was the size of GDR issue. Acquisition, Cancellation and Sale of GDRs:- l. It is noted that pursuant to the issuance of GDRs, Vintage became the sole holder of the GDRs issued, thereby becoming the majority share holder of CAT. These GDRs were transferred to FIIs mostly through over the counter transactions. The following table gives the detail of transfer of GDRs of CAT to the FIIs in 1st GDR Issue.

FACTS OF THE CASE  1. Based on certain preliminary findings in regard to the preferential allotment of shares in the scrip of Radford Global Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as RGL), Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as SEBI) passed two separate interim orders dated December 19, 2014 and November 09, 2015 in the matter. Thereafter, SEBI received reference from Principal Directors of Income Tax, Kolkata, Delhi and Chandigarh as well as from Financial Intelligence Unit. Based on these data, SEBI conducted investigation in the trading in the scrip of RGL for the period of February 27, 2012 to March 24, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as IP) to ascertain whether there were any violations of the provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as SEBI Act, 1992) and SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair    Page 2 of 10  Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as PFUTP Regulations, 2003) by certain entities. 2. On the basis of investigation conducted by SEBI for the transactions in the scrip of RGL, it was inter-alia alleged that Devakantha Trading Private Limited and Udbal Mercantile Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as Noticees) violated the provisions of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a) & (e) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003.   APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 3. The undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer, vide Order dated March 23, 2018 under Section 19 read with Section 15-I(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions of Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 the alleged violations by the Noticees.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING:  4. A common show cause notice ref. SEBI/EAD/KS/MKG/31178/2018 dated November 02, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as SCN) was issued, inter-alia, to the Noticees, under the provisions of Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules, to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against them and why penalty, if any, should not be imposed under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 for alleged violations of the relevant provisions of law. 5. The details of delivery of SCNs and further communication with Noticees are as follows: (i) Udbal Mercantile Pvt Ltd- The common SCN was sent via SPAD to the Noticee. However, the said SPAD returned undelivered. Therefore, the SCN was served on the Noticee by affixture on December 23, 2018, and vide publication on August 10, 2020. Further, Noticee was granted opportunity of personal hearing on October 05, 2020, vide publication on September 16,    Page 3 of 10  2020. However, no communication was received for the Noticee as regards the SCN. (ii) Devakantha Ptrading Pvt Ltd- The common SCN was delivered via SPAD to the Noticee as per the records. However, no communication was received from the Noticee as regards the SCN. 6. In view of the above, I am compelled to proceed in the matter against the Noticees ex parte. I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been complied with since sufficient opportunities have been provided to the Noticees to submit reply and to appear for hearing, which the Noticees have failed to avail of. Therefore, the present proceedings against the Noticees are undertaken ex-parte on the basis of available documents and information.   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS: 7. I have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, and the material available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are: a. Whether the Noticees, by their trades, have resulted in false and misleading appearance of trading as well as contributed to the price in the scrip of RGL (during patch 2) and, therefore, have violated the provisions of Section 12A(a), (b), and (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), and (d) and 4(1), (2) (a) and (e) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003?  b. If yes, whether the Noticees are liable for penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992? c. If yes, what should be the quantum of penalty that should be imposed on the Noticee(s)? 8. Before moving forward further, the relevant extracts of the provision of law, allegedly violated by the Noticees, are mentioned as under-    Page 4 of 10   SEBI Act, 1992 Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control. 12A.

Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities.

Further analysis of these 1420 trades revealed that in 379 trades for 2,24,612 shares, the counterparties were Group Entities. I note that trading among Group Entities contributed Rs. 23.35 to positive LTP which is 7.77% of total market LTP.

It was observed that the above mentioned Group entities (16 buyers and 8 sellers) carried out intra group trading in Patch 2 of the IP, and contributed Rs. 23.35 (7.77%) of market positive LTP. Therefore, it was alleged that the intragroup trading amongst the Group entities resulted in false and misleading appearance of trading in the scrip as well as contributed to price rise in the scrip during Patch 2.    Page 9 of 10  15. Therefore, it was alleged that the intragroup trading in patch 2, by the Group Entities, including the Noticees, was with a manipulative intent to increase the share price of RGL. Thus, the Noticees were alleged to have violated sections 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a) & (e) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. 16. I note from the website of Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) that the status of the Noticees is being shown as \\\\\\\\u201cStrike Off\\\\\\\\u201d. In this regard, copies of the Company Master data of the Noticees from the MCA website are placed in the file. Since the status of the Noticees is showing as \\\\\\\\u201cStrike Off\\\\\\\\u201d, it is imperative to see whether the Noticees are existing or not.  17. On perusal of the various \\\\\\\\u2018Form No. STK-7, Notice of Striking Off and Dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019, as available on the MCA website, I note that Registrar of Companies, Maharashtra has declared pursuant to Section 248(5) of the Companies Act, 2013, that the Noticee companies have been struck off the Register of Companies, through various notices. The details in this regard are as follows: Name of the Noticee Date of the \\\\\\\\u2018Form No. STK-7, Notice of Striking Off and Dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 Date of dissolution as per the Notice Udbal Mercantile Pvt Ltd August 18, 2017 August 11, 2017 Devakantha Trading Pvt Ltd July 10, 2017 June 16, 2017 18. It is noted from the records that the present adjudication proceedings were approved on September 01, 2017 and the AO was appointed on September 04, 2017, pursuant to which it was contemplated by SEBI to issue settlement notices to various entities in the matter.  Subsequently, in March 2018, the matter was referred for adjudication proceedings. I note that the Noticees were struck off the    Page 10 of 10  register of companies and dissolved even before the matter was referred for adjudication proceedings. 19. Since the Noticees have been \\\\\\\\u201cdissolved\\\\\\\\u201d, in the facts and circumstances of the instant case, I conclude that the adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticees vide SCN dated November 02, 2018 cannot be proceeded with.

In view of my findings noted in the preceding paragraphs and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against Noticees viz.

However, CCBPL did not submit its bank account statement reflecting the payment received by it. Thus, its bank account statement of CCBPL was obtained from HDFC Bank. As per bank statement, CCBPL received partial amount of Rs. 35,71,800 (as  Adjudication Order in respect of Somar Commodities Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Golden Legand Leasing and Finance Ltd.     Page 6 of 24  compared to Rs. 41,50,000 mentioned in the DIS) from SCPL on 11/03/2015 i.e. after more than 18 months of transfer of shares to SCPL (Annexure 9 to SCN).  19. From the details obtained from the CCBPL, the transferees, depositories and DIS slips, the relevant details are summarized as follows:- Table \\\\\\\\u2013 4 Sr. No. Name of transferee Transferred Quantity Date of transfer of shares Amount as mentioned in DIS (in Rs.)

It was seen that the Noticee has paid partial consideration (as compared to amount mentioned in the DIS) for acquisition of securities to CCBPL, that too, after more than 18 months of actual receipt of shares. Thus, it was alleged that the dealings of the transferor and transferees do not conform with the provisions of Spot Delivery Contract as mentioned at Section 2(i) of the SCRA. Hence, the Noticee allegedly violated Section 16 SCRA read with SEBI Notification S.O. 184(E) dated March 01, 2000, as well as Section 13 and Section 18 of SCRA read with Section 2(i) of SCRA.  21.

As per the data submitted by CDSL, SCPL had transferred 13,49,720 shares of GLLFL to 85 unique entities in off market mode during the investigation period. NSDL submitted that no off market transactions were observed in the demat account of SCPL during the investigation period.   22.

As verified from the bank account statement of SCPL during the investigation period, it is observed that the entities have not made any payment to SCPL for the above mentioned transactions even though the reason for transfer of shares has been mentioned as \\\\\\\\u201cagainst payment received\\\\\\\\u201d by SCPL in the DIS slips.  28. The Noticee (SCPL) received consideration for transfer of shares of GLLFL in off-market mode to the transferees mentioned at Sr. No. 1 to 85 in the Table-6 above. Off-market dealings are required to conform to the conditions mentioned in Spot Delivery Contract provisions as mentioned at Section 2(i) of SCRA read with Section 16 of SCRA read with SEBI Notification S.O. 184(E) dated March 01, 2000, and Section 13 and Section 18 of SCRA, in order to be valid.   29. As per the Spot Delivery Contract provisions mentioned at Section 2(i) of the SCRA the transferees were required to make actual payment for the shares on the same day as the date of the receipt of shares or on the next day. However, it was observed from the Table-6 above that the transferees mentioned at Sr. No. 1-82 paid consideration to SCPL much before the shares were actually transferred to them in their demat accounts and the transferees mentioned at Sr. No. 83-85 paid consideration to SCPL after more than two days of the receipt of the shares in their demat accounts. Thus, the dealings of the transferor and transferees allegedly do not conform to the provisions of Spot Delivery Contract as mentioned at Section 2(i) of the SCRA.  Adjudication Order in respect of Somar Commodities Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Golden Legand Leasing and Finance Ltd.     Page 18 of 24  30. In view of the above, SCPL along with entities mentioned at Sr. No. 1 to 85 in Table-6 were alleged to have violated Section 16 SCRA read with SEBI Notification S.O. 184(E) dated March 01, 2000, Section 13 and Section 18 of SCRA read with Section 2(i) of SCRA.   31. The SCN was served upon the Noticee on 02.12.2020 by e-mail.   32. Vide reply dated 07.02.2021, the Noticee submitted the following:- (a) The Noticee company is struck off from the Register and dissolved by Registrar of Companies as per Section 560 of the companies Act, 1956 in response to their application to the ROC for strike off their company through Fast Track Exit mode on April 29, 2015. (b) SCN is issued after a gap of more than 8 years from the date of transaction in shares of GLLFL i.e. in the year 2013. However, no reasons have been mentioned in the SCN for belatedly initiating present proceedings after an unexplained delay of more than 8 years. Hence, there is an inordinate delay in initiation of proceedings by SEBI. (c) Noticee sold shares of GLLFL to different unrelated entities at an agreed consideration which is received in the bank of the Noticee company.

(vii) Based on the above chronology of events, investigation observed that the UPSI came into existence on November 22, 2016 i.e. the date when there was initial introduction and understanding of stock split concept with advantages and disadvantages and real life examples were presented by CFO. In view of the same, the period of UPSI was identified as November 22, 2016 to June 26, 2017.  (viii) Investigation observed that the Noticees traded in the scrip of IAL during the period of UPSI. Noticees no. 1, 2 and 3 together are hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cDhiren Group\\\\\\\\u201d.

During post UPSI period, altogether they sold 2,54,996 shares worth of Rs.32,98,20,512/-. However, it was observed that none of these entities had traded in the scrip of IAL in pre- Final Order in the matter of Infibeam Avenues Limited Page 7 of 41  UPSI period from August 1, 2016 to November 21, 2016.     (xi) On the basis of information received from IAL through its letter dated June 21, 2019 and certain other entities regarding details of persons including Promoters/Directors/Employees and/or any other persons who were having access to and/or in possession of the information pertaining to the composite scheme, investigation had identified Vishal Mehta as an \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d as per the provisions of the PIT Regulations, 2015. Investigation observed that Vishal Mehta was the Managing Director of the Company during the investigation period and, as such, is connected to the Company and was reasonably expected to have access to the UPSI. Therefore, Investigation observed that Vishal Mehta was an \\\\\\\\u2018Insider\\\\\\\\u2019 in terms of Regulation 2(1)(g)(ii) of the PIT Regulations, 2015.   (xii) Investigation observed that Vishal Mehta, who is promoter and also the Managing Director of IAL, is the brother of Malav Mehta, who is a director of Infinium Motors (Gujarat) Pvt. Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cIMGPL\\\\\\\\u201d), a group company of IAL. Vishal Mehta and Malav Mehta are sons of Ajit Mehta, Chairman of IAL, and Jayashree Mehta, Promoter and shareholder of IAL and also shareholder of IMGPL. The connection is diagrammatically shown below: Final Order in the matter of Infibeam Avenues Limited Page 8 of 41     (xiii) Investigation observed that IMGPL is a group company of IAL and Malav Mehta is a director in IMGPL, who is authorized to trade on behalf of IMGPL, is also a non-executive director of IAL and brother of Vishal Mehta, MD of IAL and a person who was privy to the UPSI. Therefore, by virtue of the said connections, it was alleged that IMGPL falls with the category of deemed to be a connected person as per Regulation 2(1)(d)(ii)(j) of the PIT Regulations, 2015 and hence, an insider as per Regulation 2(1)(g)(i) of the PIT Regulations, 2015.  (xiv) Further, Investigation observed that Amee D Shah (Noticee no. 2) is the wife of Dhiren Shah, Karta of Dhiren Mahendrakumar HUF (Noticee no. 1). Dhiren Shah was a director in Affluence (Noticee no. 3) and the person in-charge of making investment decisions on behalf of Noticee no. 3. Hence, Dhiren Shah, Noticee no. 1, Noticee no. 2 and Noticee no. 3 were connected to each other.  (xv) During investigation, Dhiren Shah stated that IMGPL is the client of their broking firm Affluence (Noticee no. 3). Further, investigation observed that Dhiren Shah and Noticee no. 3 were allotted 5,88,235 shares each by IAL @ Rs.425/- during Final Order in the matter of Infibeam Avenues Limited Page 9 of 41  pre-IPO preferential allotment made in 2014 and they continue to hold significant shares of IAL in their accounts. IAL vide its reply dated March 12, 2020, stated in relation to the query on the process followed for contacting prospective allottees for the pre-IPO preferential allotment, that in certain cases, Vishal Mehta, Managing Director of the Company, on behalf of the Company, had approached the prospective allottees for making investment in the Company and in case of certain allottees, the prospective allottees had approached the Company for making the investments.  (xvi) Investigation observed that a significant amount of Rs. 49.99 Cr, had been invested by the Dhiren Group in IAL through a pre IPO preferential allotment, and this coupled with Noticee no. 3 acting as the stock broker for IMGPL\\\\\\\\u2019s trades in IAL, leads to a prima facie inference that Dhiren Group was connected to the promoters / director / KMPs of IAL and had access to the UPSI. SCN alleged that this along with the trading pattern of the entities, i.e. buying significantly during the UPSI period and not trading in any other scrip during the period, leads to a reasonable presumption that the Dhiren Group had traded in the scrip during the investigation period while in possession of the UPSI.   (xvii) In view of the above, SCN alleges that Noticee no. 1, 2 and 3 are connected persons who were reasonably expected to have access to the UPSI as per Regulation 2(1)(d) of PIT Regulations, 2015 and, hence, an insider as per Regulation 2(1)(g)(i) of PIT Regulations, 2015. Therefore, by trading in the scrip of IAL during the UPSI period, it is alleged that Noticees no. 1, 2 and 3 have violated the provisions of Section 12A (d) & (e) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 4(1) of PIT Regulations, 2015 by engaging in insider trading during the UPSI period.   (xviii) It is alleged that Noticees made wrongful gains by trading in the scrip of IAL during the period of UPSI. The wrongful gains by the Noticees while trading in the scrip of IAL during the UPSI is as follows:  Table-4 Computation of notional gain by Dhiren Mahendrakumar Shah HuF, Amee Dhiren Shah and Affluence Fincon Service (P) Ltd Final Order in the matter of Infibeam Avenues Limited Page 10 of 41   Name and Trade date(s) Buy quantity Weighted Average Purchase value (Rs.)

Thus, the Noticees no. 1, 2 and 3 (Dhiren group) collectively made unlawful gains of Rs. 2,60,93,085.85.  (xx) In view of the above, SCN calls upon Noticees to show cause as to why suitable directions including debarment and disgorgement be not issued under Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11B(1) and 11(5) of SEBI Act, 1992 for violations of Section 12A(d) and (e) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 4(1) read with 4(2) of PIT Regulations, 2015. The SCN also calls upon Noticees as to why appropriate directions for imposition of penalty under Section 11B(2) and 11(4A) read with Section 15G of Final Order in the matter of Infibeam Avenues Limited Page 11 of 41  SEBI Act, 1992 read with SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) be not issued to them.  5. In view of the aforesaid, the Impounding Order cum show cause notice dated August 24, 2020, referred to in para 1 above, came to be issued to the Noticees. Thereafter, vide email dated September 10, 2020, the following documents were provided by SEBI to the Noticees:  a. Trading details of Shah Dhiren Mahendrakumar (HUF), Amee Dhiren Shah and Affluence Fincon Service (P) Ltd.; b. Statement of Shri Dhiren Shah recorded during investigation; and c. Extract of Company\\\\\\\\u2019s (IAL\\\\\\\\u2019s) replies indicating chronology of events and details of pre-IPO preferential allotment.  6. Further, upon the request of the Noticees for the investigation report vide their email dated September 15, 2020, SEBI vide its email dated September 17, 2020 provided a copy of the extract of the investigation report to the Noticees. In response to the SCN, Noticees filed their common reply dated October 06, 2020. Upon consideration of the reply of the Noticees, in order to conduct further inquiry in the matter, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticees on November 17, 2020. The advocate for the Noticees appeared on November 17, 2020 through video conferencing and made submissions.   7. Noticee no. 1, 2 and 3 in their joint reply dated October 06, 2020 and during the personal hearing held on November 17, 2020, made inter alia the following submissions:  a. It is submitted that while SEBI has supplied a copy of the investigation report, several parts thereof have been redacted i.e. they have been arbitrarily blanked/whited out. It is not disclosed as to who authorised such redaction, more so since the same is contrary to the direction in Paragraph 42 of the SCN of the Ld. WTM which directed that \\\\\\\\u201c..SEBI shall serve upon the aforementioned persons/entities all the relevant documents including the Final Order in the matter of Infibeam Avenues Limited Page 12 of 41  investigation report and the annexures therein along with this order.\\\\\\\\u201d Similarly, the order dated 7 September 2020 of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal directed that all documents referred to in the SCN be supplied to us within 4 days of the date thereof and did not authorise or permit any purported redaction. Therefore, it was incumbent on SEBI to furnish copies of all the relevant documents, the investigation report and the annexures thereto. It was therefore not open to SEBI to redact any parts of the Investigation Report. b. The Noticees are not \\\\\\\\u201cconnected persons\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d within the meaning of the PIT Regulations, 2015. The Noticees have no connection with Infibeam, its promoters, KMPs or their family members. The Noticees unequivocally and categorically state that they had no knowledge or information about ay UPSI in infibeam and have never traded while in possession of UPSI as incorrectly alleged in the SCN or otherwise. c. In fact, the investigation report (Page 22 para 11.2) categorically records that \\\\\\\\u201con the basis UCC/KC details, Off-market transactions, Brokers replies and bank statement, no connection was found between Dhiren Group with the other suspected entities or with directors/promoters/insiders of the Company.\\\\\\\\u201d The Noticees submit that in view of the said express investigation finding, it is clear beyond doubt that we are not insiders or connected entities. d. It is therefore clear that merely because Noticee no. 2 and her husband subscribed to shares of the said company can never lead to any conclusion that Noticees are \\\\\\\\u201cconnected\\\\\\\\u201d persons or \\\\\\\\u201cinsiders\\\\\\\\u201d within the meaning of PIT Regulations. Further, the said allotment of shares was admittedly in 2014, i.e. much prior to the six months cut off time limit as per the PIT Regulations, 2015 as extracted even in the SCN itself. Therefore, in any event it can never be concluded that the Noticees are \\\\\\\\u201cconnected\\\\\\\\u201d persons or \\\\\\\\u201cinsiders\\\\\\\\u201d within the meaning of the PIT Regulations. e. The allegation that Noticee no. 1 acted as a broker for Infinium for purchasing shares of Infibeam is factually incorrect. Noticee no. 1 is not a broker of NSE or BSE. In fact, Infinium was a client of a different company named Affluence Shares and Stocks Private Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cASSPL\\\\\\\\u201d). Further, we are informed that Infinium carried out only 1 transaction through ASSPL Final Order in the matter of Infibeam Avenues Limited Page 13 of 41  wherein it bought some shares of Infibeam on 19 October 2017, i.e. 4 months after the alleged UPSI became public on 26 June 2017.  f. It may be noted that ASSPL is a broker and has more than 4500 clients and Infinium was just one of these clients who traded only once on 19 October 2017 \\\\\\\\u2013i.e. 4 months after the alleged UPSI became public as aforesaid. Therefore, no question arises of alleging that we are \\\\\\\\u201cconnected\\\\\\\\u201d persons or \\\\\\\\u201cinsiders\\\\\\\\u201d within the meaning of the PIT Regulations, or of drawing any other adverse inference against us. g. Since we are therefore not \\\\\\\\u201cconnected\\\\\\\\u201d persons, the only other way in which any allegations can be made against us of alleged violation of the PIT Regulations, is if investigations established that we in fact had possession of the alleged UPSI. In this regard, the observation of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of SRSR Holdings Pvt. Ltd. & Ors vs. SEBI (Order dated 11 August 2017) are most relevant. There is no material or basis to allege that we in fact had possession of the alleged UPSI. The SCN does not even allege any facts to indicate that we got possession of the alleged UPSI or as to how we got possession of the alleged UPSI. As a matter of fact, none of us even had possession of the alleged UPSI. h. In this context, we submit that the observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Tribunal in the matter of Samir Arora vs. SEBI (SAT Appeal no. 83 of 2004) are most relevant. From the said order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Tribunal, it is clear that it is obligatory on the part of SEBI to clearly show as to how according to SEBI the Noticees had \\\\\\\\u201caccess\\\\\\\\u201d to the alleged UPSI, however, the SCN miserably fails to do so. There is not even a whisper as to who provided access and how. The SCN is absolutely silent on this aspect because in fact no such alleged UPSI was ever communicated to any of the Noticees. The allegation of having access to UPSI is merely on the basis of assumptions, presumptions and surmise.  i. Without prejudice to the forgoing it is submitted even if the CFO of Infibeam gave any such alleged initial introduction/understanding of the concept of stock split on November 22, 2016, the same can never amount to any UPSI at all. In fact, from the chronology allegedly supplied by Infibeam to SEBI, it would appear that there was only a discussion between the MD and CFO of Infibeam and not even the board of Directors was made aware of the same. Final Order in the matter of Infibeam Avenues Limited Page 14 of 41  j. It appears from the SCN and other documents supplied that in fact at that time, an SAR scheme and an amalgamation were also being discussed. Curiously, the same are not alleged to be UPSI. k. We submit that a stock split per se cannot be UPSI. No money is raised, no asset is acquired, only the face value is sub divided and the market price per share also is proportionately deceased. The stock split cannot even be said to be \\\\\\\\u201cchange in capital structure\\\\\\\\u201d. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India defines capital structure as \\\\\\\\u201cCapital Structure is the combination of capitals from different sources of finance.\\\\\\\\u201d These include combination and optimisation of Equity Capital, Preference Capital and Borrowed Capital (Debt). Stock Split does not result in change in Capital Structure or fall under any other categories of information that could amount to UPSI. Therefore, there was no UPSI and consequently there can be no question of any of us trading while being in possession of any UPSI and therefore the charge against the Noticees is liable to be completely dropped. l. With regard to the increase in trading volume at BSE on June 27, 2017, even according to the investigation report, prior to the said announcement, the price of the scrip had moved from an opening price of 973.80 on 31 May 2017 to a closing price of Rs. 1036.85 on 23 June 2017 i.e. a net rise of 6.47%. Even according to the Investigation Report, post the said announcement the price of the scrip was observed to have moved from an opening price of Rs. 1032 on 27 June 2017 to a closing price of Rs. 1124.40 on July 17, 2017 i.e. a rise of 8.95%. Therefore, there was anyway a upward price movement before and after the said alleged UPSI was made public and therefore the particular change of price from June 23, 2017 to 27 June 2017 (June 24, 25 and 26 were non-trading days) cannot be said to be on account of the alleged announcement by the company that it was considering a stock split. m. In any event, the said variation in prices of 1.46% on BSE and 1.25% on NSE are totally insignificant and normal price movements irrespective of any alleged UPSI. There are 48 other instances of price increases of more than 1.46% and 54 other instances of price increases of more than 1.25% during the investigation period of 22 November 2016 to 26 June 2017, which obviously have no co-relation to any alleged UPSI. Further, as stated in the Final Order in the matter of Infibeam Avenues Limited Page 15 of 41  investigation report, the scrip had an upward momentum and therefore the price rise cannot be attributed to any announcement. This proves that the said price change on June 27, 2017 was not because of the stock split or any other alleged UPSI, but was just a normal change in the price of the said scrip.  n. The allegation in para 8 of the SCN that the trade volumes increased on June 27, 2017 after the disclosure of UPSI is belied by the volume details in para 7 of the SCN itself, which shows that the total volumes (BSE and NSE) reduced from 7,27,657 shares on June 23, 2017 to 6,80,656 shares on June 27, 2017. In fact, the average volume during the investigation period was around 7.95 lakh shares per day and therefore, there is no increase in volume in the scrip on June 27, 2017 after the disclosure of UPSI as incorrectly alleged in the SCN. The reduction in volume also goes on to substantiate that not even the markets had considered stock split to be price sensitive information, failing which there would have been at least some increase in volumes. Therefore, it can be construed that the information of stock split is no way a price sensitive information and therefore not a UPSI. o. In paras 29 to 32 of the SCN it is alleged that after the price increase because of the public announcement of the said intended split of shares, the market rate was Rs. 1049.85. Yet the above table proves that even prior thereto, shares had been bought by the Noticees at higher prices on at least 3 days (1051 on 19-06-2017, 1056 on 21-06-2017 and 1051 on 22-06-2017). This also proves that the said information was not UPSI and did not affect the price. Further, the SCN itself states that Affluence in fact sold off 3 lakh shares during the UPSI period, and that the bulk of the shares are being held by the Noticees to date. The same proves that there was no insider trading at all, since otherwise, Affluence would have only sold after the said announcement and we would have sold off our entire holdings. p. Even as per the allegations in the SCN itself, the Noticees held 2,77,020 (5,32,016-2,54,996) shares after the alleged UPSI was made public. Therefore, the said investment was not based on any alleged UPSI. Had the Noticees bought the shares to take advantage of any alleged UPSI, then obviously they would have sold the entire holding on June 27, 2017 after the said announcement/publication of the alleged UPSI. This substantiates that Final Order in the matter of Infibeam Avenues Limited Page 16 of 41  our transactions were not based on any alleged UPSI as incorrectly alleged or at all. By the explanation to Section 11B, in any event, so called \\\\\\\\u201cnotional gains\\\\\\\\u201d can never be disgorged and the language of the SEBI Act itself requires actual gains or loss avoided to be disgorged. The gains alleged in the SCN are \\\\\\\\u201cnotional\\\\\\\\u201d and therefore there cannot be any disgorgement of \\\\\\\\u201cnotional gains\\\\\\\\u201d. q. Further, no question can arise of impounding or disgorgement of any alleged \\\\\\\\u201cnotional\\\\\\\\u201d gains in respect of shares that were never sold by us. The same is neither \\\\\\\\u201cprofit made\\\\\\\\u201d nor \\\\\\\\u201closses averted\\\\\\\\u201d and SEBI itself has in other matters admitted and acknowledged that no one can be directed to disgorge \\\\\\\\u201cnotional profits\\\\\\\\u201d in respect of shares that were not sold and are retained. r. As regards the standard of proof required to establish a violation under the PIT Regulations, it is pertinent to refer to the ratio of Dilip Pendse vs. SEBI (Order dated Nov 19, 2009 in SAT Appeal no. 80 of 2009). In light of abovementioned settled law, it is submitted that an allegation of insider trading requires a high standard of empirical evidence and proof and the same cannot be based on mere conjecture and surmise. There is not an iota of evidence to show that the Noticees had possession of any alleged UPSI at the time of trading. Therefore, the allegations in the SCN are mere bald assertions without any basis, material, substance or merits. The Noticees are not insiders or connected persons.  8. I have considered the allegations made in the SCN, submissions made by the Noticees in their replies and during the personal hearing.
