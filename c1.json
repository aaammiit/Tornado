The referred AO order dated June 30, 2014 was appealed before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (\\\\\\\\u2018SAT\\\\\\\\u2019) by the Noticees. In the matter, SAT, vide its order dated April 15, 2016, with respect to Noticee Kejas (Appeal No 419 of 2014) Shreya (Appeal No 431 of 2014), Prasada (Appeal No. 341 of 2014) and Rajan (Appeal No. 136 of 2015) had stated that:  i. \\\\\\\\u201cBasic grievance of the appellants in Appeal No. 419 of 2014 and 431 of 2014 is that they were neither served with the show cause notice nor served with the notice for personal hearing. It is the case of the appellants that there was change in their correspondence address and by letter dated April 09, 2014, the said change in the address was brought to the notice of AO. However, without issuing any notice to the appellants, the impugned ex-parte order has been passed on June 30, 2014. Fact that the appellants had informed SEBI about the change in address by letter dated April 09, 2014 is not in dispute. In these circumstances, we deem it proper to set aside the ex-parte order qua the appellant in Appeal No. 419 of 2014 and appellant in Appeal No. 431 of 2014 and restore the matter to the AO for passing fresh order on merits and in accordance with law, after serving the show cause notice and after giving an opportunity of filing reply and personal hearing to each appellant.  ii. Grievance of the appellant in Appeal No. 341 of 2014 is that the ex-parte order is passed against him without furnishing the requisite documents called for by appellant vide letter dated November 26, 2013. It is not in dispute that the appellant even after receiving partial inspection of document, by a letter dated November 26, 2013, had sought inspection of certain documents. Although inspection of documents was given on December 30, 2013, it is the case of the appellant that full inspection has not been given. It is relevant to note that the appellant for the first time in this appeal has emphatically denied the charge that the appellant had certified the financial statement from April 2011 to March 2012. Although SEBI in its reply has reiterated that the appellant had certified the said financial statement, there is nothing on record to suggest that SEBI has verified the signature on the relevant financial statement and found that the said signature is that of the appellant. In any event since the impugned order is an ex-parte order and the order passed against the company in which the appellant was a director is set aside and restored for fresh decision, it would be just and proper to set aside the impugned order qua the appellant in Appeal No.341 of 2014 and restore the matter for fresh decisions on merits and in accordance with law. AOAdjudication Order in respect of TSL, Pavan Kuchana, Ramaswamy Kuchana, Durga Kuchana, Kamal Kuchana, VK Prasada Rao and Ravi Kusam in the matter of Taksheel Solutions Ltd.  -Page 7 of 124  is directed to give inspection of the financial statement allegedly certified by the appellant and other related documents claimed by the appellant and thereafter proceed to hear the appellant and pass order as deemed fit. iii. Appellant in Appeal No. 136 of 2015 was admittedly served with the show cause notice, but the appellant herein has failed to file reply to the show cause notice and has failed to attend the personal hearing offered to the appellant. In such a case, although no fault can be found with the AO in proceeding to pass ex-parte order, in the facts of present case, since the impugned order passed against the Company (Appellant in Appeal No. 431 of 2014) and the director Mr.Kejas Parmar (appellant in Appeal No. 419 of 2014) is set aside and restored to the file of AO for fresh decision on merits, in our opinion, it is just and proper to set aside the impugned order against the appellant in Appeal No. 136 of 2015 who was also at the relevant time a director of the Company and restore the matter for fresh decisions on merits and in accordance with law. iv. There is one more reason for remanding all these matters and that reason is the conflicting orders passed by the AO of SEBI while imposing penalty under Section 15HA of SEBI Act. In some cases, for example in case of Krishna Enterprises vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 131 of 2015) the AO has held that where a person adopts fraudulent and deceptive devices, then that person violates Section 12A of SEBI Act as well as regulation 3 of PFUTP Regulations 2003 and in such a case, penalty imposable under Section 15HA of SEBI Act for violating Section 12A of SEBI Act and for violating regulation 3 of PFUTP Regulations 2003 would be independent and separate. However, in the cases in hand the AO has considered the violations under Section 12A and regulation 3 together and imposed a common penalty under Section 15HA of SEBI Act. It is relevant to note that penalty imposable under Section 15HA is up to Rs. 25 crore. In such a case, it would be improper on part of AO\\\\\\\\u2019s of SEBI to pass conflicting orders which is neither in the interests of SEBI nor in the interests of the securities market. In these circumstances, for all the aforesaid reasons, we set aside the impugned order qua the appellants herein and restore the matters to the file of AO for fresh decision on merits and in accordance with law as expeditiously as possible. All contentions of both sides kept open.  10. Further, SAT vide order dated April 27, 2016, with respect to Kamal Kuchana (Appeal No. 321 of 2014), Ramaswamy Kuchana ( Appeal No. 342 of 2014), Durga Kuchana (Appeal No. 343 of 2014), Ravi Kusam ( Appeal No. 344 of 2014) and TSL& Pavan (Appeal No. 345 of 2014) had stated that:   \\\\\\\\u2018Accordingly, for the reasons stated in our order dated April 15, 2016 in Appeal No. 419 of 2014 and Appeal No. 341 of 2014, the orders passed against the appellants in these appeals are quashed and restored to the file of the Adjudicating Officer for fresh decision on merits and in accordance with law. All contentions of both the parties are kept open\\\\\\\\u2019.Adjudication Order in respect of TSL, Pavan Kuchana, Ramaswamy Kuchana, Durga Kuchana, Kamal Kuchana, VK Prasada Rao and Ravi Kusam in the matter of Taksheel Solutions Ltd.  -Page 8 of 124  SEBI ORDER  11.

In the matter, SAT, vide its order dated April 15, 2016, with respect to Noticee Kejas (Appeal No 419 of 2014) Shreya (Appeal No 431 of 2014), Prasada (Appeal No. 341 of 2014) and Rajan (Appeal No. 136 of 2015) had stated that:  i. \\\\\\\\u201cBasic grievance of the appellants in Appeal No. 419 of 2014 and 431 of 2014 is that they were neither served with the show cause notice nor served with the notice for personal hearing. It is the case of the appellants that there was change in their correspondence address and by letter dated April 09, 2014, the said change in the address was brought to the notice of AO. However, without issuing any notice to the appellants, the impugned ex-parte order has been passed on June 30, 2014. Fact that the appellants had informed SEBI about the change in address by letter dated April 09, 2014 is not in dispute. In these circumstances, we deem it proper to set aside the ex-parte order qua the appellant in Appeal No. 419 of 2014 and appellant in Appeal No. 431 of 2014 and restore the matter to the AO for passing fresh order on merits and in accordance with law, after serving the show cause notice and after giving an opportunity of filing reply and personal hearing to each appellant.  ii. Grievance of the appellant in Appeal No. 341 of 2014 is that the ex-parte order is passed against him without furnishing the requisite documents called for by appellant vide letter dated November 26, 2013. It is not in dispute that the appellant even after receiving partial inspection of document, by a letter dated November 26, 2013, had sought inspection of certain documents. Although inspection of documents was given on December 30, 2013, it is the case of the appellant that full inspection has not been given. It is relevant to note that the appellant for the first time in this appeal has emphatically denied the charge that the appellant had certified the financial statement from April 2011 to March 2012. Although SEBI in its reply has reiterated that the appellant had certified the said financial statement, there is nothing on record to suggest that SEBI has verified the signature on the relevant financial statement and found that the said signature is that of the appellant. In any event since the impugned order is an ex-parte order and the order passed against the company in which the appellant was a director is set aside and restored for fresh decision, it would be just and proper to set aside the impugned order qua the appellant in Appeal No.341 of 2014 and restore the matter for fresh decisions on merits and in accordance with law. AOAdjudication Order in respect of TSL, Pavan Kuchana, Ramaswamy Kuchana, Durga Kuchana, Kamal Kuchana, VK Prasada Rao and Ravi Kusam in the matter of Taksheel Solutions Ltd.  -Page 7 of 124  is directed to give inspection of the financial statement allegedly certified by the appellant and other related documents claimed by the appellant and thereafter proceed to hear the appellant and pass order as deemed fit. iii. Appellant in Appeal No. 136 of 2015 was admittedly served with the show cause notice, but the appellant herein has failed to file reply to the show cause notice and has failed to attend the personal hearing offered to the appellant. In such a case, although no fault can be found with the AO in proceeding to pass ex-parte order, in the facts of present case, since the impugned order passed against the Company (Appellant in Appeal No. 431 of 2014) and the director Mr.Kejas Parmar (appellant in Appeal No. 419 of 2014) is set aside and restored to the file of AO for fresh decision on merits, in our opinion, it is just and proper to set aside the impugned order against the appellant in Appeal No. 136 of 2015 who was also at the relevant time a director of the Company and restore the matter for fresh decisions on merits and in accordance with law. iv. There is one more reason for remanding all these matters and that reason is the conflicting orders passed by the AO of SEBI while imposing penalty under Section 15HA of SEBI Act. In some cases, for example in case of Krishna Enterprises vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 131 of 2015) the AO has held that where a person adopts fraudulent and deceptive devices, then that person violates Section 12A of SEBI Act as well as regulation 3 of PFUTP Regulations 2003 and in such a case, penalty imposable under Section 15HA of SEBI Act for violating Section 12A of SEBI Act and for violating regulation 3 of PFUTP Regulations 2003 would be independent and separate. However, in the cases in hand the AO has considered the violations under Section 12A and regulation 3 together and imposed a common penalty under Section 15HA of SEBI Act. It is relevant to note that penalty imposable under Section 15HA is up to Rs. 25 crore. In such a case, it would be improper on part of AO\\\\\\\\u2019s of SEBI to pass conflicting orders which is neither in the interests of SEBI nor in the interests of the securities market. In these circumstances, for all the aforesaid reasons, we set aside the impugned order qua the appellants herein and restore the matters to the file of AO for fresh decision on merits and in accordance with law as expeditiously as possible. All contentions of both sides kept open.  10. Further, SAT vide order dated April 27, 2016, with respect to Kamal Kuchana (Appeal No. 321 of 2014), Ramaswamy Kuchana ( Appeal No. 342 of 2014), Durga Kuchana (Appeal No. 343 of 2014), Ravi Kusam ( Appeal No. 344 of 2014) and TSL& Pavan (Appeal No. 345 of 2014) had stated that:   \\\\\\\\u2018Accordingly, for the reasons stated in our order dated April 15, 2016 in Appeal No. 419 of 2014 and Appeal No. 341 of 2014, the orders passed against the appellants in these appeals are quashed and restored to the file of the Adjudicating Officer for fresh decision on merits and in accordance with law. All contentions of both the parties are kept open\\\\\\\\u2019.Adjudication Order in respect of TSL, Pavan Kuchana, Ramaswamy Kuchana, Durga Kuchana, Kamal Kuchana, VK Prasada Rao and Ravi Kusam in the matter of Taksheel Solutions Ltd.  -Page 8 of 124  SEBI ORDER  11.

Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker  BACKGROUND  1. SEBI received the following complaints against Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAllied/ AFSPL\\\\\\\\u201d), a Depository Participant of NSDL, alleging fraudulent/ unauthorized transfer of mutual fund units (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cMF Units\\\\\\\\u201d):  1.1. Complaint dated February 08, 2019, from Finsec Law Advisor on behalf of clients Dalmia Cement East Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cDCEL\\\\\\\\u201d) and OCL India Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cOCL\\\\\\\\u201d) alleging fraudulent transfer of MF Units Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 2 of 26   worth Rs. 344.07 crores by AFSPL (these complainants are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cDalmia Group\\\\\\\\u201d) and   1.2. Complaint dated December 31, 2018, January 18 and 21, 2019 from Novjoy Emporium Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNEPL\\\\\\\\u201d) alleging unauthorized transfer of MF Units worth Rs. 21 crores by AFSPL.  2. Economic Offences Wing (EOW), in its charge sheet filed in the matter, has observed that signature on the DIS used for transferring MF Units from the account of DCEL and OCL were forged. Mr. Subhas Sastri, authorized signatory of NEPL, during his statement on oath submitted that signature on the copy of the DIS used for transferring the MF Units from the account of NEPL were not his and have been forged. Mr. Sastri also submitted that the rubber stamp used on the said DIS was not of NEPL. In view of the same, it is likely that signatures on the DIS used for transferring MF units from the account of NEPL were also forged by AFSPL.  3. SEBI conducted an investigation into the matter for the period February 20, 2017, till February 08, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation period/ IP\\\\\\\\u201d) to find out violations, if any, of provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (\\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) and relevant circulars issued by SEBI. As part of the investigation, SEBI appointed a forensic auditor, Sarath & Associates, CA, to look into the functioning of AFSPL with regard to the alleged fraudulent transfer of securities from accounts of clients.   SHOW CAUSE NOTICE  4. Pursuant to conclusion of the investigation, a Show Cause Notices (SCN) dated December 09, 2019, was issued to Mutual Fund Digi Locker (MFDL) and its partners, Mr. Pankaj Garg and Mr. Jitender Malhotra (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d). It has been alleged, inter alia, that: Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 3 of 26   4.1. Noticees were employees of AFSPL and opened demat account for their partnership firm MFDL. 4.2. MF units worth Rs. 21.70 crores were transferred from account of NEPL by AFSPL to the demat account of Mr. Pankaj Garg and Mr. Jitender Malhotra. Subsequently, the units were transferred to the account of Money Mishra Financial Services (\\\\\\\\u201cMMFS\\\\\\\\u201d) and Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra (\\\\\\\\u201cAwanish\\\\\\\\u201d), Director of AFSPL. The units were then transferred to IL&FS Securities Services Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cISSL\\\\\\\\u201d) by AFSPL for taking exposure in the market. Details are as below:  Entity to whose account MF units were transferred  Name of the client of AFSPL to whose account the MF units were transferred) Value of MF Received (Rs.) Value of MF delivered back (Rs.) Net Value of MF unreturned (Rs.) Pankaj Garg (Jt holder Jitender Malhotra) pertains to partnership firm MFDL Money Mishra Financial Services 12,01,50,428 - 12,01,50,428 Awanish Kumar Mishra 9,68,54,309 - 9,68,54,309 Total 21,70,04,737  21,70,04,737   4.3. Vide interim order dated February 27, 2019, SEBI has restrained the Noticees from accessing the securities market due to their prima facie involvement in the fraudulent transfer of securities from account of NEPL. In confirmatory order dated May 17, 2019, SEBI, inter alia, observed the following:  4.3.1. Noticees submitted that AFSPL was their employer and it set up the firm MFDL. AFSPL opened demat account in the name of MFDL and executed PoA in its favour to operate the said account. 4.3.2. Noticees denied knowledge of the above mentioned transfers. No steps taken to remedy the anomaly. 4.3.3. Noticees claim to have acted under employer-employee relationship on direction of AFSPL and its incumbent directors. They claim they came to Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 4 of 26   know about transfers only after SEBI order. Despite the purported knowledge vide the interim order, they have not lodged any complaint with any authority, including SEBI. 4.3.4. They appear to conveniently deny knowledge to escape the consequences.  4.4. It was observed during investigation that Noticees had not raised any objection with respect to the anomaly that high value MF units have been transferred to the account from NEPL. Also, they allowed subsequent transfer of said MF units to accounts of MMFS, MMOPL and Awanish.   5. It is alleged that the aforesaid conduct on part of Noticees is fraudulent as it appears that they were part of the fraudulent transfer of MF units from the account of NEPL. Therefore, it is alleged that the Noticees have violated Regulations 3(a) and 4(1) of the PFUTP Regulations.  6. In view of the above allegations, Noticees were called upon to show cause as to why appropriate directions:  6.1. Under Sections 11B(1) and 11(4) read with Section 11(1) of the SEBI Act should not be issued against them for the alleged violations of the aforementioned provisions of the PFUTP Regulations. 6.2. For imposing penalty under Sections 11B(2) and 11(4A) read with Sections 15HA of the SEBI Act should not be issued against them for the alleged violations of the aforementioned provisions of the PFUTP Regulations.  REPLY, WRITTEN SUBMISSION AND ADDITIONAL SUBMISSION:  7. I note that the SCN has been delivered on the Noticees and their written submissions have been received vide letter dated December 15, 2019. The Noticees also sent certain submissions vide email dated June 25, 2020. The Noticees were granted a Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 5 of 26   personal hearing on October 29, 2020, and their submissions post the hearing have been received vide emails dated November 3 and 4, 2020. The submissions made vide letters dated December 15, 2019, November 3 and 4, 2020, are summarized below:   7.1. They provided the employment details which are as under:  Noticee Employer Period Role Pankaj Garg MMFS January-June 2017 Dealer Only worked as a dealer and operated trading terminal. Never dealt with any client or any activity in DP department AFSPL Jul 2017-Feb 2019 Dealer Jitender Malhotra MMFS Nov 2016-June 2017 Dealer AFSPL Jul 2017-Feb 2019 Dealer  7.2. They admitted to signing some blank documents i.e., partnership deed, demat account opening form and two blank DIS under the instruction of their employer, Mr. Mishra and under fear of loss of job and without having any doubt on the intention of Mr. Mishra. These documents were signed in October or December 2018. They never filled up these documents. Later on they came to know that the deed was drafted by Mr. Anil Kumar, CA, for AFSPL, on the instruction of Mr. Awanish Mishra.  7.3. They have not signed or filled documents, such as, KYC documents for MFDL, documents related to bank account of MFDL and application of PAN in the name of MFDL. They were under the impression that before use of the documents, they would be consulted and unless they give the KYC documents, the blank forms cannot be used. Once the purpose would be explained, they would decide what to do. 7.4. They were never aware of the opening of the MFDL account and hence, no question of raising objection of transfer of high value MF units into and from the account arises. They have never received any message/ email with regard to transfer of MF units. They have no role and intent to open the account of MFDL Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 6 of 26   on the basis of forged and fabricated documents. The account was opened on the direction of Mr. Mishra and the same was suppressed from them by AFSPL and Mr. Mishra.  7.5. Bank account mentioned in client master does not exist and does not belong to them. PAN also does not belong to them. The signature on KYC documents for MFDL is forged. The documents submitted by them when they joined MMFS/ AFSPL have been misused by Mr. Mishra. 7.6. Phone number and email ID shown in client master of MFDL does not have any connection with them nor have they used the same. They have never submitted these details.  7.7. They have never made any transactions for or with MFDL at any time. 7.8. They have never contacted NEPL nor received communication from anyone from NEPL before or after the fraud. They were not aware of the opening of the demat account of NEPL. 7.9. Only signing of blank forms cannot be taken as fraudulent or our involvement or consent in the conspiracy at all. There is no question of consent/ intent and to receive any gain out of illegal act. Conduct of merely not raising objection cannot conclude that they were involved in fraudulent transfer. 7.10. Mr. Mishra has defrauded several of his clients of AFSPL and MMFS and the Noticees by taking their signatures and using the same to illegally open demat account of MFDL and cheat NEPL. 7.11. NEPL has filed complaint with EOW, Mumbai, but they have not been called by the EOW. They were called by EOW, New Delhi, for complaint of Dalmia Group but they are not part of the chargesheet. 7.12. They filed complaint with EOW, New Delhi, against AFSPL and Mr. Mishra vide letter dated October 23, 2019. They tried to register a complaint on March 04, 2019, with the Noida police but were turned away. They have provided details of how they have tried to get complaints registered with various authorities. 7.13. They do not have the forensic auditors report or the EOW chargesheet, which is prejudicial to their interest. They are not aware of any of the forgery, as Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 7 of 26   mentioned on the DIS slips. They were waiting to submit the facts in their knowledge during investigation but no opportunity was given to them.  8. As the Noticees had submitted that they had not been provided with certain documents, in the interest of natural justice, documents, such as, relevant extract of the forensic auditor\\\\\\\\u2019s report and Account Opening Form, Client Master List, transaction statement and partnership deed of MFDL were provided to the Noticees. Another opportunity of hearing was also granted on July 30, 2021, wherein the Noticees appeared and made their submissions. Additional submissions have been received vide emails dated July 26, 2021, and August 3, 2021. These submissions are summarized as below:   8.1. They have not signed on any documents such as account opening forms for bank account, trading account and demat account and for PAN card. 8.2. The AOF has no application number. The photo of Pankaj Garg is pasted on the form and the applicant name should be Pankaj Garg but the applicant name is MFDL. As the name of Pankaj Garg is not mentioned anywhere on the form, hence there is no question of his sign being on the form. Hence, the AOF is fake. 8.3. They have no relation with NEPL and have never communicated with them. Hence, there is no question of receiving such high value MF units from NEPL. The entire fraud has been carried out by Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra. 8.4. Address mentioned on the holding statement is G-14 Sector 3, Noida, which is the address of the Noida office of AFSPL. This proves that MFDL belongs to Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra. 8.5. Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra has used the documents submitted by them at the time of their joining AFSPL.  9. In summary, the replies of the Noticees are as under:   9.1. They agree to have signed blank documents viz., partnership deed, demat AOF and DIS on the instruction of Mr. Awanish Mishra. Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 8 of 26   9.2. While initially they have agreed that they signed blank demat account opening form at the instruction of Mr. Awanish Mishra, in their most recent submission, they have denied signing on any account opening forms.  9.3. They have submitted that they were never aware of opening of demat account in name of MFDL and of the transfers in this account. They have never signed KYC documents for MFDL and made application for PAN of NEPL. 9.4. Bank account mentioned in client master of MFDL does not exist/ belong to them. 9.5. Phone number and email ID shown in client master of MFDL does not have any connection with them. 9.6. As they never received any message/ email with regard to transfer of MF units, there is no scope of raising any objection to these transfers. They have no connection with NEPL. 9.7. They were not aware of the forgery or illegal acts with respect to the Dalmia Group accounts. 9.8. Only signing of blank forms cannot be taken as fraudulent and neither does it show their involvement or consent in the conspiracy. There is no question of consent/ intent to receive any gain out of illegal act. Further, the conduct of merely not raising objection cannot conclude that they were involved in fraudulent transfer. 9.9. They became aware of these activities only after interim order of SEBI dated February 27, 2019.   ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION:  10. I have perused the SCNs, replies, written submissions and other materials available on record. In the context of the above mentioned allegations, the following issues arise for consideration in order to examine whether the alleged violations of the PFUTP Regulations are maintainable. They are as follows: Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 9 of 26   10.1. Issue No. 1: Whether the conduct of the Noticees, as alleged in the SCN, has by being part of the fraud, facilitated the fraudulent transfer of MF units from the demat account of NEPL?   10.2. Issue No. 2: If Issue No. 1 is determined in the affirmative, whether Noticees have committed fraud/ unfair trade practice, as alleged in the SCN?  10.3. Issue No. 3: If Issue No. 2 is answered in affirmative, then whether Noticees are responsible for these violations?  10.4. Issue No. 4: If answer to Issue No. 2 above is affirmative, then whether any directions are required to be issued against the Noticees?  Issue No. 1: Whether the conduct of the Noticees, as alleged in the SCN, has by being part of the fraud, facilitated the fraudulent transfer of MF units from the demat account of NEPL?  11. Before proceeding further, the use of the demat account of Mutual Fund Digi Locker has to be seen in the context of the fraudulent transfer of MF units from the demat account of NEPL. It has been alleged in the SCN that the conduct of the Noticees is fraudulent as it appears that by being part of the fraud, they have facilitated the fraudulent transfer of MF units from the account of NEPL. The investigation has revealed the following movement of the MF units from the demat account NEPL:  11.1. The MF units were first transferred to the demat account of the Noticees held on behalf of MFDL. 11.2. From this demat account, the MF units were transferred to demat accounts of Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra and his associate entity. 11.3. Subsequently, the MF units were transferred to ISSL for getting exposure in the market. Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 10 of 26   12. Vide SEBI order dated July 02, 2021, in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd., it has been determined that AFSPL and Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra have fraudulently transferred the MF units from the demat account of NEPL and used them as collateral.   13. The Noticees have submitted that they are not aware of these fraudulent transactions and have no role to play in them. As noted earlier, it is alleged in the SCN that the Noticees, by virtue of their conduct and by being part of the fraud, they have facilitated the fraudulent transfer of MF units from the demat account of NEPL. It is noted that the PFUTP Regulations prevents acts of commission and omission, which are fraudulent or unfair in nature. The facilitation of fraud through an \\\\\\\\u201cact\\\\\\\\u201d of \\\\\\\\u201comission\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201ccommission\\\\\\\\u201d, itself is treated as fraudulent as per the PFUTP Regulations if it facilitates any other fraud. The objective of the PFUTP Regulations is also to prevent \\\\\\\\u201cfacilitation\\\\\\\\u201d in the same way that it intends to prevent the fraudulent \\\\\\\\u201cact\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201comission\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, independent of whether the facilitated act fructifies or not, it does not make the \\\\\\\\u201cfacilitating act or omission\\\\\\\\u201d legal and/ or permissible. In other words, for a proceeding against the \\\\\\\\u201cact\\\\\\\\u201d of facilitation, it is not material whether the facilitated act of fraud has fructified or not. Whether the same has fructified is not material for proceeding against the Noticees for an allegation of fraudulent conduct of facilitation. Also, the Noticees, as facilitators, are not required to be aware of the entire gamut of the fraudulent act facilitated by them. However, there should be circumstances that raise red flags requiring further enquiry to be made, which the facilitators chose not to make. Raising of relevant queries would have brought to their actual knowledge the gamut of fraud. The omission to make such enquiry, despite the circumstances of red flags, coupled with the acts of commission, taints the act as facilitation of fraud. As facilitation itself is fraud and is separate from the fraudulent act which is facilitated, the contention of the Noticees that they are not aware of the fraudulent transactions is not sustainable.  14. The short name of this account, as mentioned in the Client Master List (CML), appears to have been chosen to misrepresent that the securities are secure in a digital- locker. Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 11 of 26   Hence, I note that the demat account of MFDL was opened only to hold temporarily the MF units received from the demat account of NEPL for the purpose of misrepresentation to NEPL that its securities are secured in a digital- locker.   15. It is alleged in the SCN that by virtue of the following conduct of Noticee Nos. 2 and 3 i.e., the partners of MFDL, they are part of the fraud and have facilitated the fraudulent transfer of MF units from the demat account of NEPL:   15.1. They did not raise any objection when high value of MF units was received into the demat account of MFDL. 15.2. They subsequently permitted the transfer of these MF units from the demat account of MFDL to the demat account of MMFS and Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra.  16. I note here that in their first reply to the SCN dated December 15, 2019, Noticee Nos. 2 and 3 have accepted that they signed blank partnership deed, blank demat KYC/ AOF and blank DIS at the instructions of their employer, Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra. In their communication sent on June 25, 2020, they have accepted that they signed on certain documents at the instruction of Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra. However, in their recent submissions made vide emails dated July 26, 2021, and August 3, 2021, the Noticees have denied signing on any document, including the demat AOF. I note that the Noticees have now provided contrary submissions but have not given any explanation for this change in their submissions. The Noticees have also submitted that if their signature on their PAN card is compared with the signatures on the documents, then it is clear that the two are different. However, I note that they have not provided any order from a Competent Court on the aspect of mismatch of signature to the effect that the signatures on the documents, such as, partnership deed, account opening forms, etc., are not the signature of the Noticees. Instead, in their complaint dated October 23, 2019, registered with the EOW, New Delhi, the Noticees have stated that based on the instructions of Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra, they have signed the partnership deed and other documents. Hence, I am not inclined to accept their Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 12 of 26   current case of denial of signature on any blank documents such as partnership deed, demat AOF and DIS, as the same appears to be an afterthought. Therefore, I find that there is no contrary material on record, except their claim based on afterthought, which can lead to disregarding their admission that they signed blank partnership deed, blank demat KYC/ AOF and blank DIS at the instructions of their employer, Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra, both to SEBI and the EOW.  17. Further, the Client Master List (CML) for the demat account obtained from NSDL shows the following particulars:   17.1. The short name of the account is \\\\\\\\u201cMutual Fund Digi\\\\\\\\u201d. 17.2. Pankaj Garg is the first holder, while Jitender Malhotra is the second holder.  17.3. The mobile number linked with this account is 9315445615, while the bank account is 915020021793409.  18. NSDL further informed that transaction alerts by SMS for debit transfers in the demat account have been sent on the mobile number captured in the demat account. Jio, the service provider for the said mobile number, stated that the mobile number was registered in the name of a certain Mr. Manoj Kumar. I note here that there is no material on record to show any connection of this person with the Noticees. Information provided by Axis Bank regarding the holder of the bank account linked with the demat account, shows that bank account belonged to AFSPL.   19. From the above, it can be construed that the alerts for debit transactions were sent to an entity who, as per material available on record, is not connected to the Noticees. Further, the bank account linked to the demat account belonged to AFSPL and as the KYC available on record does not contain any bank account number, the same implies that the Noticee have failed to make any enquiry after signing on the blank account opening documents and therefore, they have actively facilitated their accounts to be misused. Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 13 of 26   20. I note from their own submissions that these Noticees have been associated with the securities market for a long time (21 years in the case of Mr. Pankaj Garg and 11 years in the case of Mr. Jitender Malhotra), mostly in the capacity of a dealer. Both are also graduates by education and were aged 46 and 35, respectively, at the time they signed these documents (partnership deed is dated October 23, 2018). Considering these factors, I am of the view that not only were they fully aware about the nature of the blank documents that they were signing, they were also completely aware of the possibility of the potential misuse of the blank documents that they have signed. In fact, I note that these Noticees have submitted that they were under the impression that the purpose of taking their signatures on blank documents would be explained to them and at that point, if required, they would be able to refuse the use of these documents. This implies that these Noticees were aware of the import of the blank documents that they had signed i.e., they were aware of the possibility that a partnership firm could be opened with them as its partners, a demat account for this partnership firm could also be opened and the blank signed DIS slips could be used to effect transfer of securities from/ to this account. Therefore, despite being aware of the possible consequences, the Noticees, by providing their signatures on blank documents, have not only consented to all these activities but in a way have also actively facilitated the same. The submission of the Noticees that they did not provide any KYC documents does not alter the finding that they signed blank documents and are responsible for the potential misuse of these documents for facilitation of a fraud, even if the entire gamut of such fraud is not known by them.   21. As already mentioned above, the mobile number on which debit alerts were sent by NSDL belongs to a person who, as per material available on record, is not connected with the Noticees. The Noticees, by also failing to ensure that their own communication details viz., address, email ID and mobile number were entered in the account opening form so that they would receive transaction alerts as well as transaction/ holding statements directly, have actively facilitated the misuse of the demat account. Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 14 of 26   22. Apart from failure to exercise prudence when signing on blank documents, I note that the Noticees have also actively facilitated the fraud by neglecting to follow up with Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra under whose instruction they claimed to have signed the blank documents, regarding how these signed blank documents were used. The Noticees have also actively facilitated the fraud by neglecting to seek transaction/ holding statements for the demat account that would have been opened based on the blank account opening form that they signed. Had they sought such statements, they would have come to know about the transactions in the demat account much earlier and would also have been in a position to prevent further transactions. Hence, in view of the above, their submissions that they were not aware of the transactions in the account cannot be accepted as such ignorance was brought out by their own gross and willful neglect.  23. By their own admission, under fear of loss of their jobs, the Noticees have provided their signatures on blank documents. Noticee Nos. 2 and 3, despite knowing the potential of signed blank documents being misused, have consented to the following:  23.1. Use of their names for being partners in a partnership firm, 23.2. Opening of a demat account for a partnership firm and 23.3. Credit/ debit of securities into this demat account.  24. In view of the above, I hold that due to the acts of commission and omission of Noticee Nos. 2 and 3, i.e., by signing on blank documents, and their further omissions in subsequent follow up with AFSPL and Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra, they have actively facilitated the subsequent misuse of the partnership firm, MFDL, and the demat account of MFDL for facilitation of a fraud, whether or not the entire gamut of such fraud was known to them and therefore they cannot escape the liability for the same. As already noted above, the demat account of MFDL was used to misrepresent to NEPL that its MF units are held in a demat account named \\\\\\\\u2018Mutual Fund Digi Locker\\\\\\\\u2019 and as such, it was part of the scheme of fraudulent transfer of MF units. Order in the matter of Allied Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\u2013 Mutual Fund Digi Locker       Page 15 of 26   25. Therefore, I hold that the conduct of Noticee Nos. 2 and 3, by virtue of their acts of commission and omission/ neglect resulted into active facilitation of an integral part of the fraudulent transfer of the MF units from the demat account of NEPL by AFSPL and Mr. Awanish Kumar Mishra.   Issue No. 2: If Issue No. 1 is determined in the affirmative, whether Noticees have committed fraud/ unfair trade practice, as alleged in the SCN?   26. In the context of the above findings, it needs to be determined whether the above factual conclusions arrived at are a fraud under PFUTP Regulations, as alleged in the SCN.

Pursuant to receipt of certain complaints, Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) had conducted a preliminary examination in the matter of Five Core Electronics Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cthe company\\\\\\\\u201d), a company which had listed its shares on National Stock Exchange SME Platform on May 21, 2018 by issuing 33,33,000 equity shares of face value of Rs.10 each, at price of Rs.140 per equity share, raising about Rs.46 Crores. The said examination prima facie revealed that the company, its promoters / promoter group entities and /or independent directors (Noticee nos. 1 to 7 named in the Table above) had mis-utilized the funds raised through the IPO and there appeared to be a pre-meditated plan to lure investors with the intention to defraud them. Based on the findings of the examination, the Noticees were alleged to have prima facie violated the provisions of Regulation 3(d) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices__________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Five Core Electronics Limited Page 2 of 5 Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 read with Section 12A(c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 and also various provisions of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (\\\\\\\\u201cLODR Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). In view of the same, SEBI had passed an ex-parte ad-interim order dated July 23, 2020 (\\\\\\\\u201cInterim Order\\\\\\\\u201d), vide which SEBI had inter alia issued the following directions:  (a) The Noticee nos. 1 to 7 are restrained from accessing the securities market and are further prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities in any manner whatsoever, either directly or indirectly, till further orders.  (b) The Noticee nos. 1 to 7 are restrained from being associated with any intermediary registered with SEBI or any listed entity or its material unlisted subsidiary, till further orders.  (c) The Noticee nos. 1 to 7, are restrained from disposing, selling or alienating, in any other manner, their assets or divert funds, till further orders.  (d) NSE shall appoint an independent Auditor/ Audit Firm for conducting a detailed forensic audit of the books of accounts of the company to confirm mis-utilization of IPO proceeds by the company. Such appointment of forensic auditor shall be done within 30 days of this order.  (e) The Noticee nos. 1 to 7 shall extend necessary co\\\\\\\\u2013operation to the independent Auditor/Audit Firms appointed as per this Order and shall furnish all information/documents sought from them from time to time.  (f) The independent Auditor/ Audit Firm so appointed as per this Order shall submit a Report to SEBI through NSE within 3 months of date of its appointment.   2. Prior to the issuance of the Interim Order, NSE had conducted visit to the company at its registered office, its manufacturing site and its R&D Centre on May 06, 2019. NSE observed that all these offices were shut and the same was not informed to the exchange.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Five Core Electronics Limited Page 3 of 5 Further, letters issued by SEBI during the preliminary examination to the company and its Executive Directors and Promoters at their respective addresses seeking their comments on the complaints had returned undelivered. The said letters were later affixed at the registered office of the company at Delhi. However, no replies/comments to the letters were received by SEBI from the company or its directors / promoters. Given that the letters sent to the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 addresses during the preliminary examination had returned undelivered and there was no response from the company even after affixture of letters at its registered address, the Interim Order was served on the Noticees through email by sending to email IDs \\\\\\\\u2013 investcare@5core.in, cs@5core.in, cfo@5core.in and amarjitkalra@yahoo.co.uk. The Interim Order was also uploaded on the SEBI Website. Vide the Interim order, the Noticees were advised to file their replies to the Interim Order within 21 days and also indicate in their replies whether they wanted an opportunity of personal hearing. However, till date, no response whatsoever has been received from the Noticees.   3. As per the directions issued in the Interim Order, NSE had appointed BDO India LLP as a forensic auditor for conducting a detailed forensic audit of the books of accounts of the company to confirm mis-utilization of IPO proceeds by the company. Due to the closure of the company and the absence of its employees/management, the forensic auditor did not get access to books of accounts and the transactional documentation. However, the forensic auditor obtained limited data from different sources, which included bank statements, Limited Review Financial Statements, Prospectus & List of shareholders received from NSE; Bill discounting / packing credit details, sanction letters, customer outstanding details, credit reports etc. received from Andhra Bank; Partial records for__________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Five Core Electronics Limited Page 4 of 5 domestic purchase invoices, bank statements, GST Records received from IBC Resolution Professional; GST Returns (partial records) received from statutory auditor and purchase & sale documentation (partial records) received from Department of Revenue Intelligence. NSE, vide email dated January 25, 2021 submitted the final report of the forensic auditor the findings of which require detailed investigation by SEBI.  4. Considering the fact that the Noticees have failed to respond to the prima facie observations recorded against them in the Interim Order and also the fact that findings of the forensic audit report require detailed investigation, I find that there are no justifiable reasons for dis-continuing or modifying the directions issued vide the Interim Order. However, it has now been brought to my notice that there is a proceeding under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) against the company before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLT, New Delhi Bench (Court II), wherein an order dated January 23, 2020 [IB-1671(ND)2019] has been passed declaring a moratorium in terms of Section 14 of the IBC. The said moratorium has inter alia prohibited the following:  (a) the institution of suits or continuation of pending suits or proceedings against the corporate debtor including execution of any judgement, decree or order in any court of law, tribunal, arbitration panel or other authority;  (b) transferring, encumbering, alienating or disposing of by the corporate debtor any of its assets or any legal right or beneficial interest therein.  ORDER \\\\\\\\u2013  5. In view of the foregoing, in order to protect the interest of investors and the integrity of the securities market, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 19 read__________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Five Core Electronics Limited Page 5 of 5 with Sections 11, 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992, hereby confirm the directions issued against the Noticees, as contained in the Interim Order (reproduced under para 1 of this order), until further orders. However, as regards the company, the directions issued in the Interim Order as confirmed by this Order shall be subject to any order passed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLT, including the abovementioned order dated January 23, 2020, in the abovementioned proceeding under the IBC.  6. A copy of this Order shall be forwarded to the recognized Stock Exchanges, Depositories and RTAs for their information and compliance.     PLACE: MUMBAI G.

Notice of hearing was served on the said Noticees through email. The Noticee no. 5 attended the hearing through her representative, Naveen Kumar (Advocate) via video conferencing. However, Noticee no. 6 failed to attend the hearing.   10. The Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 6 (AATIPL, ACPL and Vandana Sinha respectively) have not filed any reply to the SCN. Considering the same, matter against them has been proceeded with ex-parte, on the basis of material available on record. Consideration of Issues and Findings:  11. I have examined the facts of the case and the allegations against the Noticee companies. I note that AATIPL and ACPL have not filed any reply / response whatsoever in respect of the SCN. Nevertheless, I proceed to look into the allegations against them and decide the matter based on material available on record. The allegations have been dealt with under different heads, one by one, in subsequent paragraphs.  Non-submission of information sought through summonses: 12. As regards the allegation of non-submission of information sought through summonses, I note from records that during the investigation, variousOrder in the matter of Amrapali Aadya Trading & Investments Pvt. Ltd. & Ors               Page 14 of 76  summonses were issued to AATIPL which were dated August 31, 2017, October 09, 2017, January 24, 2018 and February 07, 2018 under Section 11(2), 11(3) and 11C(3) read with 11C (5) of the SEBI Act, 1992 directing the Noticee company to furnish various information and documents. Similarly, summonses dated August 31, 2017 October 09, 2017, and February 07, 2018 were issued to ACPL. The SCN has alleged that the said Noticee companies did not furnish any information / documents. I note that there is nothing on record which shows that the Noticee companies had complied with the said summonses. Clauses A(1), (2) and (5) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers (Code of Conduct) specified in Schedule II of the SEBI (Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992 (Stock Brokers Regulations), provide that a stock broker shall maintain high standard of integrity, promptitude and fairness and shall act with due skill, care and diligence in the conduct of all its business. Further, the stock broker shall abide by all the provisions of SEBI Act and rules and regulations etc. Further, Regulation 9(f) of the Stock Brokers Regulations mandate that a stock broker shall at all times abide by the Code of Conduct. I find that since the Noticee companies have failed to comply with the abovementioned summonses, the allegation of violation of Clauses A(1), (2) & (5) of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 9(f) of the Stock Brokers Regulations against the Noticee companies, AATIPL and ACPL, stands established.Order in the matter of Amrapali Aadya Trading & Investments Pvt. Ltd. & Ors               Page 15 of 76  Sale of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities through employees\\\\\\\\u2019 accounts: 13. As per the findings of investigation, AATIPL had sold off securities belonging to some clients through the accounts of certain employees, viz. Deepak Kumar, Ranjit Kumar, Sanjeet Kumar and Mukesh Kumar. An analysis of the trades carried out in the accounts of the aforesaid 4 employees revealed that during the period from 01-Apr-16 to 10-Aug-17, these employees had sold securities worth Rs. 130.85 cr. It was observed that on those dates, the securities required for making the pay-in were not available in the aforesaid employees\\\\\\\\u2019 accounts. However, AATIPL has made the pay-in successfully, which meant that the securities for pay-in were arranged from other sources.  This clearly indicated that the securities of other clients were utilised for the pay-in. The details of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities sold, as provided by NSE, are as under:  Table 05: Client securities details Client code Client name Total value of net sell trades for the period (01-Apr-16 to 10-Aug-17) Total amount of net sell trades verified Amount of securities sold without possessing the same DK21 Kumar Deepak 1,34,63,88,628 1,34,40,63,404 1,19,58,41,419 RK36 Kumar Ranjit     75,07,45,984 19,04,66,684 3,50,66,856 MK11 Mukesh Kumar  1,88,10,46,533 6,77,89,919 3,86,87,311 SK24 Sanjeet Kumar 1,96,68,43,176 6,91,29,502 3,89,17,999  Total   1,30,85,13,585.00   14. During the investigation, the statements of Deepak Kumar and Ranjit Kumar, two of the above named employees, were recorded. As per their submissions, these employees had been working in the capacity of field boy/ peon/ pantry boy inOrder in the matter of Amrapali Aadya Trading & Investments Pvt. Ltd. & Ors               Page 16 of 76  AATIPL. They further submitted that they had neither traded in the securities market nor had any knowledge of trading account having been opened in their names. They also stated that they had not entered into any financial transaction with the company and had not received any funds in their account except for salary. From the same, it was apparent that the aforesaid employees did not have the financial ability to carry out such large quantum of trading and neither were they owners of the securities which were sold through their trading account. Therefore, it was alleged that the trading accounts of the said employees were merely used as a conduit by AATIPL for selling clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities for its own benefit.   15. In the above regard, I note that the recorded statement of the employees, Deepak Kumar and Ranjit Kumar, who had sold shares amounting to Rs.119.58 Crores and Rs.3.50 Crores without possessing the same, are available as Annexure 2 & 3 of the SCN. From the said statement, I note that the said employees have clearly submitted that they were working as pantry / field boy / peon with AATIPL and had not executed the alleged transactions in their account. I further note from the said statements that on specifically being asked whether they were aware that any trading account was opened in their name with AATIPL, the said employees categorically denied having any knowledge. I note that Ranjeet Kumar in his statement has stated - \\\\\\\\u201cNo, I have no knowledge. In 2010, I was made to sign a form. Sanjeeva Sinha had asked him to sign. I have studied till class 8. IOrder in the matter of Amrapali Aadya Trading & Investments Pvt. Ltd. & Ors               Page 17 of 76  have no knowledge of trading (translated from Hindi)\\\\\\\\u201d. Similarly, Deepak Kumar in his recorded statement has stated - \\\\\\\\u201cNo, I have no knowledge. I used to sign wherever I was told to sign. I am 10th pass. I have no knowledge of these things (translated from Hindi).\\\\\\\\u201d I further note that Deepak Kumar had also submitted a copy of his ID Card with AATIPL which showed his designation as \\\\\\\\u2018Field-Executive\\\\\\\\u2019. From the above observations, it is clear that the securities sold through the accounts of the abovementioned employees did not belong to them. Apart from the above, I also note that Sanjeeva Sinha, the MD of AATIPL, in his statement recorded before SEBI on 11/08/2017 has admitted that \\\\\\\\u201cSome of the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 stocks were sold off in the company. These stocks were sold off through some of the employees\\\\\\\\u2019 account and the loss of the company was covered, which were mainly due to clients\\\\\\\\u2019 debit, branch expansion and interest payment to clients.\\\\\\\\u201d Considering the fact that the abovementioned employees have admitted that the securities sold through their accounts did not belong to them and also the fact that Sanjeeva Sinha, MD of AATIPL, has admitted that securities of some of the clients were sold, it is clear that the securities sold through the accounts of the abovementioned employees belonged to other clients.  Pledge of Securities with Banks / NBFCs / FIs  16. As per the findings of investigation, analysis of demat statements of AATIPL and ACPL showed regular movement of securities between client beneficiary accountOrder in the matter of Amrapali Aadya Trading & Investments Pvt. Ltd. & Ors               Page 18 of 76  and own / business account of AATIPL. It was observed that the broker had raised funds by way of pledging the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities with Banks / FIs, viz. Axis Bank Ltd. (Axis), Globe Fincap Ltd. (GFL) and ECL Finance Ltd. (ECL). As per the submissions made by Axis, GFL and ECL during investigation, the outstanding position against pledge as on March 31, 2017 was as under:               Table : Pledge details Sl. No. Name of the entity Outstanding position  Stock value 1 Axis Bank Ltd. 18,549,252.00  37,098,504.00  2 Globe Fincap Ltd. (GFL) 181,957,124.00  22,345,584.00  3 ECL Finance Ltd. 315,758,925.00  621,514,020.00   Total 516,265,301.00  680,958,108.00   17. From the above table, it was observed that as on March 31, 2017, securities worth Rs. 68 crores were pledged by AATIPL with the aforesaid bank / FIs and the total outstanding against them was Rs 51.63 crores. An analysis of the bank statements of AATIPL revealed several entries of receipts and payments from / to the aforesaid Bank / FIs in broker\\\\\\\\u2019s Own / Business Bank A/c nos. 909020031142977, 000705028003 14422000000372, with Axis Bank, ICICI and HDFC Bank respectively. The same indicated that the broker was pledging securities with these Bank / FIs on regular basis.    18. In response to an enquiry regarding the ownership of the pledged securities, GFL had submitted that the pledging was done by AATIPL through its demat a/c no. 1205920000000211. It was observed that the aforesaid demat a/c was the \\\\\\\\u2018clientOrder in the matter of Amrapali Aadya Trading & Investments Pvt. Ltd. & Ors               Page 19 of 76  beneficiary\\\\\\\\u2019 account held in the name of AATIPL with the DP AATIPL. Since the \\\\\\\\u2018client beneficiary account\\\\\\\\u2019 contains the securities belonging to the clients, it was clear that the securities pledged with GFL belonged to the clients.  19. As regards pledging with ECL and Axis, these entities had submitted that pledging was carried out by way of marking pledge in the AATIPL\\\\\\\\u2019s demat a/c no. 1205920000002692. It was observed that the aforesaid demat a/c was the pledge account held in the name of AATIPL. In addition, these entities also submitted that AATIPL had submitted an undertaking with them mentioning that the securities which are being pledged are absolute property of AATIPL and same is unencumbered. However, the investigation revealed that in reality, the pledged securities belonged to the clients, since it was clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities which were transferred from the client beneficiary account to AATIPL\\\\\\\\u2019s own accounts for pledging, as explained below.  20. For pledging the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities with ECL and Axis, AATIPL used to transfer the securities from its client beneficiary account no. 1205920000000211 to its own pledge account no. 1205920000002692. Thereafter, in case of pledge with ECL, the pledge used to be set up in favour of a/c no. 1203230000060781 (DP a/c maintained by AATIPL with ECL DP). Similarly, in case of pledge with Axis bank, after transfer of shares from \\\\\\\\u2018client beneficiary account to its own pledge account, AATIPL used to set up pledge in favour of a/c no 1302750000000281 (DP a/c maintained by AATIPL with Axis DP). Further, at the time of un-pledge,Order in the matter of Amrapali Aadya Trading & Investments Pvt. Ltd. & Ors               Page 20 of 76  the securities were transferred/released back to the source a/c i.e. client beneficiary demat a/c no. 1205920000000211. The same indicated that the securities being pledged by AATIPL with GFL, ECL and Axis, actually belonged to clients since the same were being taken out of \\\\\\\\u2018Client Beneficiary Account\\\\\\\\u2019 prior to the pledge and were being returned to the same place after unpledged. It was thus alleged that AATIPL had not only failed to maintain segregation between own and clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities but also misused the client\\\\\\\\u2019s securities by pledging / transferring the same to the NBFCs.  21. As it was found that AATIPL had siphoned off clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities by pledging them with Banks / FIs and selling them through employee\\\\\\\\u2019 accounts, in order to ascertain the position of securities available with the broker, the depositories were advised to provide the holding and valuation statements of all demat accounts held by AATIPL as on August 10, 2017. Further, the value of securities as per the Register of Securities maintained by AATIPL was obtained from NSE. It was observed that client securities amounting to Rs. 411.3 crores recorded in the back office books as on August 10, 2017 were not available in the beneficiary accounts of AATIPL or with the clearing member. Details of the same are provided in the table below: Table 16: Details of securities Sr. No. Particular Value in Rs.

As per the Bank Statement analysis the following details are observed.   S.No. Details Particulars 1 Account Name Green Money Solution 2 Bank Name/Payment Gateway Bandhan Bank 3 Account Number 10200001064442 4 IFSC Code  SBIN0012823 5 Branch Code 12823 6 Date of Account Opening 15/07/2020 7 Bank Statement Period 15/07/2020 to 13/05/2021 8 No. of Credit Transaction 1098 (nos) 9 Date of last Credit 03/04/2021__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s. Green Money Solution and its Proprietor Mr. Arvind Patidar                      Page 8 of 19                                10 Total Credit  Rs. 46,52,170.83/-.  14. As per the bank statement analysis, amounts were frequently deposited till December 24, 2020, after which though there are withdrawal transaction in February 2021, however, there is one credit entry noted again on April 03, 2021.  15. On the basis of activities carried by the GMS, it is observed that the amounts credited into the Bandhan bank account on a preponderance of probability basis, are towards investment advisory services.  16. Further, it was noted that all four payment transactions made by the complainant Mr. Amit Singh towards the services of GMS dated August 14, 2020 August 27, 2020, September 14, 2020 and September 16, 2020, for the amount of Rs.5,000, Rs.10,000, Rs.19,048 and Rs. 30,000 have been reconciled in the Bandhan bank statement of GMS. 17. In light of the aforesaid, I prima facie find that GMS has put information in public domain / advertising by using website, namely, www.greenmoneysolution.com about the various advisory services offered by it in securities market. It is also observed that various products / plans / packages are being offered by GMS to avail their services. Thus, it is observed, that GMS is holding itself out as an Investment Adviser. In view of the above facts and circumstances, content on the active website coupled with credits details in the Bandhan bank account and total credit to the tune of Rs. 46,52, 170.83/- in a span of just six (6) months, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees / funds credited to the Bandhan bank account, were for the purpose of availing the product services/packages indicated on the website of GMS and it is acting as an investment advisor in securities market since July 15, 2020 (opening of the bank account and registration of website) to till date.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s. Green Money Solution and its Proprietor Mr. Arvind Patidar                      Page 9 of 19                                18. In this regard, I have perused the definition of investment Adviser as given in regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, which states that investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment Adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have also perused the Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines investment advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d  19. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is, prima facie noted, from the activity of GMS, and receipt of funds in its bank account, that it is holding itself out as Investment Adviser by offering to provide services related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is offering various investment packages for subscription and these services fall within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advice\\\\\\\\u201d under Regulation 2(l) and investment Adviser services as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations. Therefore, GMS has not only held itself out as Investment Adviser but has also acted as an Investment Adviser for consideration.   Issue No 2:  If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether M/s. Green Money Solution and its proprietor Mr. Arvind Patidar have, prima facie, violated any provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) read with SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (\\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d)   20. In order to ensure that investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s. Green Money Solution and its Proprietor Mr. Arvind Patidar                      Page 10 of 19                                the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, states that  \\\\\\\\u201cNo  stock  broker,  sub -broker,  share  transfer  agent,  banker  to  an  issue,  trustee  of  trust deed,  registrar  to  an  issue,  merchant  banker,  underwriter,  portfolio  manager,  investment Adviser  and  such  other  intermediary  who  may  be  associated  with  securities  market  shall  buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration  obtained  from  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the regulations  made under  this Act\\\\\\\\u201d  21. Further, Regulation 3(1) of the IA regulations, states that \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an Investment Adviser or hold itself out as an investment Adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.   Provided that a person acting as an investment adviser immediately before the commencement of these regulations may continue to do so for a period of six months from such commencement or, if it has made an application for a certificate under sub-regulation (2) within the said period of six months, till the disposal of such application.\\\\\\\\u201d 22. Thus, as per Section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Regulation 3(1) of IA Regulations, any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI regulations, i.e. the registration of the investment Advisers is mandatory.   23. The activities of Noticees as brought out from the materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions shows that, the Noticee is holding itself out as Investment Adviser and is acting as Investment Adviser. However, no material was available on record to indicate that GMS or its proprietor Mr. Arvind Patidar, in their individual capacity had a certificate of registration as an Investment Adviser. In this context, it is noted that GMS and its proprietor Mr. Arvind Patidar in their individual capacity are not registered with SEBI in any capacity. The characteristics and__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s. Green Money Solution and its Proprietor Mr. Arvind Patidar                      Page 11 of 19                                features of the business activity carried out by the Noticees, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, leads to the conclusion that the Noticee is holding itself out and acting as investment adviser without a certificate of registration from SEBI.  24. Further in my view, an unregistered investment adviser like GMS, can put investors at great risk. Without having a registered investment adviser certificate, the Noticees is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients with the objective of making money/collecting fees through various services, products and packages. Further, the Noticees has put in information in public domain / advertising by using website about investment in securities market and offering services on subscription model. 25. It is noted that, prima facie, activities / conduct / act / practice of the GMS as discussed above are, prima facie, in violation of provisions of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, read with regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.   Issue No. 3:  If answers to Issue Nos. 1 & 2 are affirmative, who are responsible for the violations?   26. I note that Mr. Arvind Patidar is the sole proprietor running the business in the name of GMS. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in Ashok Transport Agency vs. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that, \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business. A suit by or against a proprietary concern is by or against the proprietor of the business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d. 27. Therefore, I find that Mr. Arvind Patidar is liable for the aforesaid prima facie violations of SEBI Act, IA Regulations__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s. Green Money Solution and its Proprietor Mr. Arvind Patidar                      Page 12 of 19                                Issue No. 4:  If answer to Issue No. 2 is in affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any should be issued against those responsible for the violations?   28.  SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of regulating investment advisory activities to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of investment advisory activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations inter alia seek to create a structure within which Investment Advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment Advisers to comply with the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market.  29. In the instant case, it is noted that Noticees are soliciting and inducing the investors to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips, intra-day calls etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration as mandated under the IA Regulations. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Noticees, from giving services and collecting any more fees from the public and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. It is noted from material available on record that, transaction took place in the Bandhan bank account of Noticees as recently as in the month of April 2021. Moreover, the website of the Noticees is active and available to the public at large. The threat of the investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Noticees through the website in the securities market is continuing and imminent. The total amount of money, observed to have been collected by the__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s. Green Money Solution and its Proprietor Mr. Arvind Patidar                      Page 13 of 19                                noticees is Rs. 46,52,170.83 since opening of the account in July 15, 2020, till December 24, 2020, i.e. within a span of 6 months. The above indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors. 30. It is noted that, permitting the investors to receive investment advisory services from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from the unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving service from unregistered investment advisor not in consonance with the IA Regulations vis-a-vis an investor who receives such service from registered investment Adviser following the IA Regulations stands in a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as investor as envisaged under the IA regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not even satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment Adviser. Availing of service from such person is detrimental to investors and such unqualified service can result in irreparable detriment as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victim of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury to the development of the securities market also qualifies as \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable detriment\\\\\\\\u201d as the objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market.  31. Further, if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may subscribe by parting with significant fees and may cause irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is right of the current entity herein visa-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the \\\\\\\\u201cex-parte orders in the case of private suits\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cex-parte public enforcement actions\\\\\\\\u201d, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s. Green Money Solution and its Proprietor Mr. Arvind Patidar                      Page 14 of 19                                \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential loss of investment by the investors by following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if prima facie unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing an exparte-interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favour of Noticees.   32. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Noticees from collecting any more funds from the public and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. It is noted in the preceding paragraphs, monies being frequently credited in the bank account since July 15, 2020, till December 24, 2020, with the latest credit entry in April 2021 and the website of the Noticees continuing to be active. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Noticees in the securities market and loss of potential money invested and fees paid, is still in existence and imminent.  33. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Noticees is approximately Rs. 46,52,170.83 within a span of just 6 months, this indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors. In light of the same, I find that there is no other alternative but to take recourse through an interim ex-parte order against Noticees for preventing them from collecting funds   by indulging in unauthorized investment advisory services without obtaining the mandatory registrations from SEBI in accordance with the law. The latest credit in the bank__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s. Green Money Solution and its Proprietor Mr. Arvind Patidar                      Page 15 of 19                                statements of the Noticees is in April 2021 and the website of the Noticees continues to be active, which prima facie, shows that the investors may still continue to make payment for the services of the Noticees, the balance of convenience demands the preventive measure of stopping the collection of money in the above-mentioned bank account from investors. The same can be effectively achieved by an appropriate direction of stopping credit into the abovementioned bank account. As Noticees have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, the balance of convenience also demands that Noticees have to be prevented from diverting the funds collected from the investors through   unauthorized investment advisory activity. Accordingly, an appropriate direction stopping the debit from the above-mentioned bank account may also be incorporated.   34. With the initiation of quasi-judicial proceedings, given the fact that Noticees have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, it is possible that Noticees may divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients. The same may result in defeating the effective implementation of the direction of refund, if any, to be passed after deciding the matter on merits. It therefore becomes necessary for SEBI to take urgent steps to prevent Noticees from diverting the money collected from the subscribers / clients. It is also essential to take urgent steps to prevent them from alienating any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets, so that the final remedies, if any, do not become infructuous. In view of the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove, and considering the interests of already existing clients of Noticees and also the interests of those who may fall prey to the unregistered investment advisory by reaching Noticees through the active website or any other mode, the balance of convenience lies against the Noticees, which requires immediate action against them including not to divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients / investors.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of M/s.

In respect of   Mankind Vintrade Private Limited (PAN: AAGCM8618P)          CIN No: U52190WB2010PTC155315          (Currently known as Kurjha Vintrade Private Limited)  14 Hare Street, Ground Floor, Kolkata 700001  In the matter of   Mystic Electronics Limited    BACKGROUND OF THE CASE  1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) received a reference from the Office of Director General of Income Tax (Investigation), Delhi vide letter dated February 2, 2015 alleging manipulation in the scrip of Mystic Electronics Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cCompany\\\\\\\\u201d/ \\\\\\\\u201cMEL\\\\\\\\u201d). Based on the same, SEBI conducted an investigation to determine whether any act or omission by certain entities amounted to manipulation in the scrip of MEL through their trades by indulging in executing the trades in the scrip above the Last Traded Price (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cLTP\\\\\\\\u201d) during the period March 19, 2013 to March 31, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cinvestigation period\\\\\\\\u201d). Pursuant to the completion of the investigation, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings  in respect of certain entities, including Mankind Vintrade Private Limited (currently known as Kurjha Vintrade Private Limited and hereafter referredPage 2 of 8 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) under the provisions of section 15 HA of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) for its alleged violation of the provisions of regulation 3(a) (b), (c), (d) and regulation 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (e) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  2. In the said matter, the undersigned was initially appointed as the Adjudicating Officer by SEBI vide order dated July 4, 2016 under section 15 I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAdjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge the aforementioned allegations leveled against the Noticee under the provisions of section 15 HA of the SEBI Act. Pursuant to the transfer of the undersigned to another department of SEBI, Dr. Anitha Anoop was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, vide order dated March 18, 2019. Subsequently, due to the transfer of Dr. Anitha Anoop, the undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, vide communique dated November 3, 2020.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  3. Show Cause Notice dated December 20, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee under Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules to show-cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against the Noticee and penalty be not imposed on it  under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act for the alleged violation of the provisions of Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a) and (e) of PFUTP Regulations committed by the Noticee. The details in respect of the violation / non-compliance by the Noticee as observed from the SCN are as given below: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is alleged that a scheme was devised by MEL, the operators and the connected entities, including the Noticee by allotting shares on preferential allotment basis to various entities. It is alleged that thePage 3 of 8 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited connected entities, including the Noticee increased the scrip price of MEL by placing the buy orders in the scrip at a price higher than the last traded price and also by absorbing the sell orders that were available in the market which were placed at a higher price than the Last Traded Price (LTP) in MEL. Once the scrip price of MEL reached the desired level, the preferential allottees exited and the preferential allottees have allegedly made a profit of Rs. 39 crore. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is observed that MEL made a preferential allotment of 92,30,000 shares to 48 entities on June 7, 2013 to raise an amount of Rs. 56.06 crore and the shares were under lock-in period for one year upto June 06, 2014. It is observed that the shares were allotted on preferential basis initially at Rs. 25 per share and subsequently, the same was revised to Rs. 60.74 (based on 26 week average price).  Post lock-in period, it was observed that 14 allottees who were allotted shares in the preferential allotment have either fully or partly sold their holdings in MEL i.e. 86,71,828 shares were sold in patches (i.e these shares were sold after the stock split period and approximately 9.30% of the shares allotted through the preferential allotment were sold by the preferential allottees for a value of Rs. 39 crore). Once the preferential allottees  started to exit after they sold the shares, the scrip price of MEL started to decline substantially. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 During the investigation period, it is observed that a total of 1629 entities had traded in the scrip of MEL, out of which 60 entities were observed to be connected to the operators and also to the promoter/director of MEL. These connections were established during the course of the investigations on the basis of common address, email id, companies/directors related to the operators and through off market transfers. (hereinafter referred to as \"Connected entities\"). \\\\\\\\uf0b7 From the LTP (Last traded price) analysis and Trade/order log carried out during the period when the scrip price of MEL had witnessed sharp rise i.e the patch 1 of the investigation period, it is observed that the entities related to the company/ operators were the major contributors to the LTP in the Price Rise Patch and contributed substantially to the price rise of the scrip by entering into transactions at prices higher than the last traded price. ByPage 4 of 8 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited carrying out such trades repeatedly, the connected entities established price higher than the last traded price to increase the price of the scrip during the price rise patch. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is alleged that the connected entities, including Noticee have contributed to the price rise of Rs. 1550.1 (net LTP) compared to the market Net LTP of Rs. 489.45. Further, it is observed that only 35 connected entities (of 60 entities) have contributed to positive LTP of Rs. 2777.80 which is 47% to market Positive LTP (Rs. 5875.95) in 2642 trades for a total volume of 11,44,294 shares. Further, the connected entities, bought 11.55 lac shares which is 40.79% of the market volume (price rise-Patch I) and contributed to 47% of market positive LTP. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is observed that the Noticee is one of the top 10 connected entities who contributed to the Positive LTP. The details regarding the trades of the Noticee in MEL during the investigation period is as under: Client Name Operator Net LTP Positive LTP Negative LTP Zero LTP % of +ve LTP to total market +ve LTP Net LTP (in Rs.) Traded qnty No. of trades +ve LTP (in Rs.) Traded qnty No. of trades Negative LTP (in Rs.) Traded qnty No. of trades Zero LTP traded quantity No. of trades Mankind Vintrade Pvt. Ltd. Devesh Upadhyay 27 5000 5 34 825 1 -7 350 2 3825 2 0.58  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is alleged that the connected entities, including the Noticee repeatedly traded and contributed to the price rise in the scrip of MEL during the period March, 2013 to August, 2014 by placing buy orders at a higher price than the last traded price. Further, it is alleged that  the top 10 connected entities carried out 346 trades during the price rise patch of which in 283 trades, the sell order were placed first. The connected entities, including the Noticee placed the buy orders and absorbed the sell orders and increased the scrip price during the pre-split period i.e patch 1 of the investigation period. It is observed that in 135 trading days during the price rise period, (out of total 326 trading days) daily average volume of 750 shares and trades of 5 trades were carried out in the scrip of MEL. Thus, with insignificant trades and average volume, artificial demand in the scrip of MEL was created by placing the buy orders at a price higher than the lastPage 5 of 8 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited traded price in the scrip. It is alleged that the scrip price of MEL was inflated and manipulated. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Thus, it is alleged that during the period when the scrip price of MEL witnessed increase, the connected entities, including the Noticee had contributed to the artificial price rise in the scrip of MEL by absorbing the sell orders that were available in the market which was at a higher price than the LTP which is evident from the net LTP of the connected entities that is much higher than the net LTP of market. These entities, including the Noticee created misleading appearance of price movement and attracted other investors which resulted in further price rise. The connected entities created artificial price rise and interest, thereby inducing other investors to trade in the scrip. Thereafter, once the price reached the desired level, the preferential allottees exited at a higher price and thereby booked profits. 4. The Show Cause Notice dated December 20, 2016 issued to the Noticee returned undelivered with the remark \\\\\\\\u201cno company\\\\\\\\u2019s signboard, letterbox and naming plate at this address and no mention the room no, hence not known\\\\\\\\u201d. In the interest of natural justice, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on July 3, 2019, vide letter dated April 30, 2019. The said letter could not be affixed at the last known address of the Noticee as the company was not found. Thereafter, the email address of the Noticee was obtained from the website of MCA and another opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticee on August 19, 2020 vide email dated August 4, 2020 by the erstwhile Adjudicating Officer. However, no one appeared on the scheduled date of hearing on behalf of the Noticee. Thereafter, pursuant to my appointment as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on January 21, 2021. However, neither the hearing notice could be affixed at the last known address of the Noticee nor the email could be delivered to the email addresses of the Noticee which was obtained from the MCA website. Thereafter, in terms of the adjudication rules, a public notice was made in the newspapers viz. the Times of India, Kolkata edition and Bartaman on April 9, 2021 wherein the Noticee was intimated about the fact that a copy of the SCNPage 6 of 8 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited dated December 20, 2016 issued to it has been uploaded on the website of SEBI and the Noticee was advised to appear for a personal hearing before the Adjudicating Officer on April 30, 2021. However, it is on record that no one appeared on behalf of the Noticee on the stipulated date of hearing.  5. Thereafter, during the course of the proceedings, the status of the Noticee was ascertained from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) website. It was observed that the name of the Noticee has been changed to Kurjha Vintrade Private Limited and it has been struck- off from the list of companies by the Registrar of Companies, Kolkata (RoC) as on August 24, 2018. To confirm the same, an email dated June 28, 2021 was sent to RoC, Kolkata to ascertain the factual position. RoC, Kolkata vide email dated June 30, 2021 confirmed that Noticee had changed its name to Kurjha Vintrade Pvt. Ltd. on February 5, 2017 and it has been struck off from the list of companies by the RoC on August 24, 2018.  As per the Public Notice (Form No. STK-7), which was attached with the said email, a list of 7145 companies were attached as per the Notification issued by RoC, Kolkata in terms of sub-section (5) of section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013. I find that the name of the Noticee was mentioned in the said list (at sl.no. 3398 under CIN No U52190WB2010PTC155315). The Notification, inter alia, mentioned the following: \\\\\\\\u201cNotice is hereby published that pursuant to sub-section (5) of Section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013 the names of 7145 no. of Companies as per list attached as Annexure \\\\\\\\u201cA\\\\\\\\u201d have this day i.e. 24th day of August, 2018 been struck off from the register of companies and the said companies are dissolved.\\\\\\\\u201d   6. It is an established fact that when a company\\\\\\\\u2019s name is struck-off from the RoC list and the company is also dissolved, then it is a non-existing company and the adjudication proceedings against the non-existing company is thus nullity. In this context, I would like to draw reference to a judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) vs Vived Marketing Services (P) Ltd., ITA NO. 273/2009 dated September 17, 2009 in which it was held that - \\\\\\\\u201cWhen the Assessing Officer passed the orderPage 7 of 8 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited of assessment against the respondent company, it had already been dissolved and struck off by the register of the Registrar of companies under Section 560 of the Companies Act. In these circumstances, the Tribunal rightly held that there could not have been any assessment order passed against the company which was not in existence as on that date in the eyes of law it had already been dissolved. We are of the opinion that the view taken by the Tribunal is perfectly valid and in accordance with law.\\\\\\\\u201d   7. Further, Black\\\\\\\\u2019s Law Dictionary explains \\\\\\\\u2018dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 as termination or winding up. It further clarifies that the dissolution of a corporation is the termination of its legal existence. Strike off essentially means removing the name of the company from the Register maintained by the Registrar of Companies. It is like closure of the company and the company will not be in existence after being struck- off from the ROC list and it cannot perform any operations.  8. In the context of the alleged manipulation in the scrip of the company for the above referred investigation period, I note that in exercise of its powers conferred under sections 11(1), 11(4) & 11 B of the SEBI Act, an order dated June 26, 2020 against the Noticee has been passed by SEBI restraining the Noticee from accessing the securities market. Vide the said order, the Noticee was also prohibited from accessing the securities market, directly or indirectly, and also restrained from buying, selling or dealing in securities including units of mutual funds, either directly or indirectly or in any other manner whatsoever, for a period of one year.  9. Therefore, in view of the facts and circumstances noted in the preceding paragraphs and also the fact that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been struck-off from the RoC list and also \\\\\\\\u2018dissolved\\\\\\\\u2019 as on August 24, 2018 as per the RoC notification, I conclude that the present adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee vide SCN dated December 20, 2016 cannot be proceeded with.Page 8 of 8 In the matter of Mystic Electronics Limited ORDER  10. In view of the above observations/findings and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against the Noticee viz. Mankind Vintrade Private Limited  (name changed to Kurjha Vintrade Private Limited).  11. In terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, copies of this order are sent to the Noticee, viz., Mankind Vintrade Private Limited. (currently known as Kurjha Vintrade Private Limited) and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

In respect of: Aakarshan Dealers Private Limited PAN No: AAJCA4948F 912, Lal Bazar Street, Kolkata-700001  In the matter of                                                                                    Dealing in illiquid stock options at BSE FACTS OF THE CASE 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) observed large scale reversal of trades in the Stock Options segment of the Bombay Stock Exchange (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018BSE\\\\\\\\u2019) leading to the alleged creation of artificial volume in the stock options segment .In this regard, SEBI conducted an investigation into the trading activity in the illiquid Stock Options segment at BSE for the period April 01, 2014 to September 30, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Investigation Period\\\\\\\\u2019).  2. It was observed during the course of investigation that a total of 2,91,643 trades comprising 81.38% of all the trades executed in the Stock Options Segment at BSE during the investigation period were trades which involved reversal of buy and sell positions by the clients and counterparties in a contract on the same day. It was also observed that the aforesaid trades resulted into alleged creation of artificial volume to the tune of 826.21 crore units or 54.68% of the total market volume in the Stock Options segment of BSE during the investigation period. In view of the large scale reversal of trades that were observed in the illiquid Stock Options segment at BSE, it is alleged that these trades were non-genuine in nature.___________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication order in respect of Aakarshan Dealers Private Limited in the matter of Illiquid Stock Options at BSE  Page 2 of 5  3. It was observed that Aakarshan Dealers Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019) was one of the various entities which had indulged in the execution of the non-genuine trades in the Stock Options Segment at BSE during the above referred investigation period. It was observed that Noticee had entered into reversal trades with its counterparties which involved squaring off transactions with significant difference in sell value and buy value of the transactions. It was therefore alleged that Noticee had executed the reversal trades, which were non-genuine in nature and have created false or misleading appearance of trading in terms of creation of artificial volume in the Stock Options segment at BSE and therefore, it is alleged that the Noticee has violated the provisions of regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and regulation 4(1), 4(2) (a) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trading Practices relating to Securities Markets) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018PFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019). In view of the above reasons, adjudication proceedings have been initiated against the Noticee under the provisions of section 15 HA of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2019). APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 4. The undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer, vide communique dated April 26, 2021 under section 19 read with section 15-I of the SEBI Act read with rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions of section 15HA of the SEBI Act the aforementioned alleged violation of the provisions of law by the Noticee.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, HEARING AND REPLY 5. Show Cause Notice ref. SEBI/HO/EAD/EAD1/SBM/ASR/10656/1/2021 dated May 17, 2021 (hereinafter referred to as 'SCN') was issued to the Noticee in terms of rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules requiring the Noticee to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against it and why penalty, if any, should not be imposed on the Noticee under the provisions of section 15HAof the SEBI Act  6. The SCN issued to the Noticee, inter alia, mentioned/alleged the following- a. It is observed from the trade log of the Noticee that it had entered into non-genuine trades in 2 contracts wherein it executed a total of 8 trades all of which were, prima facie, non-genuine trades.___________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication order in respect of Aakarshan Dealers Private Limited in the matter of Illiquid Stock Options at BSE  Page 3 of 5  b. The total volume of 8,14,000 units generated by the Noticee in these 2 contracts due to its alleged non-genuine trades was artificial volume generated by the Noticee in the stock option segment of BSE. These alleged non-genuine trades, executed by Noticee in above contracts, had significant differential in buy rates and sell rates considering that the trades were reversed on same day. CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 7. I find that the Show Cause Notice dated May 17, 2021 which was issued to the Noticee had returned undelivered with remark \\\\\\\\u201cinsufficient address\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, during the course of the proceeding, the status/address of the Noticee was ascertained from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) website. It was observed that the name of the Noticee has been struck off from the list of companies by the Registrar of Companies, Kolkata (RoC) as on June 29, 2018. As per the Public Notice (Form No. STK-5), which was downloaded from the MCA website, a list of 10,650 companies were attached as per the Notification issued by ROC, Kolkata in terms of sub-section (1) of section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013. I find that the name of the Noticee was mentioned in the said list (at sl.no. 5488 under CIN No U52190WB2011PTC162362). The Notification downloaded from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India, (www.mca.gov.in) website inter alia, mentioned the following: \\\\\\\\u201cIn the matter of striking off of companies under section 248 (1) of the Companies Act, 2013 of the following Companies in Annexure - \"A\", 1. Notice is hereby given that the Registrar of Companies has a reasonable cause to believe that \\\\\\\\u2013 The following companies mentioned in Annexure - \"Am (List of 10,650 nos. of companies enclosed) have not been carrying on any business or operation for a period of two immediately preceding financial years and have not made any application within such period for obtaining the status of dormant company under section 455 of the Companies Act, 2013.  And, therefore, proposes to remove/strike off the names of the above mentioned companies ii-om the register of companies and dissolve them unless a cause is shown to the contrary, within thirty days from the date of this notice. 2. Any person objecting to the proposed removal/striking off of name of the companies from the register of companies may send &/her objection to the office address mentioned here above within thirty days from the date of publication of this notice.___________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication order in respect of Aakarshan Dealers Private Limited in the matter of Illiquid Stock Options at BSE  Page 4 of 5  8. Further, the details of the Noticee as mentioned by it in the Annual Return ( Form No. MGT-7) filed by the Noticee with  ROC in terms of section 92 of the Companies Act, 2013 was verified with the Master Data as available on the MCA website and  in this regard, the following observations are made: a. The PAN details of the Noticee matched with the CIN number mentioned in the MCA database. b. Form No. MGT-7 and Company Master Data of MCA contains the same email id of the Noticee i.e., rocwork1234@gmail.com c. Form No. MGT-7 and Company Master Data of MCA captured the same date of incorporation of the Company/ Noticee which is June 05, 2011 d. Form No. MGT-7 and Company Master Data of MCA depicts same Authorised Capital and Paid up Capital which is \\\\\\\\u20b922,00,000/- and \\\\\\\\u20b921,63,250/-, respectively.  In view of the above and also the observations made in the STK-5 report, which is discussed above, it is clear that the name of the Noticee has been stuck- off from the ROC list w.e.f June 29, 2016 and the Noticee also stands dissolved from the said date.   9. It is an established fact that when a company\\\\\\\\u2019s name is struck-off from the RoC list and the company is also dissolved, then it is a non-existing company and the adjudication proceedings against the non-existing company is thus nullity. In this context, I would like to draw reference to a judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in the matter of Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) vs Vived Marketing Services (P) Ltd., ITA NO. 273/2009 dated September 17, 2009 in which it was held that - \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026When the Assessing Officer passed the order of assessment against the respondent company, it had already been dissolved and struck off the register of the Registrar of companies under Section 560 of the Companies Act. In these circumstances, the Tribunal rightly held that there could not have been any assessment order passed against the company which was not in existence as on that date in the eyes of law it had already been dissolved. We are of the opinion that the view taken by the Tribunal is perfectly valid and in accordance with law.\\\\\\\\u201d  10. Further, Black\\\\\\\\u2019s Law Dictionary explains \\\\\\\\u2018dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 as termination or winding up. It further clarifies that the dissolution of a corporation is the termination of its legal existence. Strike off essentially means removing the name of the company from the Register maintained by the Registrar of Companies. It is like closure of the company and the company will not be in existence after being struck-off and cannot perform any operations.___________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication order in respect of Aakarshan Dealers Private Limited in the matter of Illiquid Stock Options at BSE  Page 5 of 5   11. I also note that as on the date of issuance of the SCN to the Noticee i.e May 17, 2021, the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been stuck-off from the ROC list and the company was not in existence.  Therefore, in view of the facts and circumstances noted in the preceding paragraphs and also the fact that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been struck-off from the RoC list and also \\\\\\\\u2018dissolved\\\\\\\\u2019 as on June 29, 2018 as per the RoC notification, I conclude that the present adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee vide SCN dated December 20, 2016 cannot be proceeded with. ORDER 12. In view of the above observations/findings and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against the Noticee viz. Aakarshan Dealers Private Limited vide SCN dated May 17, 2021.  13. In terms of rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to SEBI.

In respect of: AAY JAY Consultants & Investment Private Limited PAN:AACCA0949F  103, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata \\\\\\\\u2013 700007 In the matter of  Dealings in illiquid stock options at BSE FACTS OF THE CASE  1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) observed large scale reversal of trades in the Stock Options segment of Bombay Stock Exchange (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018BSE\\\\\\\\u2019) leading to alleged creation of artificial volume in the stock options segment. In this regard, SEBI conducted an investigation into the trading activity in the illiquid Stock Options Segment at BSE for the period April 01, 2014 to September 30, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d). 2. It was observed during the course of investigation that a total of 2,91,643 trades comprising 81.38% of all the trades executed in the Stock Options Segment at BSE during the investigation period were trades which involved reversal of buy and sell positions by the clients and counterparties in a contract on the same day. It was also observed that the aforesaid trades resulted into alleged creation of artificial volume to the tune of 826.21 crore units or 54.68% of the total market volume in the Stock  Adjudication Order in the matter of Dealings in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 2 of 23     Options segment of BSE during the investigation period. In view of the large scale reversal of trades that were observed in the illiquid Stock Options segment at BSE, it is alleged that these trades were non-genuine in nature.  3. It was observed that AAY JAY Consultants & Investment Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) was one of the various entities which indulged in the execution of non-genuine trades in the Stock Options Segment at BSE during the above referred investigation period. It was observed that Noticee had entered into reversal trades with its counterparties which involved squaring off transactions with significant difference in sell value and buy value of the transactions. Therefore, it is alleged that Noticee had executed the reversal trades which were non-genuine in nature and have created false or misleading appearance of trading in terms of creation of artificial volume in the Stock Options segment at BSE and therefore, it is alleged that the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and Regulation 4(1), 4(2) (a) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trading Practices relating to Securities Markets) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). In view of the above reasons, adjudication proceedings have been initiated against the Noticee under the provisions of section 15 HA of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2019).  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 4. The undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer, vide order dated April 26, 2021 under Section 19 read with Section 15-I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions of section 15HA of the SEBI Act for the aforementioned alleged violation of the provisions of law by the Noticee.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, HEARING AND REPLY 5. Show Cause Notice ref. SEBI/HO/EAD1/SBM/KL/11809 dated June 08, 2021 (hereinafter referred to as 'SCN') was issued to the Noticee in terms of Rule 4 of the  Adjudication Order in the matter of Dealings in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 3 of 23     Adjudication Rules requiring the Noticee to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against it and why penalty, if any, should not be imposed on the Noticee under the provisions of section 15HA of the SEBI Act. The SCN issued to the Noticee, inter alia, mentioned the following-: i. It is noted that Noticee was one of the various entities which were indulged in execution of such alleged non-genuine trades in Stock Options Segment of BSE during the Investigation period. Following points deal with the dealings of Noticee during the Investigation period and allegations against it for execution of non-genuine trades. ii. For the purpose of illustration of non-genuine trades and creation of artificial volume by the Noticee, details of trading done by the Noticee in the contract viz. \\\\\\\\u201cNMDC15MAR150.00CEW3\\\\\\\\u201d on March 18, 2015 is given below:  Date Buyer Seller Buy Order Time  Sell Order Time Trade Time Trade Rate (Rs.) Trade Quantity 18/03/2015 AAYJAY CONSULTANTS & INVESTMENT PVT LTD KARTICK CHANDRA KUNDU 15:01:10.910892 14:57:03.514326 15:01:10.910892 0.5 2000 18/03/2015 AAYJAY CONSULTANTS & INVESTMENT PVT LTD KARTICK CHANDRA KUNDU 15:01:10.910892 14:57:26.670055 15:01:10.910892 1 60000 18/03/2015 KARTICK CHANDRA KUNDU AAYJAY CONSULTANTS & INVESTMENT PVT LTD 15:10:55.580615 15:06:01.232720 15:10:55.580615 0.05 66000 18/03/2015 AAYJAY CONSULTANTS & INVESTMENT PVT LTD KARTICK CHANDRA KUNDU 15:01:10.910892 14:57:32.449832 15:01:10.910892 0.95 4000 iii. It is observed from the table above that the trades entered by the Noticee in the contract of \\\\\\\\u201cNMDC15MAR150.00CEW3\\\\\\\\u201d on March 18, 2015, with its counterparty viz. Kartick Chandra Kundu were reversed between the Noticee and the same counterparty on the same day resulting in reversal of trades which are, prima facie, considered to be non-genuine. Therefore, in the process artificial volume in the stock option contract at BSE has been generated by the Noticee through such non-genuine trades. From the table above, it is observed that the artificial volume created as no. of units reversed in non-genuine trades is 1,32,000 shares comprising both volume of initial trade and volume of reversal trade, while not considering the volume which is not reversed. iv. It is further observed from the trade data of the Noticee that it has allegedly entered into non-genuine trades in 2 contracts wherein it executed a total of 10 trades all of which were, prima  Adjudication Order in the matter of Dealings in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 4 of 23     facie, non-genuine trades. In view of this, it is alleged that such fraudulent trades of the Noticee had resulted into creation of artificial volume of total 4,92,000 units. v. In this regard, details of all the alleged non-genuine trades of the Noticee in Stock Option Segment of BSE during relevant period are attached as Annexure B. From the perusal of the trade data of the alleged non-genuine trades of the Noticee, it is observed that Noticee has allegedly executed non-genuine trades in 2 contracts. The total volume of 4,92,000 units generated by the Noticee in these 2 contracts due to its alleged non-genuine trades was artificial volume generated by the Noticee in the stock option segment of BSE. These alleged non-genuine trades, executed by Noticee in above contracts, had significant differential in buy rates and sell rates considering that the trades were reversed on same day. vi. In view of the foregoing, it is alleged that the Noticee, by indulging in execution of reversal trades in Stock Options with same entities on the same day, which were non-genuine in nature, has created false or misleading appearance of trading in the aforementioned contracts traded in the option segment of BSE. In view of the fact that these options contracts were illiquid in nature, having very small volume in trading, the Noticee allegedly created artificial volumes in stock options which was manipulative and deceptive in nature. Therefore, in view of above, it is alleged that the Noticee has violated Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  6. Vide letters dated June 22, 2021 and July 22, 2021, Noticee submitted its reply to the SCN, details of which are given below:  Reply dated June 22, 2021 i. It is submitted that it is a matter of record that we had traded in two (2) weekly stock options contract on the options segment of BSE on 18/03/2015, namely NMDCC 3C 150, strike price 150, having expiry date of 19/03/2015 and also ANBKC3P65, strike price 65, also having expiry date of 19/03/2015. Both these weekly contracts had a life span of 5 days, starting from a Friday (13/3/2015 in this case) and ending on a Thursday 09/3/2015 in this case). Both these contracts Were heavily traded on 18/03/2015, the day we had traded in these contracts. Besides, a quantity of 16, 003000 was traded on 17/03/2015 in contract ANBKC3P 65 expiring on 19/03/2015. This voluminous trading shows that these were not \"illiquid\" contracts. Thus, it is submitted that the allegation that these options contracts were \"illiquid\" in nature is not factual, from the website of BSE is enclosed as Annexure \"A\" to substantiate above submission, ii) Besides the above ,the  Adjudication Order in the matter of Dealings in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 5 of 23     underlying Securities in the cash market ,namely NMDC Ltd and Andhra Bank Ltd were regularly traded in the cash market segment on BSE (as also on NSE) and the cash market volume in these underlying scrips during the pendency of these respective options contracts expiring on 19/03/2015 were as on BSE  Thus, not only the underlying securities in the Cash Market but also the derivative options contracts in these were fairly liquid and not illiquid in nature, and were not having \"very small volumes\". ii. It is further submitted that the impugned trades executed by us were neither manipulative, nor deceptive nor as alleged, as explained below : a. As is evident from records of our trades available with SEBI, orders in NMDC stock options contract were placed on 18/03/2015 between 14:57 and 15:01. This was at the far end of trading session ending at 15-30 hrs. Thus, price discovery in this options contract had already taken place during the trading day since Commencement of trading at 09:15 Hrs as the trading session was coming to a close in another 30 minutes. In case of any 'manipulative or deceptive practice adopted by us, the effect of such alleged practice, either in price or in volume, should have been visible in this options contract after our trades Were executed. NO such allegation has been made in the Notice, neither is there any mention in the Notice about any material available with SEBI to this effect. The price movement of impugned derivative contract on or the underlying cash market security also is not indicative of existence of any such practice. The scrip had closed that day at Rs 131.85 after opening at Rs 130.45. We request you to provide us with relevant material regarding this allegation which may be in your possession so that the same may be dealt with by us appropriately. In absence of it, the allegation does not hold ground. b.  Likewise, orders in ANBK3CP65 were placed by us between 13:43 and 14:03 Hrs on 18/03/2015. As above, no material has been brought forward in the Notice showing that these orders placed by us had manipulated or deceived others to enter into any contracts. Neither is it alleged in the Notice that our orders had influenced either the price or the volume in either the  Adjudication Order in the matter of Dealings in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 6 of 23     options contract or the underlying cash market security nor is there any such activity visible in the prices of derivative contract and underlying cash security, the scrip had Closed at Rs 81.45 after opening at Rs.794. We request you to provide relevant material, if available with you, to substantiate the allegation so that we may rebut it. c.  It is submitted that the allegation that we created false and misleading appearance of trading or created artificial volume in these Contracts or that the transactions are not genuine is not true. The dictionary meaning of the word 'artificial', in the present context, would mean 'not truly intended' (as per Cambridge dictionary). Non genuine means something which is not genuine, not real. It bears noting that the gain or loss arising from these contracts was settled by the clearing corporation of BSE, and Same was Collected/ paid to respective clients by BSE through respective brokers. BSE had collected transaction charges on these transactions, stamp duty was collected by State government through BSE, SEBI had collected turnover fees and the broker had collected his brokerage. This was done for both ends of the transaction. The volume was recorded by BSE and is part of historical data. Thus, the trading did not have the character of false or misleading appearance of trading and the volume was not artificial and trade genuine, as the trades were acted upon by all the entities involved. It is powers of BSE and the Clearing Corporation to cancel non genuine trades but the Same \"as not done as the trades were found genuine. It has not been alleged that Someone was misled by our trades as it Was false or misleading. We had fulfilled our obligations arising out of these transactions. The same is a matter of record and easily verifiable from the Broker. An extract of broker ledger evidencing payment is enclosed herewith (Annexure B). Thus, it cannot be alleged that we created artificial volumes or created false or misleading appearance of trading or that the trades were non genuine.  Adjudication Order in the matter of Dealings in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 7 of 23     It is thus submitted that the allegation that \"the Noticee created artificial volumes in stock options which was manipulative and deceptive in nature and created false and misleading appearance of trading, or that these were non genuine trades, is a bald statement bereft of any factual foundation or material. We reiterate that we should be afforded opportunity to rebut any such material which may be in your possession to support your allegations.  It is further submitted that the trades done by us were not reversal trades and the bids and offers made were open and available to the entire universe of participants  The Table shows that the Counter party offers and our bids were not put at the same time and there was a considerable gap of up to 8 minutes between the placement of Order and execution of trade. During this intervening period, all participant traders having access to the trading terminals could the bid/ offer on the screen and were at liberty to act on it, Essential feature of a reversal trade is 'meeting of mind', meaning both buyer and seller being on the same page to execute a trade at the Same time at the same price. Such meeting of mind is possible only if the buyer and seller are known to each other. It is known that trading on Stock Exchanges takes place anonymously and identity of buyer and seller is not known to anyone. As is discernible from the data provided with the Notice, all the orders placed were open orders, meaning for the entire trading universe to see and act upon. Thus the trades ultimately executed by us cannot be called synchronized or reversal and it does not conclude collusion and meeting of mind. We are not aware of the identity of the counter parties namely Amit Agarwal HUF and Kartick Chandra Kundu, or which city do they belong to or who their broker is. There cannot be collusion or meeting of mind unless the buyer and seller are known to each other. These names have appeared before us for the first time in the Notice. No allegation to the effect that buyer and seller knew each other has been made in the Notice. Thus, we deny that these were reversal trades.  Besides knowing the counter party, matching of price is also an essential consideration in determining whether a trade is preplanned for reversal. As can be  Adjudication Order in the matter of Dealings in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 8 of 23     seen, there is no price matching in the above cases leading conclusion that these were genuine trades.  Thus it is submitted that on the touchstone of time gap between placement of order and difference in prices, such trades cannot be termed in genuine. Preponderance of probability in this case points to a genuine trade executed in the course of normal business.  d. It is submitted, that provisions of Regulations 3 and 4 Of PFUTP Regulations 2003 not attracted in our case. The essence of these Regulations 3 and 4 is presence Of 'fraud' as defined in the exhaustive definition in Regulation 2(c) Of PFUTP Regulations 2003, and also unfair trade practices. The essential ingredient in this definition is \"to induce another person or his agent to deal in securities\". As we have already explained, there is no material or record brought out in the Notice, or in the price movement of the impugned options Contracts and the underlying securities, that our trades were intended to induce or that the trades actually induced, any one to trade taking a leaf out of our trades. In the absence of any such concrete averment in Notice, allegation of fraud cannot be leveled blankly. There must be solid material such as a person alleging that he has been induced by us by our trades or circumstances show the effect of alleged inducement. Similarly, unfair trade practice has to be specifically alleged as to how it is unfair trade practice, and not just implied. Both are absent in our ease. It is requested that should such material exist at your end, we must be afforded an opportunity to rebut the same, It is thus submitted that Regulations 3 and 4 Of PFUTP Regulations 2003 have no application in our case.   e. It is submitted that Sec 15 HA of SEBI Act 1992 applies Only if a person indulges in fraudulent and unfair trade practices relating to securities. Such \"fraudulent and unfair trade practices\" have been defined in Regulation 4(2) (a) of PFUTP Regulations 2003, An activity becomes fraudulent if it involves fraud and may include indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market. It is a trite law that a penalty provision should be construed strictly and not too Widely and should be applied only in extreme situations, as we  Adjudication Order in the matter of Dealings in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 9 of 23     have demonstrated that there is no factual allegation in the Notice about false or misleading appearance of trading, or that fraud was committed by us, Regulations g and 4 of PFUTP Regulations 2003 are not attracted. We have already explained in abovementioned paragraphs that such acts have not been committed by us. It is therefore, submitted that application of Section 15 HA is not called for. f. The inordinate delay in issuing Notice has caused prejudice to the Noticee as in the meanwhile valuable rights have accrued upon the Noticee. Thus, the Notice deserves to be withdrawn as issued beyond a reasonable period. Reply dated July 22, 2021 i. We have in our reply dated June 22, 2021 explained how the derivative contracts in which we had traded on BSE, as also the underlying securities thereon were not illiquid and why the trades carried out by us were neither in genuine nor manipulative nor deceptive, nor was there any false and misleading appearance of trading. There was no reversal of trades because of factors of difference in time and prices. Hence the trading was not in genuine. We had also shown how 'fraud', which is essential to establish fraudulent or unfair trade practice cannot be attributed to us.  ii. A look at our trading behavior in past and in future pre and post 2015 would show that the trades covered in Notice dated June 8 2021 are 'one off trades and have neither occurred before or after 2015, We are regular participants on Stock Exchanges and we submit that the trades were done by us under the trading framework of BSE within the price limits set by the Exchange and under bona fide belief that no irregularity was involved as there was no prior warning by Exchange or SEBI about the contracts that we traded in.  iii. i) We had, in para 2 (c) (page 7) of our letter dated June 22, 2021 factually stated that we are not aware of the identities of the counter party to the trades and there cannot be collusion or meeting of minds unless the buyer or seller are known to each other. There is no allegation, nor evidence, in the Notice to the effect that buyer and seller knew each other. Our views find supporting the majority Judgment of Securities Appellate Tribunal in Amaresh Pathak vs SEBI (Appeal no 322/2020 dated 16.02.2021) where the Tribunal, following Ajmera's judgment of Supreme Court observed that  10. In the absence of any finding of collusion between the buyer and the seller the charge of collusion and/or manipulation in the price of scrip cannot be sustained since it has not been proved. 13. There is no direct evidence of collusion between the appellant and the buyer. The only indirect evidence is that the appellants have sold miniscule quantities leading to an increase in the price of the scrip. One can infer manipulation but such trading cannot happen unilaterally. There must be evidence to show collusion between the buyer and the seller.  Adjudication Order in the matter of Dealings in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 10 of 23     The principle of preponderance of probability cannot be exercised in the absence of any connection between the seller and buyer. This is what the Supreme Court has held in Ajmera's case. ii) Further, Securities Appellate Tribunal observed in Almondz Entertainment Pvt Ltd v SEBI (Appeal 198 of 2020 dated 21.01.2021) that:  12. We are also of the opinion that synchronized trading can only happen between      connected persons having common intentions. Since connection between the appellants and other entities have not been established, the charge relating to synchronized trading automatically fails.\" iv. We also refer to observations of Securities Appellate Tribunal in a case of manipulation of prices in the matter of Umang Dhanuka v SEBI (Appeal 102 of 2020 dated 8 June 2021) where lack of connection between the buyer and seller was noted and considered in the following words:  We further find that there is no connection rather there is not even a thread of evidence to show any connection between the appellants and the counter party who bought the shares from the appellants.  v. Your attention is also drawn to the Supreme Court judgement, in Securities and Exchange Board of India v. Kishore R. Ajmera [(2016) 6 SCC 368]. This was a case involving brokers and sub brokers trading reversal trades in cash market. While dealing with the concept of connection between the parties concerned the Court, in para 30 of the judgement held that \"...According to us, knowledge of who the 2nd party / client or the broker is, is not relevant at all. While the screen based trading system keeps the identity of the parties anonymous it will be too na\\\\\\\\xefve to rest the conclusions on the said basis which overlooks a meeting of minds elsewhere. The Apex Court has clearly stated that not the knowledge of who the counter party is but 'meeting of mind' is very important even in screen based trading. In this case before the Supreme Court, the parties trading reversal trades were found related to each other whereas the counter parties to our trade are neither connected nor related to us. A harmonious reading of this Supreme Court judgement along with other judgements quoted by us spells out that although knowledge of identity of other party is not important but there must be connection or relation between the parties to establish the charges, and such relation or connection is absent in our case. vi. Following the above propositions, we submit that in the absence of establishing connection or collusion between the buyer and the seller charge of in genuine trade in our case cannot be sustained. In para 2 (c) (i) (page 6), we had demonstrated from records that the time difference between placement of order and execution of trades in trades carried out by us  Adjudication Order in the matter of Dealings in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 11 of 23     was up to 8 minutes, and that this significant gap of the time enabled the trading universe an opportunity to act on open orders. Apex Court in para 36 of its judgement in SEBI vs Rakhi Trading Pvt Ltd (CA 1969 of 2011 dated Feb 8 2018) had noted the importance of such orders and that absence of such orders excludes other investors from participating in these trades, In para 2 ( c ) (ii) We had also pointed out that there was price difference existing between the order placed by us and order placed by the counter parties. We draw your attention to the extract from Adjudication order MC/DS/2019-20/6209-6214 dated December 24, 2019 passed in respect of Govindji Gupta and others, where the Ld. Adjudicating Officer had considered a time difference upto 5 minutes between two trades and also difference in order prices,to be significant and recorded his findings as under:  \"42........It has been further contended that there was huge order price gap between the both legs orders. There was huge order time gap between the both legs of orders placed by the Noticees and his counterparties. In most of the instances (more than 90% of orders) there were time gap of10 second to 5 minutes. Thus the structured trades could not have been said to be intentional. In this regard, while 10 seconds is a very small time difference between orders, I find the argument on difference in order prices acceptable, as a trade cannot be intended to match in a structured manner with difference in order prices  The Securities Appellate Tribunal put a stamp of approval on the above on grounds of consistency by accepting the findings of the AO and observing as follows in Almondz Entertainment Pvt Ltd v SEBI ( appeal no 198 of 2020 dated 21.01.2021) \"same charge were exonerated. In our opinion, if the six entities were exonerated, the appellants are entitled for the same relief.   Thus, it has been recognized by SEBI, and also Securities Appellate Tribunal that a trade involving a time gap of seconds to 5(five) minutes could not have been a structured trade. Reversal trade has been recognized as a structured trade. SEBI as a Regulator and Adjudicator cannot abandon its own yardstick adopted in one case and adopt a different yardstick in our case. Also coupled with the fact that counter party was not known or related to us, preponderance of probability would suggest existence of genuine trades. Supreme Court has, in KISHORE AJMERA case in para 26 has held that ' It is the judicial duty to take note of the immediate and proximate facts and circumstances surrounding the events on which the charges/ allegations are founded and to reach what would appear to the Court to be a reasonable conclusion therefrom. The test would always  Adjudication Order in the matter of Dealings in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 12 of 23     be that what inferential process that a reasonable /prudent man would adopt to arrive at a conclusion'. What are the immediate and proximate facts to be considered and the inferential process thereon has been laid out in para31 of this Judgement and it reads as : The conclusion has to be gathered from various circumstances like that volume of trade effected, the period of persistence in trading in the particular scrip, the particulars of buy and sell orders, namely, the volume thereof, proximity of time between the two and other relevant factors. The above criteria laid down by the Supreme Court have been noted with approval and followed by the Supreme Court in another judgements in SEBI v KanaiyalalBaldevbhai Patel ( 2017 15 SCC 1) in para 62 and also in SEBI vs RakhiTrading Pvt Ltd ( CA 1969 of 2011) in pages 72 and 73, and also followed in para 27 on Page 76. iii) Weighed on these parameters, we fulfill most of the criteria, as explained in our replies, for our trades being treated genuine. We were not persistent in trading in particular scrip, our volume of trade was miniscule compared to overall volume, there was time gap between order time and trade time, there was price difference between order prices, this was the only occasion in our entire trading life that out trades have been called into question etc. vii. We may also point out that immediately on incurring losses to the tune of Rs 3,14,771, we stopped trading as no one trades continuously for making losses. We ended the year with a profit of about Rs 2, 90,000. It can be verified that such trades were not repeated by us. It is common sense that each and every transaction on the stock market cannot result in profit as one man's profit is another man's loss and thus everyone cannot be making profits. However, as stated by the Supreme Court in SEBI vs RAKI-IT TRADING (CA 1969 of 2011) consistent losses are a pointer to lack of commercial basis. We have, as a matter of record, not traded persistently for the purpose of making constant losses and stopped at once.  viii. We draw your attention to the concept of proportionality. The principle of proportionality envisages that a public authority ought to maintain a sense of proportion between his particular goals and the means he employs to achieve those goals. The principle also requires that the efforts of the means and the method adopted must not be disproportionate to the advantage sought. Various tests are applied to achieve this end, such as the Necessity test and the Cost Benefit Balancing test. The basic criteria that emerges is :- a Is the measure suitable to achieve the goal?  Adjudication Order in the matter of Dealings in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 13 of 23     b Is the measure necessary or are there less strict measures available to achieve the same goal? c The process of weighing and balancing the surrounding circumstances to answer (i) and (ii). d b) Applying the above criteria, the following facts emerge as relevant in our case:- e The amount earned / lost in the impugned trades is Rs 3,14,771, which is not a significant amount. f The alleged trades are not repetitive in nature, and have not occurred either before or after 18/07/2019. These were solitary instance. g We have never been subjected to any regulatory action before this Notice dated June 8 2021. h There is material on record, in terms of time gap of order and trade, and in terms of price difference for orders of both sides, that the trades were not structured. i No person has been induced to trade based on our trades and no price manipulation has occurred. ix. The concept of proportionality has been applied from time to time by SEBI and Appellate forums where penalty was not imposed and only warning was given. The following are a few instances of the same. a Adjudication order no 1 DS/2019-20/6209-6214 dated December 24, 2019, in respect of Govindji Gupta and others where it was not found to be a fit case for imposition of penalty. b Adjudication order EAD/2/SS-SK/2019-20/3148 dated May 1 0/02/2019 in respect of JM Financial Institutions Securities Limited, where it was held that on a preponderance of probability that Noticee had bona fide belief and that violation was caused on account of oversight and not deliberately, and thus did not call for penal consequences. c The Wholetime Member in the matter of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company , in order no WTM/AB/EFD-I/DRA4/8/2019-20 dated 31 May 2019 after into account Sec 15J, upheld the Adjudicating Officers views that imposition of penalty was not warranted in case of procedural , minor and non-serious violations of a circular. d SAT in case of DSE Financial Services Ltd vs SEBI (dated 11.09.2012) quashed AO's order imposing penalty for violations which were mostly technical or solitary instances, or for which corrective measures were taken. It was held that every discrepancy is not culpable and object could be achieved by making entity compliant. e SAT in case of Piramal Enterprises Ltd vs SEBI (Appeal no 466 dt 15 May 2019) in the matter of insider trading, held that in case of an infraction of a rule and in view of the fact that till date there were no violations of SEBI Rules,remedial and not-punitive measures, should be taken at the first inst",

SEBI had conducted inspection of Taurus Mutual Fund (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cTMF\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cTaurus MF\\\\\\\\u201d) between March 29, 2017 and January 18, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cinvestigation period\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cIP) to examine the nature of valuation, due diligence conducted by TMF in respect of its investment in debt securities issued by Ballarpur Industries Ltd (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018BILT\\\\\\\\u2019) and related entities, as well as fair treatment to investors in four of its schemes namely, Taurus Liquid Fund, Taurus Ultra Short Term Bond Fund, Taurus Short Term Income Fund and Taurus Dynamic Income Fund (\\\\\\\\u201cthe Affected Schemes\\\\\\\\u201d) which held debt securities issued by BILT before their markdown in valuation on February 22, 2017.  5. TMF informed its Board of AMC and Trustees on February 22, 2017 about the inability of BILT to honour the commitment of payment of Commercial Papers (CPs) on account of their financial crisis.  6. The Board of Taurus AMC and Trustees in its meetings held on February 22, 2017 inter alia decided to undertake the following measures with respect to default of BILT: i CPs of BILT to be reclassified as a NPA.  ii 100% provision be made by TMF of the amount in default by the BILT securities. iii Till further notice, fresh sales to be suspended in schemes of TMF holding BILT papers.  iv Management fees not to be charged on these securities till the matter is resolved.  v The receivables from BILT CPs be segregated and marked payable to the investors who were invested in the Schemes as on the date of mark down and who had incurred losses on account of the same. vi No restrictions to be imposed on redemptions and to ensure timely payment at the prevailing NAV in case of any redemption requests.Settlement Order in respect of Application Nos. 4172/2020, 4173/2020, 4174/2020, 4175/2020, 4176/2020 and 4177/2020 by Taurus Investment Trust Company Limited and 5 Ors. in the matter of Taurus Mutual Fund  Page 5 of 24 7. From the details of the exposures of TMF schemes in BILT CPs from February 19, 2017 (prior to default by BILT) to February 27, 2017 (last default) as provided by TMF it was observed that BILT had defaulted in its payments on February 20, 2017 (INR 45 crore) on February 22, 2017 (INR 39.75 crores) and on February 27, 2017 (INR 22.25 crore). TMF had considered these default amounts as receivables from the date of respective defaults.  8. Vide email dated April 12, 2017 TMF submitted that it was in compliance with the guidelines for fair valuation contained in SEBI (Mutual Funds) (Amendment) Regulations, 2012 and AMFI Best Practice Guidelines Circular No. 29/2012-13 dated May 26, 2012. TMF also provided a copy of Statement of Additional Information (SAI) dated June 30, 2016 containing its Valuation Policy. As on March 31, 2017, the valuation policy adopted by TMF for valuation of securities of the schemes of TMF (reviewed and revised with effect from March 01, 2016), was approved by the Boards of Taurus AMC and Trustees.   9. In respect of compliance with Clause (c) of the Eighth Schedule, it was observed that the Valuation Policy of TMF is broad and general in nature and does not detail or describe the process that will be adopted in case of an exceptional event. Also, the valuation policy did not elaborate any procedure or process to deal with instances of default of debt securities, which was to be treated as an exceptional event. In case of default by a debt security, neither the market quotations will be reliable nor will the quotations available reflect the realisable value of the security.  10. Though TMF in its reply dated April 12, 2017 claimed that the Valuation Policy adopted by them was in line with direction issued by AMFI, it was noted that Best Practices guidelines issued by AMFI were suggested guidelines and did not override the MF Regulations of SEBI. AMC was obligated to form specific polices/guidelines to deal with exceptional situations. Therefore, it was observed that the Valuation policy of TMF, approved by the Boards of Taurus AMC and Trustees, did not have any policies and procedures to deal with exceptional events where market quotations are no longer reliable for a particular security asSettlement Order in respect of Application Nos. 4172/2020, 4173/2020, 4174/2020, 4175/2020, 4176/2020 and 4177/2020 by Taurus Investment Trust Company Limited and 5 Ors. in the matter of Taurus Mutual Fund  Page 6 of 24 mandated in Clause (c) of Investment Valuation Norms as specified in Eighth Schedule under Regulation 25(19) and Regulation 47 of the MF Regulations. Consequently, Taurus Investment Trust Company Ltd./ Noticee No.1 (\\\\\\\\u201cTaurus Trust\\\\\\\\u201d) allegedly failed in its duty to ensure compliance of Clause (c) of Investment Valuation Norms as specified in Eighth Schedule under Regulation 25(19) and Regulation 47 of the MF Regulations read with Regulation 18(9) of SEBI MF Regulations.  11. The CEO of Taurus AMC, Mr. Waqar Naqvi (Noticee No. 2), was responsible for ensuring that the valuation policy of TMF was in line with the regulatory mandate which requires that the policy and procedures should describe the process to deal with exceptional events (such as default) where market quotations are no longer reliable for a particular security. Hence, Noticee No. 2 was alleged to have failed in his duties to ensure compliance of Clause (c) of Investment Valuation Norms as specified in Eighth Schedule under Regulation 25(19) and Regulation 47 of the MF Regulations read with Regulation 25(6A) of MF Regulations.  12. The Compliance Officer was responsible for ensuring that the valuation policy of TMF was in lines with the Regulatory mandate which requires that the policy and procedures should describe the process to deal with exceptional events (such as default) where market quotations are no longer reliable for a particular security. Hence, the Compliance officer, Ms. Anu Suri (Noticee No.3) was alleged to have failed in her duties to monitor the compliance of Clause (c) of Investment Valuation Norms as specified in Eighth Schedule under Regulation 25(19) and Regulation 47 of the MF Regulations, 1996 read with Clause (d) of Regulation 18(4) of SEBI MF Regulations.  13. In respect of compliance of TMF with Clause (d) of the Eighth Schedule of the MF Regulations regarding regular review (at least once in a Financial Year) by an independent auditor, it was observed that the valuation policy was adopted by TMF with effect from March 01, 2016. TMF vide emails dated January 12, 2017 and March 30, 2017 communicated to the auditor to review the Valuation Policy.Settlement Order in respect of Application Nos. 4172/2020, 4173/2020, 4174/2020, 4175/2020, 4176/2020 and 4177/2020 by Taurus Investment Trust Company Limited and 5 Ors. in the matter of Taurus Mutual Fund  Page 7 of 24  14. From the email communications, it was observed that the valuation policy of TMF was not reviewed in FY 2016-17, as mandated by the Regulation. TMF vide email dated January 12, 2017 communicated to the auditors to review the valuation policy. Pursuant to commencement of inspection, a reminder mail was sent on March 30, 2017 to the auditors by the CFO to review the same. TMF did not review the valuation policy as mandated in Clause (d) of Investment Valuation Norms as specified in Eighth Schedule under Regulation 25(19) and Regulation 47 of the SEBI MF Regulations.  15. Therefore, Noticee Nos. 1, 2 and 3 failed in their duties to monitor the compliance of the Regulations which mandated that Valuation policy needs to be reviewed at least once in a Financial Year, in alleged violation of Clause (d) of Investment Valuation Norms as specified in Eighth Schedule under Regulation 25(19) and Regulation 47 of the SEBI MF Regulation, 1996 read with Regulations 18 (9), 25 (6A) and 18 (4) (d), respectively, of the SEBI MF Regulations.  16. In respect of the requirement in Clause (e) of the Eighth Schedule to the MF Regulations that the valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board of Asset Management Company should seek to address conflict of interest, it was observed that the TMF had not put in place any specific policy on how to address conflict of interest in the valuation of the security but had stated that the matter would be raised to the valuation committee should such situation arise. Further, the valuation committee had not put in place any specific procedure to address conflict of interest. Therefore, TMF did not have any policy to address conflict of interest as mandated in Clause (e) of Investment Valuation Norms specified in Eighth Schedule under Regulation 25(19) and Regulation 47 of the MF Regulations.  17. In view of the above, Noticee Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were alleged to have failed in their duties to monitor the compliance with the mandate of the MF Regulations that valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board of Asset ManagementSettlement Order in respect of Application Nos. 4172/2020, 4173/2020, 4174/2020, 4175/2020, 4176/2020 and 4177/2020 by Taurus Investment Trust Company Limited and 5 Ors. in the matter of Taurus Mutual Fund  Page 8 of 24 Company should seek to address conflict of interest, in alleged violation of Clause (e) of Investment Valuation Norms specified in Eighth Schedule under Regulation 25(19) and Regulation 47 of the SEBI MF Regulation, 1996 read with Regulations 18 (9), 25 (6A) and 18 (4) (d), respectively, of the MF Regulations.  18. In respect of the requirement in Clause (g) of the Eighth Schedule to the MF Regulations it was noted that the stated provisions required the AMC to deviate from the established policies and procedures in order to value the assets in case the established policies and procedures did not result in fair/ appropriate valuation such as in case of exceptional events like the default by BILT. Taurus AMC, in its valuation policy (approved by the Board of Taurus AMC and Trustees) empowered the Valuation Committee to identify exceptional events and deviate from the existing valuation policy to value securities and adopt alternative procedures in such scenarios. However, the valuation committee of TMF which was empowered to deviate from the adopted procedures to determine fair value of a security in case the existing policies fail to value securities fairly, failed in its duties. The submissions of TMF made vide e-mail dated July 11, 2017 in this regard did not explain the publication of incorrect NAV on February 20, 2017 (all Affected Schemes) and February 21, 2017 (Taurus Liquid Fund).  19. The minutes of the Valuation Committee meeting held on February 21, 2017 revealed that Noticee No.2, i.e. Mr. Waqar Naqvi (CEO of Taurus AMC), Noticee No. 4 i.e. Mr. Amarjeet Singh (CFO, Taurus AMC), Noticee No. 5 i.e. Mr. Dheeraj Singh (Head of Investments, Taurus AMC) and Noticee No. 6 i.e. Mr. Archit Shah (Fund Manager, Taurus AMC) were members of the Valuation committee.  20. Pursuant to the default by BILT, the following events took place:- a February 20, 2017: TMF submitted vide email dated March 02, 2017 that it became aware of the default around 7:25 PM on February 20, 2017 but went ahead and published the NAV of the schemes without appropriately valuing BILT debt securities. The NAV of the affected schemes were published at 08:44 pm on February 20, 2017.Settlement Order in respect of Application Nos. 4172/2020, 4173/2020, 4174/2020, 4175/2020, 4176/2020 and 4177/2020 by Taurus Investment Trust Company Limited and 5 Ors. in the matter of Taurus Mutual Fund  Page 9 of 24 b February 21, 2017: As per the submissions of TMF, on the next day, February 21, 2017, the Valuation committee members met to discuss the issue in detail and recommended that the investment in BILT needs to be marked down fully and this recommendation be made to the Board of AMC and Trustees Company for them to take a final decision. However, NAV was published for Taurus Liquid Fund without appropriately valuing BILT debt securities. The NAV of Taurus Liquid Scheme was published at 08:08 pm on February 21, 2017 c February 22, 2017: The Board of the AMC and the Board of the Trustee Company met on February 22, 2017 (afternoon) and decided to endorse the Valuation Committee recommendation to mark down all the investments / maturity proceeds of BILT CPs by 100%. This had an impact on NAV of the affected schemes. The NAV of the affected schemes were published at 08:49 pm on February 22, 2017.  21. TMF informed that they became aware of the default in the late evening (by 7:25 PM on February 20, 2017) and there was nothing in public domain to establish that there is a fall out in repayment capacity of BILT as the securities in question were still an investment grade. An analysis of the investment pattern in BILT and BGPPL revealed that TMF had been reducing their exposure in BILT by rolling over their investment in CPs. TMF was able to reduce their exposure to INR 107 crore from peak investment of about INR 360 crore in Aug 2015, by rolling over. This shows that TMF was aware about the financial distress that BILT and BGPPL were facing. TMF was also aware about the downgrade of credit rating of BILT and BGPPL which happened in July 2016 and December 2016. Further, TMF was also aware about the fact that the yield of the CPs of BILT had increased from 10.40% in year 2012 to 14.25% in February 2017, indicating a very high risk.  22. Further, BGPPL, a subsidiary of BILT, had defaulted repayment of their CPs on January 13, 2017, to another mutual fund i.e. IDBI MF for an amount of INR 26.75 crore. Incidentally, TMF was also a subscriber to the CPs of BGPPL during the same period i.e. January 2017 and also prior to that period as well.Settlement Order in respect of Application Nos. 4172/2020, 4173/2020, 4174/2020, 4175/2020, 4176/2020 and 4177/2020 by Taurus Investment Trust Company Limited and 5 Ors. in the matter of Taurus Mutual Fund  Page 10 of 24  23. The investment of TMF in BGPPL for the month of January 2017 was as follows:-         24. The abovementioned investments of TMF in BGPPL were honoured by BGPPL on maturity dates i.e. January 19, January 23 and January 24, 2017. BGPPL defaulted to IDBI MF for INR 26.75 crore on January 13, 2017 but honoured the payment to TMF on January 19, January 23 and January 24, 2017 amounting to INR 82.5 crore.  25. It was seen that the payments made to and received from BILT and BGPPL were synchronized in such a way that TMF was making the payment for subscribing to CPs of BILT just few hours before the maturity of the previous CPs subscribed by the TMF in BILT or BGPPL indicating arrangement between BILT, BGPPL and TMF. Thus, it was alleged that TMF was well aware of the default done by BGPPL which was also acknowledged by TMF officials in the meetings held with them during the course of inspection.  26. TMF vide letter dated April 06, 2017 had forwarded the extracts of the correspondences exchanged with BILT/BGPPL. A perusal of the communications revealed that rollover was happening in coordination between TMF and BILT. BILT had been requesting TMF to rollover the securities in order to deal with the distress the company was going through. Further, TMF had been rolling over the CPs of BILT and BGPPL for more than one year. The process of rollover usually starts one or two days before the maturity of existing CPs. As TMF had been rolling over CPs of BILT/BGPPL over one year, it was natural for TMF to carry on the rollover Name of Scheme  Amount receivable on maturity (INR crore)  Date of Maturity  Taurus Liquid Fund  67.00  Jan 19, 2017  Taurus Dynamic Income Fund  1.50  Jan 19, 2017  Taurus Short Term Income Fund  3.00  5.00  2.50  Jan 19, 2017  Jan 23, 2017  Jan 24, 2017  Taurus Short Term Bond Fund  3.50  Jan 19, 2017  Total  82.50Settlement Order in respect of Application Nos. 4172/2020, 4173/2020, 4174/2020, 4175/2020, 4176/2020 and 4177/2020 by Taurus Investment Trust Company Limited and 5 Ors. in the matter of Taurus Mutual Fund  Page 11 of 24 process for CPs which were maturing on February 20, 2017, of amount INR 45 crore. This indicates that TMF may be aware the default was imminent on February 20, 2017.   27. Additionally, inspection of Date and Time Stamping Machine (\\\\\\\\u201cDTSM\\\\\\\\u201d) and Adherence to cut-off timings revealed the time stamp on some of the applications were as follows:    Date  Name of applicant  Time stamp  Nature of application  20/02/2017  Dwarkanath S Rajan  TAMC AML 20FEB\\\\\\\\u201917 15:48 08470  Change of nominee  20/02/2017  Sukanta Dey  TAMC AML 20FEB\\\\\\\\u201917 14:54 08471  Redemption of all units worth INR 9197.27 from Taurus Short Term Income Fund  20/02/2017  Punjab and Sind Bank  TAMC AML 20FEB\\\\\\\\u201917 14:57 08472  Redemption of all units worth INR 50.05 crore from Taurus Liquid Fund  22/02/2017  Kohinoor Planet Constructions Pvt. Ltd.  TAMC AML 22FEB\\\\\\\\u201917 13:26 08473  Purchase worth INR 25,00,000 in Taurus Liquid Scheme   28. From the above the following was observed:-  From the time stamp it is seen that the serial number 08470 was generated on February 20, 2017, at 3:48 pm. Therefore, the next serial number should be stamped after this time.  However, the next two serial numbers i.e. 08471 and 08472 were generated on February 20, 2017, at 2:54 pm and 2:57 pm respectively.  This proves that Taurus AMC has tampered the time stamp machine on February 20, 2017, to give favour to two applicants i.e. Sukanta Dey and Punjab and Sind Bank.  29. The time stamp on some of the applications of previous working day i.e. February 17, 2017, were as follows:-  Date  Name of applicant  Time stamp  Nature of applicationSettlement Order in respect of Application Nos. 4172/2020, 4173/2020, 4174/2020, 4175/2020, 4176/2020 and 4177/2020 by Taurus Investment Trust Company Limited and 5 Ors. in the matter of Taurus Mutual Fund  Page 12 of 24 17/02/2017  Samooda Khatoon  TAMCAML 17FEB\\\\\\\\u20191717:39 08450  Surrender of unit certificate  17/02/2017  Madhavi Mukund Sagade  TAMC AML 17FEB\\\\\\\\u201917 14:51 08451  Redemption of all units worth INR 1.02 crore from Taurus Dynamic Income Fund  17/02/2017  Priya Jude Abraham  TAMC AML 17FEB\\\\\\\\u201917 14:51 08452  Redemption of all units worth INR 2,05,343 from Ultra Short Term bond Fund  17/02/2017  Jude J Abraham  TAMC AML 17FEB\\\\\\\\u201917 14:52 08453  Redemption of all units worth INR 10,96,497 from Ultra Short Term bond Fund  17/02/2017  Joseph Abraham  TAMC AML 17FEB\\\\\\\\u201917 14:52 08454  Redemption of all units worth INR 4,76,522 from Ultra Short Term bond Fund  20/02/2017  Ace Co.op Bank Ltd.

From the above the following was observed :- a From the time stamp it was seen that the serial number 08450 was generated on February 17, 2017, at 5:39 pm. Therefore, the next serial number should be stamped after this time. b However, the next four serial numbers i.e. 08451, 08452, 08453 and 08454 were generated on February 17, 2017, at 2:51pm, 2:51pm, 2:52 pm and 2:52 pm respectively. c This further proved that Taurus AMC had also tampered the time stamp machine on February 17, 2017, to give favour to four applicants i.e. Madhvi Mukund Sagade, Priya Jude Abraham, Jude J Abraham and Joseph Abraham. d It was also observed that Mr. Jude J Abraham, Ms. Priya Jude Abraham and Mr. Joseph Abraham are related parties as Ms. Priya Jude Abraham is the wife of Mr. Jude J Abraham and Mr. Joseph Abraham is father of Mr. Jude J Abraham. e Taurus vide email dated November 21 & 22, 2017 confirmed that Mr. Jude J Abraham was an employee of Taurus Mutual Fund/ Taurus AMC asSettlement Order in respect of Application Nos. 4172/2020, 4173/2020, 4174/2020, 4175/2020, 4176/2020 and 4177/2020 by Taurus Investment Trust Company Limited and 5 Ors. in the matter of Taurus Mutual Fund  Page 13 of 24 Head - Sales, Marketing & Product Development from February 9, 2015 to May 3, 2017  31. The above instance of tampering with time DTSM to give benefit to select few investors which included the investment of an employee i.e. Head - Sales, Marketing & Product Development of Taurus AMC, indicates that Taurus AMC was aware of the possibility of default by BILT well before 7:30 pm on February 20, 2017.  32. Further, as per the valuation policy adopted by TMF, the valuation committee was empowered to deviate from the approved and disclosed valuation policy, in case the established policies and procedures of valuation do not result in fair/ appropriate valuation. Such deviation would be required to be reported to the Board of Trustee and Board of AMC with appropriate disclosure to investors.  33. As per the version of TMF, they became aware of default by BILT around 7:30 pm on February 20, 2017, and they disclosed the NAV of the affected scheme on February 20, 2017 at 08:44 pm. Thus TMF/ Valuation Committee had around one and half hour to fairly value the CP of BILT. However, Valuation Committee/TMF choose to go ahead with the publication of NAV without appropriately valuing the CP of BILT on February 20, 2017. However, in terms of valuation policy adopted by TMF, the valuation committee should have valued the CP of BILT on February 20, 2017, itself before disclosing the NAV on February 20, 2017.  34. Further, in terms of SEBI Circular SEBI/IMD/CIR No. 5/63714 dated March 29, 2006, mutual funds are allowed time upto 9.00 pm for uploading the NAVs of their schemes on AMFI\\\\\\\\u2019s website and also on their own website. If the NAVs of a mutual fund is not available before commencement of business hours on the following day due to any reason, the mutual funds would have to issue a press release giving reasons for the delay and explain when they would be able to publish the NAVs. As per this Circular, if TMF could not value the CP of BILT appropriately on February 20, 2017, then TMF should not have disclosed the NAV of affectedSettlement Order in respect of Application Nos. 4172/2020, 4173/2020, 4174/2020, 4175/2020, 4176/2020 and 4177/2020 by Taurus Investment Trust Company Limited and 5 Ors. in the matter of Taurus Mutual Fund  Page 14 of 24 schemes and should have issued a press release giving reasons for delay and explained when TMF would be able to publish NAV. However, TMF did not act as per this circular and published the NAV of affected schemes on February 20, 2017 and February 21, 2017 (for Taurus Liquid Scheme). Therefore, TMF was alleged to have violated the requirement of SEBI circular SEBI/IMD/CIR No. 5/63714 dated March 29, 2006.  35. Valuation committee of TMF met on February 21, 2017 and recommended that the investment in BILT needs to be marked down fully and this decision should be made to the Board of AMC and Trustees Company for them to take a final decision. This led to the situation where assets were not valued fairly on the day of default and resulted in giving beneficial treatment to those who redeemed on February 20, 2017 and unfair treatment to the investors who remained in the scheme and to those investors who have subscribed to the scheme on February 22, 2017, especially in the Taurus Liquid Scheme because units were allotted with the previous day\\\\\\\\u2019s NAV and mark down happened on the February 22, 2017. This action of the Valuation committee benefitted those investors who had redeemed on February 20, 2017 as they were not affected by the mark down even though they were invested in the scheme on the day of the default and the applicable NAV didn\\\\\\\\u2019t account for the mark down.  36. Taurus AMC, in its valuation policy (approved by the Board of Taurus AMC and Trustees) empowered the Valuation Committee to deviate from the existing valuation policy to value securities in case of a situation where the securities do not reflect the realisable value. However, the valuation committee of TMF failed to discharge its duty to deviate from the adopted procedures to determine fair value of a security in case the existing policies fail to value securities fairly.  37. In view of the above, it was alleged that Noticee Nos. 1, 2 and 3 failed to comply with the regulatory mandate in Clause (g) of the Eighth Schedule to the MF Regulations under Regulation 25(19) and Regulation 47 read with Regulations 18Settlement Order in respect of Application Nos. 4172/2020, 4173/2020, 4174/2020, 4175/2020, 4176/2020 and 4177/2020 by Taurus Investment Trust Company Limited and 5 Ors. in the matter of Taurus Mutual Fund  Page 15 of 24 (9), 25(6A) and 18 (4) (d) of the MF Regulations and SEBI Circular SEBI/IMD/CIR No. 5/63714 dated March 29, 2006.  38. The Noticees No.1, 2 and 3 failed in their duties to monitor compliance with the MF Regulations and SEBI Circular dated March 29, 2006 and thereby preventing disclosure of incorrect NAV on February 20 and 21, 2017.  39. Further, the action of the Valuation committee of TMF resulted in declaration of incorrect NAV on February 20, 2017 and February 21, 2017 (for Taurus Liquid Fund) which adversely affected the interest of the investors. The valuation committee of TMF comprising Noticee Nos. 2, 4, 5 and 6 should have ensured that the securities were fairly valued prior to the declaration of NAV, and by failing to do so, allegedly violated Clause (g) of Eighth Schedule under Regulation 25(19) and 47 of the MF Regulations.  40. In respect of the requirement in Clause (h) of the Eighth Schedule to the MF Regulations which require the asset management company to have policies and procedures to detect and prevent incorrect valuation, though TMF had policies and procedure detailed in their valuation policy to detect and prevent incorrect valuation, in the case of default by BILT, TMF adopted a process which led to incorrect NAV being published on February 20, 2017 (all affected schemes) and February 21, 2017 (for Taurus Liquid Fund).  41. Therefore, Noticee Nos. 1, 2 and 3, in their respective capacities, failed to detect and prevent incorrect valuation, in alleged violation of Clause (h) of Investment Valuation Norms as specified in Eighth Schedule under Regulation 25(19) and Regulation 47 of the MF Regulation.  42. TMF AMC had an Investment Committee in place and the fund management team carries out the research. TMF had submitted that the research report format was approved by the Board of AMC and Trustees. The research report format for manufacturing companies contains 13 parameters of Balance Sheet and 7Settlement Order in respect of Application Nos. 4172/2020, 4173/2020, 4174/2020, 4175/2020, 4176/2020 and 4177/2020 by Taurus Investment Trust Company Limited and 5 Ors. in the matter of Taurus Mutual Fund  Page 16 of 24 parameters on Financial Ratios.

Noticee no.1 acquired additional 5.46% shares of the company which led to increase in his  shareholding from 26.32% to 31.78%. Since, Noticee no. 1 received 4,39,309 (5.14%)  shares from the other promoter, i.e Noticee 3 by way of off-market transactions on June 7, 2016, the subject acquisition of shares required the acquirers/Noticees to seek exemption from making a public announcement of open offer in terms of Regulation 3(2) of SAST Regulations r/w Regulation 10 (1)(a)(ii) of SAST Regulations. iv) Further, Noticee no. 2 received 7,58,446 (8.87%) equity shares from the other promoter, i.e. Noticee no. 7 on April 27, 2016 which led to her shareholding breaching 5% in the Target Company and increasing from 2.17% and reaching to 11.03%.

The Noticees, vide separate letters dated May 4, 2021 submitted, inter alia, the following: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 \\\\\\\\u201cIn the same matter, Ritesh International Limited, Mr. Rajiv Arora, Ms. Anita Arora, Mr. Ritesh Arora and Rajiv Arora HUF had received show cause notice no.

In the matter of Ritesh International Limited                                                                                                     Page 6 of 16  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In this Order penalty of Rs. One Lakh was imposed on Company, which was paid vie on 17.11.2018 vide UTR No. ALLAH18321358338 and was intimated to SEBI vide letter dated 21.11.2018. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The requisite disclosures under Regulation 29(2), 10(5), 10(6) and 10(7) were also submitted vide letter dated 01.05.2019 on 08.05.2019 to SEBI.\\\\\\\\u201d  7. In the context of the present proceeding and as observed in the previous paragraph, the Noticees have in their submissions contended that in the same matter, they were subjected to another adjudication proceeding and in this regard, an Order dated 31.10.2018 was also passed by the Adjudicating Officer wherein monetary penalty was imposed on the Noticees. In response to above, the Noticees were informed by SEBI vide email dated May 7, 2021 that \\\\\\\\u201cIt is observed that the said adjudication order was passed for the alleged violation of regulation 7(2) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015. However, in the instant matter, the Show Cause Notice dated April 19, 2021 is issued to you for the alleged violation of regulations 10(5), 10(6), 29(2) read with 29(3) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011. Therefore, the current adjudication proceedings are totally different from the earlier proceedings against which an order has been passed by the AO, SEBI.\\\\\\\\u201d 8. Subsequently, the Noticees, vide letter dated May 18, 2021 submitted their reply to the SCN, stating inter alia, the following: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 That the provisions of disclosures in Regulations 10(5), 10(6) and 29(2) of Takeover Regulation and provisions of disclosures in Regulation 7(2) of PIT regulations are not substantially different, since violation of first automatically triggers violation of second. The said takeover regulations and PIT Regulations are not stand alone regulations and one is corollary of other. Both regulations are of SEBI and violations in both are adjudicated commonly by the SEBI. Thus, when there is same lawmaker, same adjudication agency, same violation of the same Company, then there should not be any second adjudication under Takeover regulation, once it is already completed under PIT Regulation, or alternatively the common adjudication should be carried out for both Regulations. In the matter of Ritesh International Limited                                                                                                     Page 7 of 16  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 That the transfer was between promoters by way of gift, in off market transactions, under a family settlement, which cannot impact the market sentiments. No unfair gain or advantage has occurred to us and also no harm or loss has been caused to other investors. The basic purpose of the said disclosures is that there should not be any loss to general investors due its price sensitive nature and if we look at the trend of rate of shares of the Company, there was no fluctuation in market during or near o the period of these transactions. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 That the delay in submitting disclosure was technical in nature, and due to inadvertence, which was devoid of any malafide intention. Further, no harm is caused to any investor due to our non-disclosure as the details regarding the change in our shareholding was disclosed in the shareholding pattern filed by the Company. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 That while determining the quantum of penalty under section 15A(b), it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act. While considering section 15J, no penalty should be imposed because there was no disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made as a result of the default; no loss was caused to any investor and there was no such other case of default in the past. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 That disclosure under regulation 10(5) and 10(6) are required for claiming exemption for inter se transfer among promoters, as per regulation 3(2) of Takeover regulations, if acquirer, together with persons acting in concert (PAC) with him, has acquired shares entitling them to exercise additionally more than five per cent of the voting rights. However, the instant case, before the transactions under question, the acquirer/PAC were holding 49.45% of equity shares of Company and after the said transactions, the acquirer/PAC were holding 49.52% of equity shares of the Company. In other words, the transactions under question have not entitled them to exercise additionally more than five per cent of the voting rights. Regulation 3(2) nowhere asks for acquisition by an individual, but asks for acquisition by \\\\\\\\u2018Persons acting in concert\\\\\\\\u2019.  9. In terms of the Adjudication Rules, Noticees were provided with an opportunity of personal hearing in the matter on June 24, 2021 through the WEBEX platform by the undersigned. The Noticees appeared for the hearing on the stipulated date i.e on June 24, 2021 and reiterated the submissions made by them vide letter dated May 18, 2021. In the matter of Ritesh International Limited                                                                                                     Page 8 of 16  The Noticees further made additional submissions in the matter vide email dated July 09, 2021. Since the Noticees during the course of the hearing mentioned that they had made the relevant disclosures to the stock exchange, the Noticees were advised to submit the relevant proof of the disclosures made by them to the stock exchange.  10. The Noticees, vide email dated July 9, 2021 forwarded a letter dated July 8, 2021 stating, inter alia, the following: \\\\\\\\u201cRegulation 10 provides for the exemption for inter se transfers among promoters, from the \\\\\\\\u201cobligation to make an open offer under regulation 3\\\\\\\\u201d, subject to making some disclosures. Thus, disclosures for seeking exemption are required only if there is an \\\\\\\\u201cobligation to make an open offer under regulation 3\\\\\\\\u201d. However, there is no such obligation as acquirer, together with persons acting in concert (PAC) with him, has not acquired shares entitling them to exercise additionally more than five per cent of the voting rights as required in Regulation 3(2). In the instant case, Before the transactions under question, the Acquirer/PAC were holding 49.45% of equity shares of Company and after the said transactions, the Acquirer/PAC were holding 49.52% of equity shares of Company. In other words, the transactions under question have not entitled them to exercise additionally more than five per cent of the voting rights. Regulation 3(2) nowhere asks for acquisition by an individual, but asks for acquisition by \\\\\\\\u2018Persons acting in concert\\\\\\\\u2019.\\\\\\\\u201d  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND EVIDENCE  11. I have carefully perused the allegations levelled against the Noticees in the SCN, their reply and the material/documents made available on record. It is alleged in the SCN that there were inter-se transfer of shares of the company among the Noticees during the relevant period and therefore, the Noticees were required to intimate to the stock exchange before and after the date of acquisition of the shares by them and also submit the necessary report to the stock exchange as required under Regulations 10(5) and 10(6) of the SAST Regulations. It is alleged that Noticees have failed to comply with the above requirements. In the matter of Ritesh International Limited                                                                                                     Page 9 of 16  12. Before moving forward, the relevant provisions of the SAST Regulations allegedly violated by the Noticees are mentioned as under: 10(5) In respect of acquisitions under clause (a) of sub-regulation (1), and clauses (e) and (f) of sub-regulation (4), the acquirer shall intimate the stock exchanges where the shares of the target company are listed, the details of the proposed acquisition in such form as may be specified, at least four working days prior to the proposed acquisition, and the stock exchange shall forthwith disseminate such information to the public. 10(6) In respect of any acquisition made pursuant to exemption provided for in this regulation, the acquirer shall file a report with the stock exchanges where the shares of the target company are listed, in such form as may be specified not later than four working days   from   the   acquisition, and   the   stock   exchange   shall   forthwith disseminate such information to the public. 13. It is observed that Noticees who are the promoters of the company are also the \\\\\\\\u2018persons acting in concert\\\\\\\\u2019 as defined under regulation 2(1)(q)(2)(iv) of the SAST Regulations. The total share capital of the company during the relevant period was Rs 8.55 crore (represented by 85,52,822 shares).  It is observed that, for the quarter ended  March 2016, the promoter group of the  company comprised of the following promoters (Source: BSE Website)- Name Total No. of Shares Held Shareholding (%) Rajiv Arora 22,51,510 26.32 Rajiv Arora HUF 7,58,446 8.87 Ritesh Arora 4,39,309 5.14 Rijul Arora 3,11,007 3.64 Roopica Arora 2,25,800 2.64 Anita Arora 1,85,415 2.17 Bharti Bhushan Jindal 30,234 0.35 In the matter of Ritesh International Limited                                                                                                     Page 10 of 16  Sakshi Arora 27,617 0.32 Total 42,29,338 49.45  14. It is further observed that for the quarter ended June 2016, the promoter group of the  company comprised of the following promoters (Source: BSE Website)-  Name of person/entity Total No. of Shares Held Shareholding (%) Rajiv Arora 27,18,436 31.78 Rijul Arora 3,11,007 3.64 Roopica Arora 2,25,800 2.64 Anita Arora 9,49,861 11.11 Bharti Bhushan Jindal 30,234 0.35 Total 42,35,338  49.52   15. As per the examination report, it is mentioned that during the relevant period, the following  inter-se off market transactions took place among the promoters/promoter group of the Company: Person/Entity Name Date of Transactions Pre-shareholding No of shares transferred Post- Shareholding Rajiv Arora HUF  (PAN: AAJHR9106D) 27/04/2016 7,58,446 (8.87%) (7,58,446) (8.87%) NIL Anita Arora (PAN: ABIPA4959P) 27/04/2016 1,85,415 (2.17%) 7,58,446 (8.87%) 9,43,861 (11.03%) Rajiv Arora (PAN: AAYPA9777A) 07/06/2016 22,79,127 (26.64%) 4,39,309 (5.14%) 27,18,436 (31.78%) In the matter of Ritesh International Limited                                                                                                     Page 11 of 16  Ritesh Arora  (PAN: AGXPA2175P) 07/06/2016 4,39,309 (5.14%) (4,39,309) (5.14%) NIL  16. As can be observed from the above Table, both Noticee No. 1 and Noticee no. 2 had acquired additional 4,39,309 shares and 7,58,446 shares, respectively by way of inter-se off market transaction from the other promoters.  As already mentioned, the Noticees were coming under the promoter/promoter group of the company and were also \\\\\\\\u2018persons acting in concert\\\\\\\\u2019 within the meaning of the SAST Regulations. I note that the Noticees collectively held 49.45% of the total shareholding in the company prior to the aforementioned transactions of Noticee nos 1 and 2. I find that the off-market transactions of Noticee nos 1 and 2 during the relevant period increased their collective stake in the company by 14.01% and as such, they had together acquired more than  5% stake in the company during the said financial year i.e 2016-17. Noticee no. 1 received 4,39,309 (5.14%) shares from the other promoter i.e Noticee no.  3 on June 7, 2016 and Noticee no. 2  received 7,58,446 (8.87%)  shares from Noticee no 7 on April 27, 2016. The aforementioned acquisition of shares by Noticee nos 1 & 2 required the Noticees to seek exemption from making the public announcement of open offer required in terms of Regulation 3 (2) of PIT Regulations r/w Regulation 10(1)(a)(ii) of the SAST Regulations. The said exemption was available to the Noticees subject to them making the necessary disclosures and also filing the necessary report mandated under regulations 10(5) and 10(6) of SAST Regulations. 17. In terms of regulation 10(5) of the SAST Regulations, in respect of the acquisitions under clause (a) of sub-regulation (1) of Regulation 10, and clauses (e) and (f) of sub-regulation (4) of Regulation 10, the acquirer shall intimate the stock exchanges where the shares of the target company are listed, the details of the proposed acquisition in such form as may be specified, at least four working days prior to the proposed acquisition of shares and the stock exchange shall forthwith disseminate such information to the public. Further, in terms of Regulation 10(6) of the SAST Regulations, in respect of any acquisition made pursuant to the exemption provided for in this regulation, the acquirer shall file a report with the stock exchanges where In the matter of Ritesh International Limited                                                                                                     Page 12 of 16  the shares of the target company are listed, in such form as may be specified not later than four working days from the date of acquisition of shares, and the stock exchange shall forthwith disseminate such information to the public. 18. As already mentioned above, the aforementioned acquisition of shares by way of inter-se transfer of shares among the promoters during the relevant period required the Noticees to intimate to the stock exchange where the shares of the company are listed, i.e. BSE of the proposed acquisition of shares at least 4 working days prior to the acquisition of shares in terms of the provisions of Regulation 10(5) of SAST Regulations. Moreover, as per regulation 10(6) of SAST Regulations, the Noticees were also required to file a report to the stock exchanges about the said acquisition not later than 4 working  days from the date of acquisition of shares and the stock exchange in turn were required to disseminate such information to the public through its website.  19. However, in the present matter, it is on record that Noticees have neither intimated BSE prior to the acquisition of the shares nor did they file any report with the BSE pursuant to the acquisition of the shares. On perusal of the website of BSE, it is noted that no such intimations/ filings were made by the Noticees. Further, BSE vide its email dated July 16, 2021 has confirmed that Noticees have neither made any disclosures before the acquisition of the shares nor did they file any report pursuant to the acquisition of the shares.  In view of the same, I hold that Noticees have not complied with the requirements of Regulations 10(5) and 10 (6) of the SAST Regulations and therefore, it is established that Noticees have violated the provisions of Regulation 10(5) and Regulation 10(6) of the SAST Regulations.  20. The Noticees have contended that there was no obligation on them to make the public announcement of open offer and comply with the requirements of Regulations 10 (5) and 10(6) of the SAST Regulations as they along with the \\\\\\\\u2018persons acting in concert\\\\\\\\u2019 had not acquired the shares entitling them to exercise additional 5% of the voting rights of the company under regulations 3(2) of the SAST Regulations. The contention of the Noticee in this regard is totally misplaced. It is observed that the acquisition of shares by Noticee No. 1 and Noticee No. 2 during the relevant period by way of inter- In the matter of Ritesh International Limited                                                                                                     Page 13 of 16  se transfer/acquisition from the other members of the promoter group had breached the threshold limit of 5% during the FY 2016-17 as stipulated under Regulation 3 (2) of the SAST Regulations. As already mentioned above, Regulation 10 provides for exemption to the acquirers from making the public announcement of open offer subject to them fulfilling certain conditions, viz., intimating the concerned stock exchange at least four working days prior to the proposed acquisition of shares and also filing the necessary report to the stock exchange pursuant to the acquisition of shares within four working days from the date of such transactions. It is on record that Noticees have not complied with the above requirements laid down under the SAST Regulations.  21. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the lack of information in the public domain with regard to the acquisition of shares by the promoters i.e the Noticees and the consequent change in their shareholding would create information asymmetry, at the relevant time and further, failure on the part of the Noticees to submit the report to the stock exchange pursuant to the acquisition of shares  would also defeat  the very purpose of the provisions of Regulation 10(5) and Regulation 10(6) of the SAST Regulations.  In this context, in the matter of Virendrakumar Jayantilal Patel Vs SEBI, vide Order dated October 14, 2014, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT has held that  \\\\\\\\u201c..... obligation to make the disclosures within the stipulated time is a mandatory obligation and penalty is imposed for not complying with the mandatory obligation.\\\\\\\\u201d 22. Further, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the case of MiIlan Mahendra Securities Pvt. Ltd. vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 66/2003 and decided on November 15, 2006 by SAT) has held that \\\\\\\\u201cthe purpose of the SAST Regulation is to bring about transparency in the transactions and assist the regulator to effectively monitor the transactions in the market, and therefore, it cannot be subscribed to the view that the violations are technical in nature\\\\\\\\u201d. 23. In the present case, it would also be appropriate to rely upon the observations of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in its order dated September 14, 2010, in the matter of Ushdev Trade Limited v. SEBI, Appeal no. 106 of 2010, wherein it was held by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026we are satisfied that even though the appellant violated the provisions of Regulation 10 of the takeover code, this violation, in the circumstances of the case, has not prejudiced or jeopardized the interest of the shareholders of the target company and cannot be said to be In the matter of Ritesh International Limited                                                                                                     Page 14 of 16  serious enough calling for an exorbitant penalty as imposed by the adjudicating officer. This is not a case where a non-promoter has acquired a substantial chunk of shares in the target company changing its shareholding pattern and has gone away without making a public announcement. The acquisition by the appellant is within the promoter group which has not led to any change in the control of the target company nor has its management changed. However, Regulation 10 having been violated, penalty must follow as observed by the Supreme Court in Chairman, SEBI vs. Shriram Mutual fund AIR 2006 SC 2287\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d.  24. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI Vs. Shri Ram Mutual Fund [2006] 68 SCL 216(SC) held that \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201cIn our considered opinion, penalty is attracted as soon as the contravention of the statutory obligation as contemplated by the Act and the Regulations is established and, therefore, the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes wholly irrelevant\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d.  25. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case, I am convinced that such defaults attract the liability to pay penalty as prescribed under the provisions of section 15 A (b) of the SEBI Act, which provides as follows :  SEBI Act  15A. Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder,\\\\\\\\u2014 (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees;   26. While determining the quantum of penalty under section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, it is important to consider the relevant factors as stipulated in section 15J of the SEBI Act, which reads as under:- In the matter of Ritesh International Limited                                                                                                     Page 15 of 16  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer.  15J. While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:-  (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default;  (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default;  (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  27. From the material available on record, it may not be possible to ascertain the exact monetary loss caused to investors or unfair advantage made by the Noticees on account of default by the Noticees. The main objectives of the SAST Regulations are to afford fair treatment to shareholders who are affected by failure on the part of the promoters\\\\\\\\u2019 i.e Noticees to make the necessary disclosures about change in their shareholding.  The Regulation  seeks  to achieve  fair treatment by inter alia mandating  timely and adequate disclosure of information to the public/ investors / shareholders to enable them to make an informed decision to be part of / or not to be part of companies due to such change in shareholding/ information made available etc. True and timely disclosures are also an essential part of the proper functioning of the securities market and failure to do so results in preventing the investors from taking well-informed decisions.  ORDER  28. Having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, the material available on record, the submissions of the Noticees, the factors mentioned in the provisions of Section 15-J of the SEBI Act and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby impose a penalty of Rs. 3,00,000/- (Rupees  Three Lakh only) , on the Noticees under the provisions of section 15A(b) of the SEBI ",

These OCDs and CCDs were further pledged by WGC to Mutual Funds for the purpose of raising funds.  d) In view of the nature of transactions and structuring thereof, SEBI conducted an investigation to ascertain whether there was any violation of provisions of SEBI Act and/ or SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) with respect to the transactions of the shares held by DHFL in DPLI with its wholly owned subsidiary, DIL and other related transactions.  e) The investigation period was taken as February 01, 2017 (Incorporation date of DIL) to March 31, 2017 (Completion date of the transaction i.e. the sale of stake in DPLI by DHFL to DIL) (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIP\\\\\\\\u201d).  f) The chronology of events with regard to the transaction is given below:  Date Event December 18, 2013 With the approval of the board and the IRDA and NHB, DHFL enters into a JV with Prudential International Insurance Holdings Limited and acquires a 50% equity stake in DPLI from DLF Ltd.    DHFL's investment in DPLI as on Feb 2017 was Rs. 31.07 crores February 2, 2017 DHFL incorporated a 100% subsidiary, DIL, investing Rs. 100.5 crore through equity capital. DIL was constituted with the intent of becoming a Core Investment Company. February 14, 2017 DHFL's Audit Committee and board, subject to the approval of shareholders of the Company, approved to sell its stake in DPLI (representing 50% of the paid up equity share capital of DPLI) to DIL at a fair market value of Rs. 2000.50 crore as determined by anAdjudication order in the matter of Transaction of the shares held by DHFL in DHFL Pramerica Life Insurance Company Ltd. and related matters thereof                                      Page 4 of 22 internationally reputed actuarial consultant. This was to unlock the value of DHFL's investment in DPLI.  February 21, 2017 The draft Share Purchase Agreement (\\\\\\\\u201cSPA\\\\\\\\u201d) was executed between DHFL and DIL. March 17, 2017 Shareholders approved the transaction on a majority of minority basis as it was constituted to be a RPT- Related Party Transaction. March 30, 2017 The Finance Committee of DHFL's board approved the execution of the aforesaid Option Agreement between DHFL and WGC, in order to ensure that the underlying shares of DPLI remain within the DHFL group.   In order to fund the acquisition, over and above the equity contribution received from DHFL, DIL raised Rs. 1,901 crores by CCDs, convertible into equal number of equity shares of DIL after the expiry of 100 months from the date on which the CCDs were issued and mandatorily to be converted after the expiry of 110 months.    WGC funded the acquisition of the CCDs through internal accruals and through a NCD issue of Rs.1900 crore to certain MFs. March 31, 2017 On completion of the transaction, DHFL received Rs. 2000.5 crore from DIL on 31st March, 2017.  It sold 18,70,30,934 equity shares of DPLI [equivalent to 50% of the paid-up share capital of DPLI] to DIL. The aforesaid total consideration received by DHFL was utilised for the purpose of its lending activities.    Disclosures made by DHFL to Stock Exchanges as per Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015  g) In order to unlock the value of Company\\\\\\\\u2019s (DHFL\\\\\\\\u2019s) investment in DPLI, the Board of Directors and Members of the Company (DHFL) approved the sale of equity shares of DPLI to DIL at the fair market value of Rs. 2,000.50 crores, determined by an actuarial consultant namely Willis Towers Watson.   h) In order to fund the acquisition of DPLI from DHFL, DIL issued and allotted 190.10 crores Compulsorily Convertible Debentures (CCDs) of face value of \\\\\\\\u20b910 each to WGC. The CCDs were to be converted into equity shares of DIL after the expiry of 100 months and not later than 110 months, from the date on which the CCDs were issued, in accordance with the terms. As per the explanatory statement to the notice of postal ballot, WGC funded the acquisition of the CCDs through its internal accruals and through market borrowings. The aforesaid CCDs were pledged by WGC as collateral in favour of the lenders (i.e. Mutual Funds). Also, an unconditional put option was issued by DHFL in favour of theAdjudication order in the matter of Transaction of the shares held by DHFL in DHFL Pramerica Life Insurance Company Ltd. and related matters thereof                                      Page 5 of 22 CCD holders. Investment of WGC in the CCDs of DIL was worth Rs. 1901 crores \\\\\\\\u2013 part financed by ABMF investment of Rs.1100 crores in NCDs of WGC and by Franklin Templeton investment of 500 crores in NCD of WGC.  i) WGC would, post conversion of the CCDs, own a majority of the issued and paid-up share capital of DIL. Thus, after 100 months but not more than 110 months, WGC would hold more than 50% in DIL, which was wholly owned subsidiary of DHFL earlier.  j) Examination was undertaken for the issues such as whether all relevant details of the transactions were made available by DHFL to its shareholders so as to enable them to make an informed decision and whether the transactions were profitable and in favor of promoters of DHFL as against the interests of the public shareholders. Examination revealed that the shareholders were aware about the DHFL\\\\\\\\u2019s investment in DPLI, reason for the proposed transfer, funding for the transaction etc. However, no concrete details/ information regarding the Put options were available to the shareholders of DHFL while taking the decision for the related party transactions. The same can be seen from the content of the postal ballot, only the term used for options were \\\\\\\\u201ccertain options or such options\\\\\\\\u201d.  k) The following information were not available to the shareholders of DHFL in the notice of postal ballot dated February 14, 2017: i. The estimated size and amount of the CCDs issued by DIL was not disclosed by the company. The method for funding for acquisition was known to the shareholders of the Company, however the size and amount was not known. The information related to the upcoming debt of DIL was not available to the shareholders and the cost of that debt also not known which ultimately needs to be borne by the shareholders of DHFL. So, complete and adequate information was not available for decision making for related party transaction.  ii. The conversion ratio of CCD to equity shares, shareholding pattern of DIL post conversion of CCD and the rate of interest on the CCDs were not disclosed by the company. Conversion ratio of CCD to equity shares was not known and after conversion the shareholding pattern was also not clear to the shareholder. However, it was available that the majority will go to WGC but it was not known that what will be the non-majority part which is going to be with DHFL.  iii. Information about the options like terms of option agreement, cost or fee charged for the options, how CCDs would be transferred to DHFL andAdjudication order in the matter of Transaction of the shares held by DHFL in DHFL Pramerica Life Insurance Company Ltd. and related matters thereof                                      Page 6 of 22 impact on the shareholders of DHFL if options exercised by WGC etc., were not disclosed by the company. Terms and conditions of Put options were not available to the shareholders of DHFL. It was not known to the shareholder that these put options gives a right to WGC, to transfer the CCDs to DHFL and in that condition what cost would be borne by DHFL was also not known to the shareholders. Further, whether any cost or fee for these options was paid by WGC to the DHFL was also not available to the shareholders. It may be noted that consideration for the put option provided by DHFL was not paid by WGC to DHFL at the time of execution of the agreement. A fee of Rs. 1.9 crores were paid in June 2019, after around 2 years from the agreement execution date.  So, the shareholders of DHFL was only informed about the company\\\\\\\\u2019s investment in DPLI of Rs. 31.07 crores are getting converted into the range of 1690 crores to 2020 crores but the future cost of these put option which may be bigger than the abovementioned profit was not given to the shareholders. So, complete and adequate information was not available to the shareholder to take informed decision at the time of casting their vote in the resolution passed. iv. The fair market valuation ranges for the shares proposed to be transferred from DHFL to DIL is between Rs. 1690 crores to Rs. 2020 Crores. However, the exact fair market value was not disclosed by the company. The information related to the range of fair market valuation was provided in the notice of postal ballot. However, the exact fair market value for the transaction was not known to the shareholders.  l) In view of the above, information available to the shareholders was not adequate for an informed decision. The information available to the shareholders was only related to that the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s investment in DPLI of Rs. 31.07 crores which was getting converted into the range of Rs. 1690 crores to Rs. 2020 crores within a short span of time of around 3 years. The additional capital so raised by the company would be deployed towards expansion of the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s core business and/ or prepayment of its high cost borrowings. It is a matter of concern when approval was sought for a series of transactions i.e. from stake sale of DPLI to DIL by DHFL, issuance of CCDs to WGC in order to fund such acquisition and pledging of these CCDs by WGC for raising funds for acquisition of CCDs of DIL, the only document which was available for the inspection of shareholders was the \\\\\\\\u201cDraft Share Purchase Agreement (SPA)\\\\\\\\u201d, which only gives information about the stake sale of DPLI. The draft Share Purchase Agreement only gives information about the stake sale of DPLI but does not provide the information regarding estimated size and amount of CCDs issued by DIL, conversion ratio ofAdjudication order in the matter of Transaction of the shares held by DHFL in DHFL Pramerica Life Insurance Company Ltd. and related matters thereof                                      Page 7 of 22 CCDs, shareholding pattern of DIL post conversion of CCD, rate of interest of CCDs and the future cost would be borne by DHFL due to conditions of Put options etc. No documents/ information were available to the shareholders related to CCDs and Options. When all the series of events were pre-decided, documents/ draft agreements should have been made available to the shareholders for each and every events in order to enable them to an informed decision. So, the complete and adequate information was not available to the shareholders of DHFL.   m) It was also examined whether the transactions were profitable and in favour of promoters of DHFL as against the interests of the public shareholders. To see the profitability of the transaction, there could be two scenarios on the basis of the probability of future performance of DPLI.  Scenario A: In the event that DHFL Pramerica Life Insurance did well and the value of DIL shareholding in it went up, say from Rs. 2000 crores to Rs. 4000 crores, WGC would extract this value through the conversion of its CCDs of Rs. 1901 crores and effectively after repaying its lenders along with interest and would be the 100% beneficiary of the profit. While the shareholders of DHFL would benefit in this scenario on account of their shareholding in DIL then would have zero participation in the profit accruing in the CCDs.  Scenario B: If DHFL Life Insurance failed and its value falls from Rs. 2000 crores to say, Rs. 1000 crores, the WGC would not be in a position to extract enough value through the CCDs and would potentially be unable to pay the NCD holders. In this scenario as per the put option agreement entered into with DHFL (which has not been placed before the shareholders), the Lender would put the CCD on DHFL, who would have to pay Rs. 1901 crores plus interest of 9.95% p.a, while getting in return, the CCDs of value of only Rs. 1000 crores approx. In this scenario the minority shareholders of DHFL would have to bear 62.62 % of the loss, accruing to the CCDs, the balance 37.38% being borne by WGC by virtue of their holding in DHFL. In view of the above, as against the benefit which they had already got from the stake sale of Rs. 31.07 crores to Rs. 2000.5 crores in DPLI, their net benefit would reduce. As mentioned above, possibility of both the scenario was there and depended on the future performance of the DPLI.   n) As mentioned above, possibility of both the scenarios was there and depended on the future performance of the DPLI. In scenario 1, the minority shareholders of DHFL only gets profit by virtue of their shareholding in DIL, whereas WGC firstAdjudication order in the matter of Transaction of the shares held by DHFL in DHFL Pramerica Life Insurance Company Ltd. and related matters thereof                                      Page 8 of 22 enjoys the benefit of interest received on the CCDs issued by DIL and then profit by virtue of majority shareholding in DIL after the conversion of CCDs into equity shares of DIL. In scenario 2, the minority shareholder of DHFL would have to bear 62.62% of the loss, accruing to the CCDs and only 37.38% being borne by WGC by virtue of their holding in DHFL. With the put option, WGC will be in a win-win situation, if DPLI does well and makes profit, WGC will hold the majority stake in DIL after conversion of CCDs to the equity shares of DIL. However, in case DPLI does not perform well, CCDs of DIL will be transferred to DHFL and DHFL have to pay the consideration to WGC. So, the loss would be borne by the shareholders of the DHFL. The complete and adequate information was not presented before the shareholders of DHFL while taking the approval for the related party transaction. Benefit of the stake sale of DPLI of Rs. 31.07 crore to Rs. 2000.50 crore was showcased but the condition of put option and effects of the put option on the shareholders of DHFL was not disclosed to the shareholders. So the transaction with the put option of DHFL is asymmetric in favour of the promoters of DHFL and against the minority shareholders.  o) Thus, it was observed during the examination that the complete and adequate information was not disclosed to the shareholders of the Company. (Notice of Postal ballot and Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) are placed at Annexure-2). The whole chain of events/ series of events were designed in such a way as to give benefits to the promoters (WGC) of the Company and could cause future loss for the minority shareholders resulting into asymmetry in favor of the promoters & against minority shareholders of DHFL. Incomplete disclosure defeats the entire purpose of having the resolution approved by the shareholders and is against the principles of good corporate governance.   p) In view of the above, Noticee has allegedly violated the principles governing disclosures and obligations prescribed under Regulation 4 (1) (e) of LODR Regulations r/w Section 21 of SCRA by not disclosing the information of CCDs and Put Options and taking the approval from the shareholders of the company for the subjected related party transaction without giving complete and adequate information as mentioned in aforesaid paras.  4.

Thereafter, vide Order dated July 6, 2018, Shri. Satya Ranjan Prasad was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the said matter in the place of Shri Shri. Biju S. Later, vide order dated May 17, 2019 the undersigned has been appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the instant matter. The proceeding is therefore being carried forward where they had been left off by the previous AO and an opportunity of personal hearing was granted as detailed hereinafter.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING    3. A Show Cause Notice dated May 5, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued by the erstwhile AO to the Noticees in terms of Section 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 4 of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d), and Section 23-I of the  SCRA,  1956 read  with  Rule  4  of the Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)(Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 2005  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  \\\\\\\\u201cSCR  Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against the Noticees and why penalty should not be imposed on the Noticees under the provisions of Section 23E of SCR  Act, 1956 and Sections 15HA and 15HB of the SEBI Act, for the aforesaid alleged violations.  The SCN was duly served upon the Noticees.  4. The SCN was issued to the Noticees alleging, inter alia, that:  (a) The Company was constantly misleading the stock-exchanges, FCCBs holders, regarding the utilization of the proceeds of FCCBs, restructuring process and also regarding the expected proceeds to be realized from the redemption of restructured investments, which did not happen. (b) The Company being fully cognizant of the impeding obligation towards Adjudication Order in respect of Shri Pankaj Kumar, Shri Prashant Mulekar and Shri Kiran Kulkarni in the matter of M/s Geodesic Limited                                                                                    Page 4 | 40     redemption of FCCBs (for an amount of approximately INR 800 Crore) and was also aware about its dismal financial health, still made announcements for buy-back of shares as well as proposed for payment of dividends. After making such announcements, the Company did not take any step either towards the buy-back or payment of dividends. (c) Both the announcements pertaining to buy-back and payment of dividend had positively impacted the price of the scrip of the Company. The market price of the scrip of the Company on November 21, 2012 (date of notice of Board Meeting) was INR 38.45 and on November 27, 2012 (date of Board Meeting wherein decision to buy-back was taken) the price was INR 52.20. Similarly, the market price of the scrip on November 23, 2012 (one day prior to date of notice of Board Meeting on November 24, 2012, which was Saturday) was INR 38.60 and on December 03, 2012 (date of Board Meeting wherein decision to consider paying dividend was taken) was INR 51.60. (d) The sequence of events indicates that the intention behind making announcements of buy-back and payment of dividend despite knowing the financial incapacity to honour  the same, was to positively influence the price of the scrip of the Company. (e) ICICI Bank Limited had filed an application before Debt Recovery Tribunal (\\\\\\\\u2018DRT\\\\\\\\u2019) for recovery of 70.52 crore from the Company. DRT passed an interim order on 19/03/2013, freezing its bank accounts. DRT, vide its order dated 05/04/2013, directed continuation of freeze on the company's account, which would have been sufficient to cover the liability of the company towards the applicant. However, Company did not make any disclosure to stock exchange regarding the order passed by DRT in the suit filed against the company. The email dated March 24, 2015 from BSE confirming that no specific disclosure regarding the suit filed in DRT against the company in the year 2013 is enclosed as Annexure V. It is therefore, alleged that the Noticees have violated Clause 36 of Listing Agreement read with Section 21 of SCR Act, 1956 and Clause 2.1 & 7(ii) of Schedule II read with Regulation 12(2) of PIT Regulations, 1992 read with Regulation 12(2) of PIT Adjudication Order in respect of Shri Pankaj Kumar, Shri Prashant Mulekar and Shri Kiran Kulkarni in the matter of M/s Geodesic Limited                                                                                    Page 5 | 40     Regulations, 2015. (f) Clause 49 of Listing Agreement requires that where the Chairman of the Board is a non-executive director, at least one-third of the Board should comprise of independent directors and in case he is an executive director, at least half of the Board should comprise of independent directors. However, there was only one independent director in the company after February 22, 2013 along with three executive directors in the Board, which is not in compliance with the Listing Agreement. (g) Clause 4.2 of Schedule I Part A, inter alia, provides that all directors/ officers/ designated employees who buy or sell any number of shares of the company shall not enter into an opposite transaction i.e. sell or buy any number of shares during the next six months following the prior transaction. However, it was observed that the Noticee no. 2, Director, entered into opposite transactions during the investigation period.  5. The SCN dated May 05, 2016 was served upon the Noticees by way of registered post. In response to this, Noticee No. 3 requested for some additional time to file its reply to the SCN. Subsequently, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticees on September 12, 2016 vide Hearing Notice dated September 01, 2016. In response to this, Noticee No. 3 requested for short adjournment in the matter due to his recent release from the judicial custody. Accordingly, the Noticees were given another opportunity of personal hearing on September 22, 2016. The said hearing was attended by Authorized Representative (AR) of Noticee No. 1 and 3, in which he requested for some additional time to file its detailed reply to the SCN. Subsequently, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticees on October 20, 2016. The said hearing was attended by the AR of Noticee No. 1 & 3 in which it filed its reply to the SCN on behalf of Noticee No. 1 & 3 vide its letters dated October 19, 2016. The AR made further submissions in the matter vide its letter Adjudication Order in respect of Shri Pankaj Kumar, Shri Prashant Mulekar and Shri Kiran Kulkarni in the matter of M/s Geodesic Limited                                                                                    Page 6 | 40     dated November 15, 2016. The submissions made by AR of Noticee 1 & 3 are summarized as below:  i. At the outset we deny all the allegations made against them in the SCN. ii. At present, the Official Liquidator has taken the charge of assets and properties of the Company and therefore the said Noticees do not have access to the records pertaining to the Company and accordingly, the reply is filed based on the limited records/information available with the said Noticees. iii. The Company also has 5 foreign subsidiary companies viz., Emiloto Associates Inc. & Zomo Technologies Limited (in British Virgin Islands); GTSL in Hong Kon; GHL in Mauritius; and Geodesic Information Systems Inc. in USA. iv. The Company got listed on 2002 and from 2004 to 2011, the Company had paid dividends every year, total amounting to INR 96 Crore. v. The Company had numerous innovative products and had clientele in both public as well as private sector. The Company had also won numerous international awards during relevant time. vi. The decision of buy-back was taken as the Board of Directors felt that the prevailing market price was low and the scrip was undervalued. A similar buy-back of upto 5% equity capital was already undertaken by the Company during the year 2010. vii. In terms of the FCCB Offering Circular, the proceeds of the FCCBs were invested along with internal accruals in overseas subsidiary companies set up by the Company or for acquisition of foreign companies directly or indirectly through the foreign subsidiaries. viii. There were total 11 such subsidiaries/step down subsidiaries which included GTSL, Hong Kong, Zomo Technologies and Emiloto Associated Inc (British Virgin Islands). The 100% shareholding of GTSL was with the Company and shareholding of rest of the aforesaid two companies was with Geodesic Holding Limited, Mauritius (a subsidiary of Geodesic Limited). Adjudication Order in respect of Shri Pankaj Kumar, Shri Prashant Mulekar and Shri Kiran Kulkarni in the matter of M/s Geodesic Limited                                                                                    Page 7 | 40     ix. The aforesaid three subsidiaries/step down subsidiaries had invested part of the money raised through FCCB issue in various funds outside India through certain foreign banks and details of such investment are tabulated herein below: (Table No. 1) Sr. No Name of subsidiary Name of fund Amount in USD Through/Managed by NAV (million USD) On Date 1. GTSL, Hong Kong Enterprise Emerging Market Fund 82 Million BSI Bank Singapore 82.02  22.02.2013 2. Zomo Technologies Limited Absolute Diversified Growth Fund 87 Million Credit Suisse Bank, Zurich 94.18  31.01.2013 3. Emiloto Associated Inc Various liquid assets including Government securities and bonds# 29 Million HSBC, Zurich 29.05  23.01.2013 Total   198 Million  205.25  # A sum of USD 29.03 Million was invested by Emiloto in Audrain Commercial Corp., Belize (\\\\\\\\u201cAudrain\\\\\\\\u201d) in the form of a loan. As per agreement dated July 31, 2012 executed between Emiloto and Audrain, this loan was to be used by Audrain to search out for companies with innovative products and acquire them. If Emiloto was convinced about the validity of the product/technologies, they would acquire the companies in lieu of the loan/part thereof. Copy of agreement has also been filed in support.  x. They are not able to obtain copies of bank account statement to show the fund flows for the aforesaid transactions, copy of statements issued by aforesaid banks to show the Net Asset Value of aforesaid investment as USD 205 Million have been filed. Besides, the Company also estimated to collect revenue of USD 28 Million from GTSL\\\\\\\\u2019s business as on September 30, 2012 and as on September 30, 2012, the NAV of the investments made with HSBC was USD 29 Million. Adjudication Order in respect of Shri Pankaj Kumar, Shri Prashant Mulekar and Shri Kiran Kulkarni in the matter of M/s Geodesic Limited                                                                                    Page 8 | 40     xi. On the date of approval for proposal of buy-back (October 27, 2012) and even today, the Company has sufficient liquid assets to meet the financial requirements for buy-back amounting to INR 170 Crore. Similarly, in terms of letter dated January 21, 2013, addressed by HSBC to Emiloto Associated Inc (subsidiary of the Company), the assets in the account of HSBC are USD 29.05 Million, which shows that the Company had the financial strength for the requirement of buy-back. xii. Certain events like stay obtained by ICICI Bank and the apprehension created in the mind of the Directors of the Company that similar such stay would be obtained for buy-back also; and the difficulty faced in the redemption of FCCBs due to erroneous information furnished by Citibank NA, together made it impossible for the Company to carry out the buy-back. xiii. Since the Company and its subsidiaries were not able to liquidate their investments, the Company could not comply with the directions of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Bombay High Court, which led to appointment of Provisional Liquidator for the Company. xiv. The Company never misled the stock exchanges or the FCCBs holders. The proceeds of FCCBs were invested in subsidiaries and well recognized funds in Singapore/Zurich. The investment of USD 176 Million in BIS Singapore and Credit Suisse was open ended and thus liquid. Only 20% of such proceeds were invested to explore and invest in new innovations. xv. Due to the actions taken by various banks like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank etc., for recovery of loans, and action of demand initiated by Citibank NA, it resulted in a situation where the subsidiaries of the Company could not act to liquidate the assets and repay bondholders. Further, due to appointment of Official Liquidator, the Directors lost control of the Company due to which the business of Company completely stopped. xvi. The above shows that there was actual intention of buy-back on part of the Company, however, it could not be completed due to reason stated above. xvii. For the purpose of payment of dividend, a sum of only INR 18 Crore was required and the Company along with its subsidiaries had USD 200 Million in Adjudication Order in respect of Shri Pankaj Kumar, Shri Prashant Mulekar and Shri Kiran Kulkarni in the matter of M/s Geodesic Limited                                                                                    Page 9 | 40     investments. Till November 24, 2012, there were no legal restrictions on payment of dividends, however, only on December 28, 2012, a stay order against the Company from declaring and paying dividend was obtained by ICICI Bank. Therefore, the allegation that the Company had no intention to pay dividend is erroneous. xviii. It cannot be said the buy-back or proposal for dividend were the only reasons due to which the price of the scrip increased. The price of the scrip decreased due to various reasons like recovery actions from banks, failure of the key product and loss suffered by the Company in derivatives. xix. As per the estimates of the Company, INR 838 Crore were required for redemption of FCCBs on January 18, 2013 and around INR 170 Crore (USD 31.80 Million) were required for the buy-back of shares and INR 18 Crore (USD 3 Million) were required for the payout of dividends. The total money for all the said aspects was INR 1,026 Crore (192.50 Million USD by conversion rate of INR 53/- prevalent at relevant time). xx. It is clear that at the time of announcing buy-back of shares and declaration of dividends in November, 2012, the Company had sufficient financial requirements to meet the aforesaid disclosures. By the end of February, 2013, the Company had sufficient financial resources to meet the aforesaid announcements as well as those of the redemption of FCCBs. xxi. Around December, 2012, a key product which was marketed by the Company through GTSL faced certain technical issues. As the technical issues could not be fixed the clients demanded for retraction of invoices for the period of 2011-2013 and also sought return of cheques issued by such clients to GTSL. xxii. In order to retain the clients (who were using other products of the Company also), it was decided to forego the amounts due to the Company and cheques were not encashed. The same led to damage to the clients of the Company as well as its subsidiary GTSL. As the Company had raised invoices on GTSL for the said product, the Company also suffered a loss of INR 159 Crore. There is no document available Adjudication Order in respect of Shri Pankaj Kumar, Shri Prashant Mulekar and Shri Kiran Kulkarni in the matter of M/s Geodesic Limited                                                                                    Page 10 | 40     in support of all this, except copy of Annual Report for 2012-13, which also mentions these facts. xxiii. The Company had taken a loan of INR 55 Crore (Out of the sanctioned limit of INR 130 Crore) in June, 2012 from ICICI Bank for working capital and for the purposes of hedging its exposure to foreign currency by entering into Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts. Certain payments towards interest etc., as demanded by the bank during October/December, 2012 were made by the Company. The said loan was due for repayment on December 31, 2012, however due to compromised cash flow, the Company vide its letter dated February 22, 2013, requested the bank for rescheduling the repayment of loan. xxiv. On December 28, 2012, ICICI Bank had obtained a stay order on payout of the proposed dividend by the Company. Copy of loan agreement, demand notices, stay order have been filed in support thereof. xxv. As the Company intended to repay the loan amounts due to ICICI Bank and obtain approval of the shareholders thereafter, such stay order was not challenged by the Company in any court of law. In the AGM dated February 11, 2013, the shareholders resolved to approve declaration of dividend subject to permission being obtained from ICICI Bank or payment of the loan due to the bank. xxvi. As the Company apprehended that a similar stay against buy-back may also be taken by the bank, it decided to defer the payout of dividends till such loan is repaid and FCCBs were redeemed. The Company had also decided to reschedule the AGM of shareholders from December 30, 2012 to February 11, 2013 and permission for rescheduling the same was obtained by RoC. In pursuance of said decision, the agenda of buy-back of shares was not included in the list of agendas for said AGM. However, during the AGM, it was clarified to its shareholders that proposed buy-back has only been deferred till completion of redemption of FCCBs. xxvii.  Till January, 2013, the Trustees of FCCBs holders, viz., Citibank NA, had advised the Company that FCCBs could be redeemed by overseas subsidiaries/step down subsidiaries. However, around January 2013, Citibank NA informed the Company that the Company and not its subsidiaries had to redeem the FCCBs. In Adjudication Order in respect of Shri Pankaj Kumar, Shri Prashant Mulekar and Shri Kiran Kulkarni in the matter of M/s Geodesic Limited                                                                                    Page 11 | 40     order to bring the funds invested in the subsidiaries, the Company would have to restructure its holdings which involved valuation of overseas subsidiaries. The said process could not have been completed by January 18, 2013, due to which the Company sought 45 days\\\\\\\\u2019 time for redemption. xxviii. Due to circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the restructuring could not be achieved within the expected time frame and in May, 2013, the Trustees issued a demand notice for redemption of the FCCBs.\\\\\\\\u201d xxix. Since March 19, 2013, operation of almost all the bank accounts of the Company were stopped by ICICI Bank by obtaining an ex parte stay order dated March 19, 2013 from the DRT. As. a result, the Company's business operations virtually came to a standstill and by oversight, the Company omitted to inform the stock exchanges regarding the said stay order.  6. Additionally, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to Noticee No. 2 on October 19, 2016 vide Hearing Notice dated October 07, 2016. In response to this, the Noticee vide its letter dated October 13, 2016 informed SEBI that he is unable to attend the hearing as he is currently in judicial custody.  7. Subsequently, pursuant to the appointment of the undersigned as the AO in the matter, an opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticees on April 23, 2021 vide email dated March 24, 2021 which was later rescheduled on June 17, 2021 and again on July 05, 2021 on the request of AR of Noticee No. 1 & 3. The said hearing was attended by the AR of Noticee No. 1 & 3 in which it reiterated its submissions made vide its earlier replies. However, no response was received from Noticee No. 2 in this regard.  8. It is noted from the records that the Noticee No. 2 has not participated in the present proceedings and has addressed certain communications with requests to adjourn the proceedings as he is in judicial custody. In this connection, I note that the present matter is very old as the alleged violations pertain to the period Adjudication Order in respect of Shri Pankaj Kumar, Shri Prashant Mulekar and Shri Kiran Kulkarni in the matter of M/s Geodesic Limited                                                                                    Page 12 | 40     of 2012-2013. The SCN was issued in the year 2016, however, based on the repeated requests received from the Noticees, including the Noticee No. 2 regarding his inability to present his case, the personal hearing in the matter was adjourned time and again. It is well recognized that any situation of a delinquent being restrained from presenting his case due to certain physical restrictions like being in judicial custody deserves lenient view. However, when the matter is examined holistically, it is observed that adequate opportunities have already been granted to the Noticees to present their case and in absence of any fixed time frame being indicated to me for removal of physical restrictions on the Noticee No. 2, it would not be in the fitness of things to keep the matter pending infinitely. Accordingly, vide email dated March 24, 2021, the Noticee No. 2 was provided with a last opportunity to file his response to the SCN. The said email was duly delivered to the Noticee No. 2. I, therefore find that adequate opportunities have been given to the Noticee No. 2 and in absence of any response on his behalf or about his present status it is not known as to when the Noticee No. 2 will be available to attend the personal hearing before me. Further, Noticee No. 2 was at liberty to engage an Authorised Representative/Counsel to present his case in his defence but he has not taken any step in this regard either. Under the circumstances, I have no other option but to proceed to deal with the matter based on the materials available on records.  9. Taking into account the aforesaid facts, I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been followed in the matter by granting the Noticees opportunities of being heard and submit its reply in the matter. Therefore, I deem it appropriate to decide the matter on the basis of facts/material available on record.   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES, EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS Adjudication Order in respect of Shri Pankaj Kumar, Shri Prashant Mulekar and Shri Kiran Kulkarni in the matter of M/s Geodesic Limited                                                                                    Page 13 | 40     10. I have taken into consideration the facts and material available on record wherein it is alleged that the Noticees have violated various provisions of SCR Act, 1956, PIT Regulations 1992/2015, Sebi Act and PFUTP Regulations.  I have the following issues for consideration, viz.,  I. Whether the Noticees have violated the provisions of the SEBI Act, SCR Act, 1956, PIT Regulations 1992/2015 and PFUTP Regulations, 2003?  II. Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Sections 23E of SCR Act, 1956 and Sections 15 HA and 15HB of SEBI Act.?  III.

However, on the basis of available material obtained from SEBI the following submissions with respect to complaints received for clients are made; a. Ms. Shashi Kala and Mr. Vasant Kumar Rathod With respect to Ms. Shashi Kala, the matter was amicably resolved.  b. Mr. Khoyendra Pande With respect to Mr. Khoyendra Pande, the matter is still pending for resolution and before a resolution could be arrived, the criminal proceedings were initiated. c. Mr. Parshuram Chaupal Does not have any relevant material on record with respect to said client to reply and comment. d. Ms. Meena Hemant Padia The matter is still pending for resolution and the claim of the complainant is not valid, all services as subscribed by the client were given and therefore, allegations of the complainant are denied.  13.2. Trade India has denied the declaration statement given by employees Mr. Gaurav Garg and Ms. Abhilasha Mishra.  13.3. Denies all allegation levelled against them in the Interim Order   Confirmatory Order in the matter of Trade India Research          Page 7 of 11 13.4. In the absence of material information on hand and in the larger interest of justice, sought merciful approach  14. During the personal hearing on April 07, 2021, the legal representative of Trade India was advised to provide the response to the application made by Trade India seeking necessary documents from the Police Authority. The legal representative was also advised that if the request application has not yet been made, to make a fresh application to obtain all necessary documents from the Police Authority for submissions on merit. However, no reply or status update was received from the legal representative or Trade India till date.  Consideration of Issues:    15. I have considered the oral and written submissions made by all the Noticees. The issue to be considered at this stage is as follows:   Whether in light of the facts and circumstances of the case, the findings of the Interim Order and the submissions of the Noticee/s in response thereto, the directions issued against the Noticee/s vide the Interim Order needs to be confirmed, revoked or modified in any manner?    16. I note that, Trade India has not made any submissions on merits or placed any contrary facts/evidences with respect to the findings in the Interim Order as brought out in paragraph 6 above.   17. Further no reply or confirmation of compliance of the Interim Order has been received from the five Employee-Noticees on the directions against them in the Interim Order.   Confirmatory Order in the matter of Trade India Research          Page 8 of 11 18. With respect to the reference complaints taken up for preliminary examination as detailed in paragraph 4 above, the following is noted;  18.1. Trade India has mentioned that, the complaints of Ms. Shashi Kala and Mr. Vasant Kumar Rathod have been amicably resolved, however, Trade India has not provided any details on the resolution of the complaints or contrary facts/evidences controverting the findings arising out of reference complaints in the Interim Order.   18.2. With reference to complaints of Mr. Khoyendra Pande and Mr. Parshuram Chaupal, Trade India has mentioned that the complaints could not be resolved as criminal proceeding were initiated and they do not have any relevant material on record for resolution. I note that, Trade India was given opportunity of inspection on April 01, 2021, and the documents available on record with SEBI were also provided to Trade India to make submissions on merits. Further, Trade India was also advised to provide the response to the application claimed to have been made to the Police Authority by Trade India seeking necessary documents or to make an application if not already made, to obtain all necessary documents for submissions. No reply or response has been received till date.  18.3. For the complaint of Ms. Meena Hemant Padia, Trade India has denied the allegations stating that \\\\\\\\u2018all services as subscribed were given\\\\\\\\u2019. It is noted that, complaints are only a trigger for examination of activities of IA and unearth large extent of the violations of the securities laws / regulatory provisions. Further, the underlying issue here is of compliance with regulations, code of conduct and due diligence by the IA. Trade India has not made any submission on the findings as detailed in the interim order. Therefore, without providing any reasoning/documentary evidence controverting the findings arising out of   Confirmatory Order in the matter of Trade India Research          Page 9 of 11 the complaint of Ms. Meena Hemant Padia and other findings based on the examination, the contention of Trade India is not acceptable.  19. I note that Trade India has denied statement of declaration by employees, Mr. Gaurav Garg and Ms. Abhilasha Mishra, without any evidences direct or circumstantial to the effect as to why the statement of declaration cannot be relied upon and considered as declaration of the activities of Trade India. I also note here that, though Trade India has merely denied the statement of declaration of the two employees, it has not specifically denied the communications with the complainants, nor provided any contradictory facts thereto. On the contrary, the existence of the statement of declaration of Mr. Gaurav Garg, Legal and Compliance Manager and Ms. Abhilasha Mishra, Compliance Executive, of Trade India and the material available on record (official communications Trade India with complainants) substantiate that the statement of declaration and communications cannot be simply disbelieved without any attendant circumstances being shown. Thus, submission of Trade India is not acceptable. Here a reference may be drawn to the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court order in the matter of SEBI v. Kishore R. Ajmera (2016) 6 SCC 368, where it was held that, the immediate and proximate facts and circumstances surrounding the events and the context of the communications and basis of preponderance of probability, reasonable conclusion through inferential process has been drawn, that the communication are of Noticee in this respect.  20. Trade India has mentioned that, Police raided and sealed the office and that there is a criminal proceeding pending before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court, and accordingly Trade India is not bound by Interim Order. I note here that, Trade India has not submitted any material to indicate that this proceeding is related or dependent on the proceeding initiated before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court nor has provided any document in support that the Interim Order has been stayed/set-aside by any   Confirmatory Order in the matter of Trade India Research          Page 10 of 11 competent Court/Tribunal. Therefore, the Interim order is binding on Trade India. The same was notified to Trade India vide letter dated September 29, 2020. Further, Trade India has mentioned that they do not have access to the office premises and documents as the office is sealed and closed by the Police Authority. In this respect, I note that, Trade India was given opportunity of inspection on April 01, 2021, and all the documents available on record with SEBI were provided to Trade India. Further, Trade India was instructed during the personal hearing to provide the response from the Police Authority for the application claimed to have been made seeking necessary documents, and if not already made to make an application to the Police Authority, to obtain all necessary documents for necessary submissions on merit. However, no reply or response has been received till date from Trade India. It may also be noted that, SEBI proceedings are independent of any action by the Police Authority and therefore, the prayer of Trade India for relief citing these reasons cannot be considered.  21. In view of the above and the findings in the Interim Order, I note that the submissions/contentions of Trade India are devoid of merit and therefore cannot be accepted.   22. In view of the consideration of material available on record including submissions made by Trade India, the findings in the Interim Order as mentioned in paragraph 6 above continues to stand at prima facie level. Hence, I find that Trade India is, prima facie, in contravention of various provisions of, SEBI Act 1992, IA Regulations and PFUTP Regulations, as outlined in the Interim Order. Further no reply or response from the Employee-Noticees has been received. Hence, there is no justifiable reason to modify the findings against the Employee-Noticees. In view of this, there is no justifiable reason for revocation or modifications of the directions issued against all the Noticees vide the Interim Order.   Confirmatory Order in the matter of Trade India Research          Page 11 of 11 Order:   23. In view of the foregoing paragraphs, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me by virtue of Section 19 read with Sections 11, 11B(1) and 11D of the SEBI Act, 1992, and Regulation 35 of Chapter VI of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008, thereof, hereby confirm the directions against all the Noticees issued vide Interim Order dated December 13, 2019, in the matter of Trade India Research.  24.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) conducted investigation in the scrip of Jaybharat Textiles & Real Estate Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cJTREL\\\\\\\\u201d) and KSL and Industries Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cKSLIL\\\\\\\\u201d), companies promoted by Saurabh Kumar Tayal, for the period October 23, 2006 to December 31, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Investigation Period/IP\\\\\\\\u2019). However, wherever necessary, reference to period before and after IP has also been made. During the period October 23, 2006 to August 28, 2007, the scrip of JTREL moved up from Rs. 93.10 to Rs. 192, resulting in a price rise of 106% and KSLIL moved up from Rs. 73 to Rs. 268 resulting in a price rise of 267%.Adjudication order in the matter of Jaybharat Textiles and Real Estate Ltd. & KSL and Industries Ltd.                               Page 3 of 181  2. Investigation revealed that promoters of the Companies along with their connected entities with the common understanding have acquired and actually held shares in scrip of JTREL and in the scrip of KSLIL which is far in excess of what has been declared by them publicly. Investigations also revealed that the promoters of JTREL & KSLIL have been able to disguise the extent of the shareholding in both the companies in a devious manner through the artifice of holding the shares of their company through their benami, in most cases their employees or workers. Investigation further revealed that some of the above entities continuously dealt in the shares of KSLIL and JTREL and created artificial volumes in the said scrips.

Investigations also revealed that the promoters of JTREL & KSLIL have been able to disguise the extent of the shareholding in both the companies in a devious manner through the artifice of holding the shares of their company through their benami, in most cases their employees or workers.

(Noticee 57)   4. It is alleged that Noticees No. 7, 11, 21 to 30 and 34 are the front/benami entities of promoters of JTREL. Further, it is alleged that these noticees held the shares of JTREL on behalf of the promoter of JTREL as they are mere employees of JTREL or other group companies of Tayal group. Further, it is also alleged that the Company never paid dividend to these entities and since they never enjoyed any dividend from the Company, it reinforces the argument that they are benami/front entities of promoters of JTREL. The dividend paid to these entities, was immediately transferred to other promoter related/controlled entities. 5. It is alleged that promoters of JTREL and KSL were using these bank accounts to transfer funds, route dividends from their connected entities to their other group companies. It is also alleged that 19 entities acted as front/benami entity for channeling the funds from one promoter connected entity to another. Further, these 19 entities acted in concert with promoters by being a front entity and held shares on behalf of promoters of JTREL.  6. It is alleged that Sanjay held shares worth of Rs. 155.13 crore as on February 11, 2010 and stays in a place which does not commensurate to his networth.

He did not trade in the shares of JTREL right from time he acquire the shares in the year 2003.  v. Nandkishore Panchal: Nandkishore Panchal resides at Panwala Chawl, Meghwadi, Jogeshwari, Mumbai. Further, Nandkishore, held 77,36,250 (2.02%) shares of JTREL in physical mode and as on February 11, 2010, the value of these shares was worth Rs.390 crore. However, Nandkishore name does not appear in the category of shareholders \"Public\" and holding more than 1% of the Total No. of Shares\\\\\\\\u201d before quarter ended December 2009. This discrepancy was brought out in the SEBI interim order dt 12/03/10 & subsequently in the quarter ended March 2010 name Nandkishore Panchal & others entities were disclosed under the category. It is alleged that Nandkishore was Person Acting in Concert (PAC) during the acquisition of BOR by the Tayal group. Therefore, it is alleged that promoters deliberately attempted to camouflage names of these front / benami entities including Nandkishore Panchal from the shareholders list who were merely an employees of the JTREL & other group companies. Nandkishore Panchal did not trade in the shares of JTREL since the time he acquire the shares in the year 2002. vi. Pramod Patil: Pramod Patil resides at 5/6, Spring Mill Compound, G D Ambedkar Road, Naigaon Dadar, Mumbai. He held 30,75,000(0.8%) shares of JTREL in physical mode and as on February 11, 2010 and the value of these shares were worth Rs.155 crore. It is alleged that Pramod was Director of Jayshree Sarees Ltd., (later changed to JTREL) which had already been acquired by Tayal family to the extent of 57.01% with Shri Saurabh Tayal as the Chairman. Pramod Patil did not trade in the shares of JTREL right from time he acquire the shares in the year 2002. vii. Rajesh Sharma: Rajesh Sharma resides at Yadav Gajraj Sadan, Janu Compound Shantaram Tala, Malad (E), Mumbai. He held 61,50,000 (1.61%) shares of JTREL in physical mode and as on February 11, 2010, the value of these shares was worth Rs.310 crore. It is gathered that he appeared as a Person Acting in Concert (PAC) during the acquisition of BOR. Rajesh Sharma did not trade in the shares of JTREL right from time he acquire the shares in the year 2002. It is pertinent to note that in one of his reply letter to SEBI dated 31/03/10 Rajesh Sharma has submitted the annexure stating that he has purchased 4000 shares (1.61%) of JTREL from Satyapriya Arya. It is gathered that Arya\\\\\\\\u2019s were erstwhile promoters of JTREL who transferred their holdings to Saurabh kumar Tayal & others during the open offer in year 2003. This indicates that Rajesh Sharma bought these shares in the physical form from one of the erstwhile promoters of JTREL. The fact that he was already acted as PAC in acquisition of Bank of Rajasthan, it can be inferred that Rajesh SharmaAdjudication order in the matter of Jaybharat Textiles and Real Estate Ltd. & KSL and Industries Ltd.                               Page 10 of 181  acquired & holds these shares on behalf of current promoters without abiding to SEBI take over regulations.  Therefore nature of their holdings and the fact that these entities never dealt in the shares of JTREL strengthens that these entities are benami holder of shares of JTREL & hold shares on behalf of promoters.  7. Therefore, it is observed that these 20 entities are linked to the promoter\\\\\\\\u2019s viz. the Tayal\\\\\\\\u2019s through common addresses, or by their occupation in one of the promoters company or their associated companies or through web of common directorship in many unlisted companies which are also connected to promoters of JTREL & KSLIL. Therefore based on the above observations & their connections with promoters of JTREL & KSLIL and the manner in which they were not cooperative and procrastinating the process of investigation, it can be inferred that aforesaid entities are acting in concert with promoters and hold shares of JTREL & KSLIL on behalf of them as their front/benami entities. Many of them did not trade in the share of JTREL since the time they acquired these shares. Besides if, they traded it was only in the scrip of JTREL and KSLIL. Had their investments be genuine they would have dealt in other shares just as any other normal investors and would have taken some profits through sale of shares. These entities therefore are dormant / passive entities engaged by promoter to have a camouflaged control over floating stock, which will facilitate them to manipulate the price of scrip effortlessly.   8. The shareholding pattern of JTREL for the quarters ended March 2003- December 2009 are as follows: Quarterly Shareholdings\\\\\\\\u2192 / Categories \\\\\\\\u2193 % shareholdings for Quarter endings Mar 2003 June 2003 June 2004 Sep 2004 Dec 2004 Sep 2005 Mar 2006 Sep 2006 Mar 2007 Sep 2007 June 2009 Sep 2009 Dec 2009 Shareholding of Promoter and Promoter Group  57.02 68.55 73.37 68.55 68.55 68.55 68.55 68.55 68.55 68.55 67.05 67.05 67.05 Institutions                 0.61 0.61 0.61 0.61 0.61 Bodies Corporate     0.02 1.20 1.20 0.72 0.79 0.78 0.16 0.18 0.70 0.71 0.71 Individual shareholders holding nominal share capital up to Rs. 1 lakh 42.98 31.45 26.61 30.24 30.24 30.72 30.66 12.33 2.45 2.41 3.88 3.88 3.88 Individual shareholders holding nominal share capital in excess of Rs. 1 lakh 18.44 28.23 28.25 27.75 27.75 27.75 Total  100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 Between March 03 and March-06 Individuals holding up to1 lakh and in excess of 1 Lakh did not exist as separate categories   9. Based on the above mentioned shareholding pattern and data provided by RTA, the following are observed: i. Out of 19 as disclosed in the shareholding pattern, in respect of 13 entities the percentage of shareholdings remains the same since 2002-03 till date and these 13 entities were holding shares only in physical form and have not sold even a single share in the market over such a long period. Such holding pattern is similar to that of persons who are promoters of a company. The holding of the 19 entities range from a minimum of 1,05,951 shares to maximum of 1,75,12,125 shares. ii. Between the quarters ended September 2006 and 2007 Dhananjay Kandhare, Dinesh Dongre, Hitesh Dodiya, Nitish Nayak, Satish Pusalkar and Mahendra Kumar Panchal have appeared as new shareholders. Dhananjay Kandhare alone holds shares in physical form and the others are holding shares in demat form. It is noted that all these entities opened their demat account with the same Depository Participant, Keynote Capital Ltd, on the same day i.e. September 17, 2002.  iii. Another entity Jayesh V Merchant, appeared for the first time at quarter ended September 30, 2006 with a holding of 2,50,000 (0.49%) shares. Subsequently the holdings increased to 12,50,000 (post split/bonus) and he then transferred this entire holding to Envair Realty Pvt Ltd. (Noticee No. 54) through off-market route on January 12, 2009 (3,02,050 shares), January 13, 2009 (2,47,520 shares), January 21, 2009 (1,75,000 shares), January 21, 2009 (2,79,880 shares), January 22, 2009 (2,45,000 shares). It is gathered that Subashchandra Nigam and Chandrashekhar R Pandey, directors of Envair Realty Pvt Ltd, were earlier directors of JTREL. The shareholding of 0.49% shifted from one connected entity to another but the total number of shares under the camouflaged control of the Tayal group did not change and remained atAdjudication order in the matter of Jaybharat Textiles and Real Estate Ltd. & KSL and Industries Ltd.                               Page 11 of 181  28.24% since September 2006. Such camouflage has left shareholders in the dark since 2002 and investors have traded shares with misleading information on the company and the control of its promoters. iv. On comparing the RTA data with the data publicly disclosed on BSE website it is observed that in respect of five entities viz, Gopal Aggarwal, Milind Mhatre, Nandkishor Panchal, Rupesh Narvekar and Sandip Murkar, though they have been holding more than 1% of share capital of the company since 2003, their names were not shown on BSE website under that category. Therefore it appears that JTREL has deliberately withheld disclosures to the public thereby giving misleading information.  v. As per data of RTA, there are only 20 entities under the public category of \\\\\\\\u2018Individuals holding nominal share capital in excess of Rs. 1 lakh\\\\\\\\u2019 and their total shareholding remained unchanged at 1,44,14,869 shares constituting 28.24% of share capital. Yet, as on September 30, 2006, the company disclosed to the stock exchange 94,14,869 shares under this category that constituted only 18.44% of share capital and a holding of 9.8% was added under the category of \\\\\\\\u2018Individuals holding nominal share capital upto Rs. 1 lakh\\\\\\\\u2019, which displayed a holding of 12.33%. Even the smallest holding among these 19 persons was greater than 1 lakh shares. Therefore for a share of face value of Rs 5/- it is impossible and incorrect for any of these 20 entities to be shown in the retail investor category. It appears that the company desired to project (falsely) that retail category shareholders had acquired shares in the company for the first time, thereby indicating misleadingly emergence of investor interest. vi. Through entities evidently under the control of the promoter group, the promoters have control over an additional 28.24% of share capital of the company, which is falsely declared as public shareholding and not included in promoter category.  vii. The total public holding displayed on the website of BSE was 31.44% as on December 31, 2004, which increased to 32.95% as at quarter ended December 2009. This public holding excludes the promoter holding and represents the free-float shareholding in a company which is a critical factor that influences the price of the shares ",

The investigation revealed that the promoters, along with connected entities, acquired and held shares in excess of what was publicly declared, using benami (proxy) entities to disguise their holdings. These entities also created artificial trading volumes to manipulate share prices. SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings against 57 entities for violations of various regulations, including the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations, 2003, and the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 1997.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) conducted investigation in the scrip of Jaybharat Textiles & Real Estate Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cJTREL\\\\\\\\u201d) and KSL and Industries Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cKSLIL\\\\\\\\u201d), companies promoted by Saurabh Kumar Tayal, for the period October 23, 2006 to December 31, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Investigation Period/IP\\\\\\\\u2019). However, wherever necessary, reference to period before and after IP has also been made. During the period October 23, 2006 to August 28, 2007, the scrip of JTREL moved up from Rs. 93.10 to Rs. 192, resulting in a price rise of 106% and KSLIL moved up from Rs. 73 to Rs. 268 resulting in a price rise of 267%.Adjudication order in the matter of Jaybharat Textiles and Real Estate Ltd. & KSL and Industries Ltd.                               Page 3 of 181  2. Investigation revealed that promoters of the Companies along with their connected entities with the common understanding have acquired and actually held shares in scrip of JTREL and in the scrip of KSLIL which is far in excess of what has been declared by them publicly. Investigations also revealed that the promoters of JTREL & KSLIL have been able to disguise the extent of the shareholding in both the companies in a devious manner through the artifice of holding the shares of their company through their benami, in most cases their employees or workers. Investigation further revealed that some of the above entities continuously dealt in the shares of KSLIL and JTREL and created artificial volumes in the said scrips. It is also observed that promoters utilized their connected entities for creating various layers of fund transfer among their connected entities to avoid any scrutiny.  3. Accordingly SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings vide order dated December 20, 2011 in the matter of Jaybharat Textiles and Real Estate Ltd. & KSL and Industries Ltd. against 57 entities for the alleged violation of provisions of Regulations 3 and 4 of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (\\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), Regulations 7, 8, 10 and 11 of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 1997 (\\\\\\\\u201cTakeover Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), Conditions of Listing Agreement under Section 21 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (\\\\\\\\u201cSCRA, 1956\\\\\\\\u201d) including conditions for continuous listing.

(Noticee 57)   4. It is alleged that Noticees No. 7, 11, 21 to 30 and 34 are the front/benami entities of promoters of JTREL. Further, it is alleged that these noticees held the shares of JTREL on behalf of the promoter of JTREL as they are mere employees of JTREL or other group companies of Tayal group. Further, it is also alleged that the Company never paid dividend to these entities and since they never enjoyed any dividend from the Company, it reinforces the argument that they are benami/front entities of promoters of JTREL. The dividend paid to these entities, was immediately transferred to other promoter related/controlled entities. 5. It is alleged that promoters of JTREL and KSL were using these bank accounts to transfer funds, route dividends from their connected entities to their other group companies. It is also alleged that 19 entities acted as front/benami entity for channeling the funds from one promoter connected entity to another. Further, these 19 entities acted in concert with promoters by being a front entity and held shares on behalf of promoters of JTREL.  6. It is alleged that Sanjay held shares worth of Rs. 155.13 crore as on February 11, 2010 and stays in a place which does not commensurate to his networth. Thus, it is alleged that Sanjay Gadade, held shares on behalf of the promoters and working at the directions of promoters.

Therefore, it is alleged that promoters deliberately camouflage the names of these front/benami entities including Sandip Murkar from the shareholders list who were merely an employees of the JTREL & other group companies. Sandip Murkar did not trade in the shares of JTREL right from time he acquire the shares in the year 2002.  ii.

Dhananjay Kandhare, holds 30,75,000 (0.8%) shares of JTREL in physical mode and as on February 11, 2010 value of these shares was worth Rs.155 crore. It is alleged that Dhananjay Director of Jayshree Sarees Ltd., (later changed to JTREL) which had already been acquired by Tayal family to the extent of 57.01% with Shri Saurabh Tayal as the Chairman. He did not trade in the shares of JTREL right from time he acquire the shares in the year 2003.  v. Nandkishore Panchal: Nandkishore Panchal resides at Panwala Chawl, Meghwadi, Jogeshwari, Mumbai. Further, Nandkishore, held 77,36,250 (2.02%) shares of JTREL in physical mode and as on February 11, 2010, the value of these shares was worth Rs.390 crore. However, Nandkishore name does not appear in the category of shareholders \"Public\" and holding more than 1% of the Total No. of Shares\\\\\\\\u201d before quarter ended December 2009. This discrepancy was brought out in the SEBI interim order dt 12/03/10 & subsequently in the quarter ended March 2010 name Nandkishore Panchal & others entities were disclosed under the category. It is alleged that Nandkishore was Person Acting in Concert (PAC) during the acquisition of BOR by the Tayal group. Therefore, it is alleged that promoters deliberately attempted to camouflage names of these front / benami entities including Nandkishore Panchal from the shareholders list who were merely an employees of the JTREL & other group companies. Nandkishore Panchal did not trade in the shares of JTREL since the time he acquire the shares in the year 2002. vi. Pramod Patil: Pramod Patil resides at 5/6, Spring Mill Compound, G D Ambedkar Road, Naigaon Dadar, Mumbai. He held 30,75,000(0.8%) shares of JTREL in physical mode and as on February 11, 2010 and the value of these shares were worth Rs.155 crore. It is alleged that Pramod was Director of Jayshree Sarees Ltd., (later changed to JTREL) which had already been acquired by Tayal family to the extent of 57.01% with Shri Saurabh Tayal as the Chairman. Pramod Patil did not trade in the shares of JTREL right from time he acquire the shares in the year 2002. vii. Rajesh Sharma: Rajesh Sharma resides at Yadav Gajraj Sadan, Janu Compound Shantaram Tala, Malad (E), Mumbai. He held 61,50,000 (1.61%) shares of JTREL in physical mode and as on February 11, 2010, the value of these shares was worth Rs.310 crore. It is gathered that he appeared as a Person Acting in Concert (PAC) during the acquisition of BOR. Rajesh Sharma did not trade in the shares of JTREL right from time he acquire the shares in the year 2002. It is pertinent to note that in one of his reply letter to SEBI dated 31/03/10 Rajesh Sharma has submitted the annexure stating that he has purchased 4000 shares (1.61%) of JTREL from Satyapriya Arya. It is gathered that Arya\\\\\\\\u2019s were erstwhile promoters of JTREL who transferred their holdings to Saurabh kumar Tayal & others during the open offer in year 2003. This indicates that Rajesh Sharma bought these shares in the physical form from one of the erstwhile promoters of JTREL. The fact that he was already acted as PAC in acquisition of Bank of Rajasthan, it can be inferred that Rajesh SharmaAdjudication order in the matter of Jaybharat Textiles and Real Estate Ltd. & KSL and Industries Ltd.                               Page 10 of 181  acquired & holds these shares on behalf of current promoters without abiding to SEBI take over regulations.  Therefore nature of their holdings and the fact that these entities never dealt in the shares of JTREL strengthens that these entities are benami holder of shares of JTREL & hold shares on behalf of promoters.  7. Therefore, it is observed that these 20 entities are linked to the promoter\\\\\\\\u2019s viz. the Tayal\\\\\\\\u2019s through common addresses, or by their occupation in one of the promoters company or their associated companies or through web of common directorship in many unlisted companies which are also connected to promoters of JTREL & KSLIL. Therefore based on the above observations & their connections with promoters of JTREL & KSLIL and the manner in which they were not cooperative and procrastinating the process of investigation, it can be inferred that aforesaid entities are acting in concert with promoters and hold shares of JTREL & KSLIL on behalf of them as their front/benami entities. Many of them did not trade in the share of JTREL since the time they acquired these shares. Besides if, they traded it was only in the scrip of JTREL and KSLIL. Had their investments be genuine they would have dealt in other shares just as any other normal investors and would have taken some profits through sale of shares. These entities therefore are dormant / passive entities engaged by promoter to have a camouflaged control over floating stock, which will facilitate them to manipulate the price of scrip effortlessly.   8. The shareholding pattern of JTREL for the quarters ended March 2003- December 2009 are as follows: Quarterly Shareholdings\\\\\\\\u2192 / Categories \\\\\\\\u2193 % shareholdings for Quarter endings Mar 2003 June 2003 June 2004 Sep 2004 Dec 2004 Sep 2005 Mar 2006 Sep 2006 Mar 2007 Sep 2007 June 2009 Sep 2009 Dec 2009 Shareholding of Promoter and Promoter Group  57.02 68.55 73.37 68.55 68.55 68.55 68.55 68.55 68.55 68.55 67.05 67.05 67.05 Institutions                 0.61 0.61 0.61 0.61 0.61 Bodies Corporate     0.02 1.20 1.20 0.72 0.79 0.78 0.16 0.18 0.70 0.71 0.71 Individual shareholders holding nominal share capital up to Rs. 1 lakh 42.98 31.45 26.61 30.24 30.24 30.72 30.66 12.33 2.45 2.41 3.88 3.88 3.88 Individual shareholders holding nominal share capital in excess of Rs. 1 lakh 18.44 28.23 28.25 27.75 27.75 27.75 Total  100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 Between March 03 and March-06 Individuals holding up to1 lakh and in excess of 1 Lakh did not exist as separate categories   9. Based on the above mentioned shareholding pattern and data provided by RTA, the following are observed: i. Out of 19 as disclosed in the shareholding pattern, in respect of 13 entities the percentage of shareholdings remains the same since 2002-03 till date and these 13 entities were holding shares only in physical form and have not sold even a single share in the market over such a long period. Such holding pattern is similar to that of persons who are promoters of a company. The holding of the 19 entities range from a minimum of 1,05,951 shares to maximum of 1,75,12,125 shares. ii. Between the quarters ended September 2006 and 2007 Dhananjay Kandhare, Dinesh Dongre, Hitesh Dodiya, Nitish Nayak, Satish Pusalkar and Mahendra Kumar Panchal have appeared as new shareholders. Dhananjay Kandhare alone holds shares in physical form and the others are holding shares in demat form. It is noted that all these entities opened their demat account with the same Depository Participant, Keynote Capital Ltd, on the same day i.e. September 17, 2002.  iii. Another entity Jayesh V Merchant, appeared for the first time at quarter ended September 30, 2006 with a holding of 2,50,000 (0.49%) shares. Subsequently the holdings increased to 12,50,000 (post split/bonus) and he then transferred this entire holding to Envair Realty Pvt Ltd. (Noticee No. 54) through off-market route on January 12, 2009 (3,02,050 shares), January 13, 2009 (2,47,520 shares), January 21, 2009 (1,75,000 shares), January 21, 2009 (2,79,880 shares), January 22, 2009 (2,45,000 shares). It is gathered that Subashchandra Nigam and Chandrashekhar R Pandey, directors of Envair Realty Pvt Ltd, were earlier directors of JTREL. The shareholding of 0.49% shifted from one connected entity to another but the total number of shares under the camouflaged control of the Tayal group did not change and remained atAdjudication order in the matter of Jaybharat Textiles and Real Estate Ltd. & KSL and Industries Ltd.                               Page 11 of 181  28.24% since September 2006. Such camouflage has left shareholders in the dark since 2002 and investors have traded shares with misleading information on the company and the control of its promoters. iv. On comparing the RTA data with the data publicly disclosed on BSE website it is observed that in respect of five entities viz, Gopal Aggarwal, Milind Mhatre, Nandkishor Panchal, Rupesh Narvekar and Sandip Murkar, though they have been holding more than 1% of share capital of the company since 2003, their names were not shown on BSE website under that category. Therefore it appears that JTREL has deliberately withheld disclosures to the public thereby giving misleading information.  v. As per data of RTA, there are only 20 entities under the public category of \\\\\\\\u2018Individuals holding nominal share capital in excess of Rs. 1 lakh\\\\\\\\u2019 and their total shareholding remained unchanged at 1,44,14,869 shares constituting 28.24% of share capital. Yet, as on September 30, 2006, the company disclosed to the stock exchange 94,14,869 shares under this category that constituted only 18.44% of share capital and a holding of 9.8% was added under the category of \\\\\\\\u2018Individuals holding nominal share capital upto Rs. 1 lakh\\\\\\\\u2019, which displayed a holding of 12.33%. Even the smallest holding among these 19 persons was greater than 1 lakh shares. Therefore for a share of face value of Rs 5/- it is impossible and incorrect for any of these 20 entities to be shown in the retail investor category. It appears that the company desired to project (falsely) that retail category shareholders had acquired shares in the company for the first time, thereby indicating misleadingly emergence of investor interest. vi. Through entities evidently under the control of the promoter group, the promoters have control over an additional 28.24% of share capital of the company, which is falsely declared as public shareholding and not included in promoter category.  vii. The total public holding displayed on the website of BSE was 31.44% as on December 31, 2004, which increased to 32.95% as at quarter ended December 2009. This public holding excludes the promoter holding and represents the free-float shareholding in a company which is a critical factor that influences the price of the shares ",
