The Apparent Violations, which related to transactions involving\\\\\\\\nSudan or Syria that transited through the U.S. financial system, were processed between November 7,\\\\\\\\n2011 and August 28, 2014.  This settlement amount reflects OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s determination that NCB\\\\\\\\u2019s Apparent\\\\\\\\nViolations were non-egregious.\\\\\\\\nDescription of the Apparent Violations and the Conduct Leading to the Apparent Violations\\\\\\\\nBetween November 7, 2011 and August 28, 2014, NCB processed, directly or indirectly, 13 U.S. dollar\\\\\\\\n(USD) transactions totaling $5,918,560 to or through the United States in circumstances where a benefit\\\\\\\\nof NCB\\\\\\\\u2019s service was received by Sudanese or Syrian counterparties, or that involved goods originating\\\\\\\\nin or transiting through Sudan or Syria.  None of the Sudanese or Syrian parties was a customer of NCB.\\\\\\\\nThese transactions were in apparent violation of the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations (\\\\\\\\u201cSSR\\\\\\\\u201d), 31 C.F.R.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\xa7 538.205,1 and section 2(b) of Executive Order (E.O.) 13582 of August 17, 2011,2 respectively.  The\\\\\\\\nApparent Violations began in late 2011, after the bank had started to implement more robust compliance\\\\\\\\nmeasures intended to modernize and upgrade its compliance controls, including those relating to\\\\\\\\nsanctions screening and OFAC sanctions compliance.\\\\\\\\nPenalty Calculation and General Factors Analysis\\\\\\\\nThe statutory maximum civil monetary penalty applicable in this matter is $12,111,632.  OFAC\\\\\\\\ndetermined, however, that the Apparent Violations constitute a non-egregious case and that NCB\\\\\\\\nvoluntarily self-disclosed the eight Syria-related Apparent Violations, but did not voluntarily self-\\\\\\\\ndisclose the five Sudan-related Apparent Violations.  Accordingly, under OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s Economic Sanctions\\\\\\\\nEnforcement Guidelines (\\\\\\\\u201cEnforcement Guidelines\\\\\\\\u201d), the base civil monetary penalty amount applicable\\\\\\\\nin this matter is $1,814,854.  The settlement amount of $653,347 reflects OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s consideration of the\\\\\\\\nGeneral Factors under the Enforcement Guidelines.\\\\\\\\nOFAC determined the following to be aggravating factors:\\\\\\\\n(1) NCB conferred substantial economic benefit to U.S.-sanctioned parties and caused significant\\\\\\\\nharm to the integrity of U.S. sanctions programs and their associated policy objectives by\\\\\\\\n1 Effective October 12, 2017, pursuant to Executive Order 13761 (as amended by Executive Order 13804), U.S. persons are no\\\\\\\\nlonger prohibited from engaging in transactions that were previously prohibited solely under the SSR.  Consistent with the\\\\\\\\nrevocation of these sanctions, OFAC removed the SSR from the Code of Federal Regulations on June 29, 2018.  However, the\\\\\\\\nrevocation of these sanctions does not affect past, present, or future OFAC enforcement investigations or actions related to any\\\\\\\\napparent violations of the SSR arising from activities that occurred prior to October 12, 2017.\\\\\\\\n2 On May 2, 2014, OFAC amended the Syrian Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 542 (the \\\\\\\\u201cSySR\\\\\\\\u201d), and reissued them in\\\\\\\\ntheir entirety in order to implement various Executive orders, including Executive Order 13582 of August 17, 2011, \\\\\\\\u201cBlocking\\\\\\\\nProperty of the Government of Syria and Prohibiting Certain Transactions With Respect to Syria.\\\\\\\\u201d  See 79 Fed. Reg. 25,414\\\\\\\\n(May 2, 2014).  Prior to that date, the sanctions and related prohibitions established in Executive Order 13582 were not\\\\\\\\nimplemented in the SySR.2\\\\\\\\nallowing sanctioned parties to conduct business in or through the United States for a number\\\\\\\\nof years; and\\\\\\\\n(2) NCB is a large and commercially sophisticated financial institution.\\\\\\\\nOFAC determined the following to be mitigating factors:\\\\\\\\n(1) NCB did not act with willful intent to violate U.S. sanctions law or with a reckless disregard\\\\\\\\nfor its U.S. sanctions obligations;\\\\\\\\n(2) NCB has no prior sanctions history, including having not received a penalty notice or Finding\\\\\\\\nof Violation from OFAC in the five years preceding the date of the earliest transaction giving\\\\\\\\nrise to the apparent violations;\\\\\\\\n(3) NCB cooperated with OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s investigation into the Apparent Violations, including by\\\\\\\\nconducting an extensive transaction review and entering into a statute of limitations tolling\\\\\\\\nagreement with multiple extensions;\\\\\\\\n(4) Most of the Syria-related Apparent Violations occurred shortly after the imposition of relevant\\\\\\\\nprohibitions; and\\\\\\\\n(5) NCB enhanced compliance controls in response to past weaknesses and the subsequent\\\\\\\\nApparent Violations, including the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 Replaced its Board of Directors and senior executives and enhanced its compliance\\\\\\\\nprogram by implementing new sanctions screening software and new training procedures\\\\\\\\nfor bank personnel;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 Implemented internal policies that require payment and non-payment messages to be\\\\\\\\ntransparent, in line with Basel requirements and FATF recommendations, and that prohibit\\\\\\\\nthe omission, deletion or alteration of information in the payment messages or orders;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 Required screening of all payments against international sanctions lists, including OFAC\\\\\\\\nlists;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022\\\\\\\\nImplemented an Anti-Money Laundering Department that is tasked with sanctions\\\\\\\\ncompliance and countering illicit finance, including money laundering and terrorist\\\\\\\\nfinancing;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 Required prospective customer account openings to be subjected to substantial due\\\\\\\\ndiligence, including Compliance Department approval of any account opening, and\\\\\\\\nrestricted account openings to only residents of Saudi Arabia; and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022\\\\\\\\nProhibited the opening of USD accounts for any Sudanese customers or financial\\\\\\\\ninstitutions.3\\\\\\\\nCompliance Considerations\\\\\\\\nThis enforcement action highlights the importance of ensuring that sanctions compliance policies and\\\\\\\\nprocedures address both direct and indirect sanctions compliance risks, and in particular, highlights the\\\\\\\\nimportance of implementing strong remedial measures in response to sanctions program lapses.\\\\\\\\nOFAC Enforcement and Compliance Resources\\\\\\\\nFor more information regarding OFAC regulations, please visit: http://www.treasury.gov/ofac.\\\\\\\\nInformation concerning the civil penalties process is discussed in OFAC regulations governing the\\\\\\\\nvarious sanctions programs and in 31 C.F.R.

In the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd.   1. Pursuant to the investigation conducted in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018RKDL\\\\\\\\u2019) during the period from December 01, 2011 to December 31, 2012, Securities and Exchange Board of India (\"SEBI\") made the following observations:  1.1. Mr. R V Ravikumar (\\\\\\\\u201cNoticee No. 1\\\\\\\\u201d), Ravikumar Properties Pvt. Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cNoticee No. 2\\\\\\\\u201d), Mrs. R. Amrithavalli (\\\\\\\\u201cNoticee No. 3\\\\\\\\u201d), Mr. S Rajendran (\\\\\\\\u201cNoticee No. 4\\\\\\\\u201d), Mr. Siva Sankar V (\\\\\\\\u201cNoticee No. 5\\\\\\\\u201d) and Mrs. V Chitra (\\\\\\\\u201cNoticee No. 6\\\\\\\\u201d) were the promoters of RKDL during December 2011 to December 2012. Being promoters of RKDL, they were Persons Acting in Concert (\\\\\\\\u201cPACs\\\\\\\\u201d) in terms of definition of the expression in regulation 2(q)(2)(iv) of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011(hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SAST Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019) during the relevant times.    1.2. From the demat statement of Noticee No.1 as provided by CDSL, vide email dated March 21, 2018, it was observed that Noticee No. 1 had received 5,37,243 shares of RKDL on January 13, 2012 and 37,757 shares of RKDL on January 19, 2012 (totaling 5,75,000 shares) through off-market transactions. However, in the disclosures made by Noticee No. 1 to the stock exchanges on January 09, 2012, it was disclosed by him that he held 51,58,447 shares of RKDL as on that date. In view of the same, it has been alleged that the said disclosure made by Noticee No. 1 was incorrect as the total number of shares held by Noticee No. 1 was 53,75,000 (increase______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of six entities in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 2 of 14  of 2.40% in shareholding) and whereas the number of shares disclosed by him to the stock exchanges were only 51,58,447 shares. It was further observed that PACs were not included by Noticee No. 1 in the said disclosure. It is, therefore, alleged that by making such incorrect disclosures and not including PACs in the disclosure, Noticee No. 1 along with PACs i.e. Noticee No. 2 to 6 had violated Regulation 29(2) of the SAST Regulations. Details of shareholding of the aforesaid promoters in RKDL from quarter ended December 2011 to quarter ended March 2012 are tabulated as under: Table-1 S. No. Name As on Dec, 2011 As on Mar, 2012 No of shares % of shareholding No of shares % of shareholding 1 Noticee No. 1 48,00,000 20.00 53,75,000 22.40 2 Noticee No. 2 0 0.00 0 0.00 3 Noticee No. 3 75,056 0.31 1,45,497 0.60 4 Noticee No. 4 0 0.00 0 0.00 5 Noticee No. 5 180 0.00075 225 0.00094 6 Noticee No. 6 0 0.00 0 0.00  Total 48,75,236 20.31 55,20,722 23.00  1.3. As seen from the table above, shareholding of Noticee No.1 in RKDL increased by 2.40% by virtue of aforesaid acquisition of 5,75,000 shares in two tranches i.e. one on January 13, 2012 and another one on January 19, 2012. Thus, Noticee No.1 was required to make disclosure under the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018PIT Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019) in respect of the said acquisitions. However, from the reply of RKDL dated December 08, 2014 and reply of the BSE dated March 23, 2018, it was observed that no such disclosures were made by Noticee No. 1. In view of the same, it has been alleged that as the change in total shareholding of Noticee No. 1 exceeded 2% in RKDL and by not making the requisite disclosures in this regard as required under the PIT Regulations, Noticee No. 1 had violated Regulation 13(3) of PIT Regulations read with Regulation 12(2) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018PIT Regulations 2015\\\\\\\\u2019).   1.4. Noticee No. 1 along with the PACs i.e. Noticee No. 2 to 6 had pledged 78,75,000 shares and 45,49,719 with Comfort Intech Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cCIL\\\\\\\\u201d) on December 03, 2011 and December 19, 2011, respectively. In this regard, based on the exchange reply, it was observed that requisite disclosures under SAST Regulations have not been made to the stock exchange. Thus, in view of the same, it has been alleged that Noticee No. 1 along with PACs i.e. Noticee No. 2 to 6 have violated Regulation 29(2) and 31(1) of the SAST Regulations. Details of promoters\\\\\\\\u2019 shares pledged / released / invoked during the period from December 01, 2011 to December 27, 2011 are tabulated as under:______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of six entities in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd.

From the table above, it is observed that on December 19, 2011, 30,75,000 shares pledged by Noticee No. 2 were invoked by CIL. Further, on December 20, 2011, out of the 93,49,719 shares pledged by Noticee No. 1, 45,49,719 shares were invoked by CIL. Invocation of shares held by promoters along with PACs needs to be disclosed to stock exchange under Regulation 31(2) of the SAST Regulations. However, based on the exchange reply, it was observed that no such disclosures were made by the promoters in this regard. Thus, in view of the same, it has been alleged that Noticee No.1 and Noticee No. 2 along with PACs i.e. Noticee No. 3 to 6 have violated Regulation 31(2) of the SAST Regulations.   1.6. On December 27, 2011, 48,00,000 shares pledged by Noticee No. 1 (i.e.93,49,719 shares-45,49,719 shares) were released.  In this regard, it was observed that disclosure on release of shares pledged was made to the Exchanges by Noticee No. 1 vide his letter dated December 27, 2011. However, the said disclosure was not made in the format as specified under SAST Regulations. Therefore, it has been alleged that Noticee No. 1 along with PACs i.e. Noticee No. 2 to 6 have violated Regulation 29(2) and 31(2) of the SAST Regulations.   1.7. Vide Summons dated October 22, 2014 to RKDL, all disclosures received by RKDL under SAST Regulations and PIT Regulations were sought by SEBI. Based on the reply of RKDL dated July 4, 2014 and December 08, 2014, it was observed that no disclosures under PIT Regulations were made by Noticee No. 2 and Noticee No. 1 with respect to invocation of their respective shares pledged on December 19, 2011 and December 20, 2011 which resulted into change in their shareholding exceeding 2% of total shareholding in RKDL. Therefore, in view of the same, it has been alleged that Noticee No. 2 and Noticee No. 1 had violated regulation 13(3) of the PIT Regulations read with Regulation 12(2) of PIT Regulations, 2015.   2. Therefore, in view of the above, it has been alleged that the Noticees have violated the following provisions of SAST Regulations and PIT Regulations:______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of six entities in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 4 of 14   (i) Regulation 29 (2), 31 (1) and 31 (2) of the SAST Regulations.  (ii) Regulation 13(3) of the PIT Regulations read with Regulation 12(2) of PIT Regulations, 2015.  3. The text of the aforementioned provisions is reproduced as under: SAST Regulations Disclosure of acquisition and disposal. 29. (1) \\\\\\\\u2026.

Pursuant to submission of the investigation report, the competent authority in SEBI prima facie felt satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to inquire and adjudicate upon the aforesaid violations by the Noticees. By a communication-order dated July 18, 2019 Shri Santosh Shukla was appointed as Adjudicating Officer to inquire into and adjudge under Rule 5 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018the Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) and under Section 15A (b) and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) for the aforesaid alleged violations by the Noticees. Subsequent to the transfer of Shri Santsoh Shukla vide communication order dated January 07, 2020 the case has been transferred to undersigned. It has been advised that except for the change of the Adjudicating Officer, the other terms and condition of the original orders (whereby the aforesaid Adjudicating Officers was appointed) \\\\\\\\u2018shall remain unchanged and shall be in full force and effect\\\\\\\\u2019. It has also been advised that \\\\\\\\u2018I should proceed in accordance with the terms of reference made in the original orders.\\\\\\\\u2019. The said provisions of the SEBI Act applicable during the period of violation read as under:   Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc.      15A. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder,-______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of six entities in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd.

(b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less; Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided. 15HB. Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which may extend to one crore rupees. 5. Accordingly, after receipt of records of the proceedings, a notice to show cause no. EAD/AP-SKS/OW/4244/1-4 and 6-7/2020 dated January 30, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018the SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticees calling upon them to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against them in terms of rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules and penalty be not imposed under Section 15A (b) and 15HB of the SEBI Act for the aforesaid alleged violations. The SCN sent to Noticee No.1 to 5 was served at their last known address. However, SCN sent to Noticee No. 6 returned undelivered.   6. In response to the SCN, Noticee No. 1 to 5 filed a common reply vide letter dated February 27, 2020, and availed the opportunity of hearing granted to them on August 24, 2020, through the Webex platform, when Mr. M. Padmanabhan, Chartered Accountant, Authorized Representative (\\\\\\\\u2018AR\\\\\\\\u2019) of Noticee No. 1 to 5 appeared on their behalf. The AR made oral submissions on the lines of written reply dated February 27, 2020 and explained the contents thereof. The AR while acknowledging the record of proceedings of the hearing held on August 24, 2020, also submitted that explanations made by him on behalf of Noticee No. 1 to 5 may also be considered as the explanations of Ms V Chitra (Noticee No.6) as she has only been a shareholder in RKDL as a nominee of the main Promoter, Mr. R.V.Ravikumar (Noticee No.1), as disclosed in the Red Herring Prospectus (\\\\\\\\u2018RHP\\\\\\\\u2019). Subsequently, the AR also filed post-hearing written submissions on behalf of Noticee No. 1 to 6 vide letter dated August 28, 2020. The replies/submissions of the Noticees are inter-alia as follows:  a) The Promoters have no information about the present whereabouts of Ms. V. Chitra (Noticee No.6) who was a Director of the Company at the time of its formation but subsequently vacated office as Director prior to the Public Issue.  b) The basis of the alleged violations by the Noticees is the so-called pledge of securities, their invocation and their subsequent release. The entire story of pledge of securities, their invocation etc. is a fabricated one and carried out by Mr. Anil Agrawal of the Comfort group who was the BRLM to the Public issue and his associates.______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of six entities in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 7 of 14  c) The above so-called pledge etc. were carried out fraudulently by Mr. Anil Agarwal by misrepresentation, forgery and deceit. He obtained blank signed papers as well as blank signed cheque leaves from Mr. R.V Ravikumar (Noticee No. 1) during the course of the public issue and it had been misused by him to perpetrate the above fraud. This has been proved to the satisfaction of SEBI and is clearly borne out by the Orders of the Hon'ble Whole Time Member of SEBI vide Order No. WTM/GM/EFD/99/2018-19 dated March 12, 2019. Further, Mr.Sarthak Vijilani who was an employee of Mr.Anil Agrawal during the period of the Public issue and who had undertaken the due diligence in regard to the public issue, has deposed before the Hon'ble Whole Time Member that he was witness to Noticee No. 1 handing over the blank papers and cheques to Mr.Anil Agrawal as demanded by the latter. This fact is brought out in the orders of the Hon'ble Whole Time Member Ref. No. WTM/GM/EFD/71/2019-20 dated February 14, 2020.  d) The violation alleged in Para 1.2 of the SCN is that the Noticee No.1 filed incorrect particulars of his shareholding in the format of disclosure. This format would be applicable only in relation to Substantial Acquisitions and Takeovers. In this case, in view of the facts pointed out above, the return itself is redundant as the so-called pledge, invoking and release are illegal, fraudulent and hence non-est. Hence the error pointed out may be considered as only a clerical mistake and it is submitted that no penalty be levied on the above Noticees.  e) As regards the Alleged Violation contained in Para 1.3 of the SCN, it is submitted that there has been no acquisition of 5.75 lakhs shares by Noticee No. 1. It is only a partial return of the shares illegally and fraudulently taken away from Noticee No. 1 by Mr.Anil Agrawal and his associates in the manner explained herein above. As such the question of making disclosure under PIT Regulations would not arise.   f) As regards alleged violation mentioned in Para 1.4 of the SCN regarding pledge of 78,75,000 shares and 45,49,719 shares with CIL on December 03, 2011 and December 19, 2011 respectively, it is submitted that there has never been any pledge of the above mentioned shares as explained earlier in this letter. The so-called pledge is only a fake transaction and hence obligation on the part of the above Noticees to make requisite disclosures under SAST Regulations would not arise.  g) The alleged violation in Para 1.5 of the SCN is with regard to invoking of shares by CIL and non-disclosure thereof by the above Noticees. In this regard, it is submitted that since the pledge itself is non-existent, invoking thereof could never happen and hence there would be no obligation on the Noticees to make disclosures under Regulations 31(2) of the SAST Regulations.______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of six entities in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 8 of 14   h) As regards the alleged violation contained in Para 1.6 of the SCN, it is submitted that these 48 lakhs shares were also only a partial return of the shares fraudulently taken over by Mr. Anil Agarwal from Noticee No. 1 and the pledge itself was fake. As such there was no obligation to make any disclosure of release of these shares as the shares lawfully belong to Noticee No. 1. Further, the alleged violation is that disclosure has not been made in the specified format.  It may kindly be noted from Annexure 5 of the SCN that what is contained therein is not a disclosure to the Exchange but a clarification by RKDL to BSE by way of all disclosure to Public and all shareholders through BSE. This can be seen from the subject specified in the said letter of RKDL. Hence the alleged violation of making disclosure in improper format would not arise. As regards the alleged violation contained in Para 1.7 of the SCN, it is submitted that the reply to the alleged violation in Para 1.5 would hold good here also.  i) In view of the above, it is submitted that the Noticees could not be found fault with for any of the violations alleged against them and, in the interest of natural justice, they may not be subjected to any penal action.  j) Further, RKDL has been refunded the Security Deposit of 1 % of the IPO amount by BSE during 2015 after due process including approval of SEBI as there were no Investor Grievances or Complaints.  7. I have carefully considered the allegations levelled in the terms of reference, the reply/submissions of the Noticees and the relevant material available on record. It is an admitted position that the Noticees were the promoters of RKDL during December 2011 to December 2012. Being promoters of RKDL, they were PACs in terms of definition of the expression in regulation 2(q)(2)(iv) of the SAST Regulations during the relevant times. The basic contention of the Noticees is that so-called pledge transactions were carried out fraudulently by Mr. Anil Agarwal by misrepresentation, forgery and deceit as he obtained blank signed papers as well as blank signed cheque leaves from Noticee No. 1 during the course of the public issue and it had been misused by him to perpetrate the above fraud. In this context, the Noticees also placed reliance on the Orders of the Hon'ble Whole Time Member of SEBI bearing reference nos. WTM/GM/EFD/99/2018-19 dated March 12, 2019 and WTM/GM/EFD/71/2019-20 dated February 14, 2020.   8. From the perusal of the aforesaid Orders of the Hon'ble Whole Time Member of SEBI, it is inferred that the overall premise of the said two orders are with respect to determining whether RKDL and its promoters/ directors were involved in siphoning of Rs.33.83 crore from RKDL\\\\\\\\u2019s IPO corpus. It is noted that although RKDL and its directors were given the benefit of intention and held that the consequence of siphoning off was without their knowledge and intention, it was______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of six entities in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 9 of 14  held that Noticee No. 1 Mr. R.V Ravikumar and his relatives and other directors of RKDL have acted recklessly while engaging CSL as its BRLM and by entering directly into financial dealings with CIL. As regards the contention of the Noticees that pledge was carried out fraudulently by Mr. Anil Agarwal by misrepresentation, forgery and deceit as he obtained blank signed papers as well as blank signed cheque leaves from Noticee No. 1 during the course of the public issue and it had been misused by him to perpetrate the above fraud, a passing remark has been made in the order dated March 12, 2019, that RKDL and CSL are battling legal disputes between them on various issues that arose in connection with its engagement of CSL as the Merchant Banker to its IPO, such as, misuse of signed blank cheques, forgery of signatures on DIS slips and other documents and the unauthorized creation of a pledge of shares of RKDL by Anil Agarwal in his favour etc. and that RKDL had submitted that a number of cases, both civil and criminal, are pending before various forums and courts in this regard. Thus, the issue of pledge carried out fraudulently by Mr. Anil Agarwal as claimed by the Noticees is left open for determination and not dealt in the said order. Further, there is no material before me to substantiate that the pledge transactions were carried out fraudulently. I am, therefore, of the view that reliance placed by the Noticees on the orders of the Hon'ble Whole Time Member of SEBI do not serve the desired purpose as far as these proceedings are concerned. I will, therefore, deal with this matter as per the material available before me for deciding the merits of the case.  9. At the outset, I note that the major issue is of disclosure of certain pledge transactions with one CIL. I also note from the submissions of the Noticees that these pledge transactions were disputed and the Noticees took recourse to Economic Offences wing, Mumbai, Enforcement Directorate, Mumbai, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court, Hyderabad, police Department, Hyderabad, Second Additional District Judge, RR District, Hyderabad and Company Law Board, Chennai and outcome of that recourse is not on record. Now coming to the merits of the case, the first allegation is that by making incorrect disclosures and not including PACs in the disclosure dated January 09, 2012, Noticee No. 1 along with PACs i.e. Noticee No. 2 to 6 had violated Regulation 29(2) of the SAST Regulations as the total number of shares held by Noticee No. 1 was 53,75,000 (increase of 2.40% in shareholding) and whereas the number of shares disclosed by him to the stock exchanges were 51,58,447 shares. In this regard, the Noticees submitted that this format would be applicable only in relation to Substantial Acquisitions and Takeovers. From the said disclosure dated January 09, 2012, it is noted that before the acquisition of 5,75,000 shares, Noticee No. 1 held 51,58,447 shares and post-acquisition he held 57,33,447 shares. However, from the demat statement of Noticee No.1 as provided by CDSL, it is noted that before the acquisition of 5,75,000 shares, Noticee No. 1 held 48,00,000 shares and post-acquisition he held 53,75,000 shares. Although, number of shares acquired was disclosed correctly, the holding of shares before acquisition was not disclosed appropriately i.e. 48,00,000 shares vis-\\\\\\\\xe0-vis 51,58,447 shares. In their submissions, the Noticees______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of six entities in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 10 of 14  admitted the allegation by mentioning that the error pointed out may be considered as only a clerical mistake. Thus, there is information asymmetry on account of clerical mistake on the part of the Noticees and resultantly, the charge to this extent i.e. on making incorrect disclosure stands established. Having said the same, it is pertinent to note that the language of Regulation 29(2) of the SAST Regulations mentions that any person, who together with persons acting in concert with him, holds shares entitling them to five per cent or more of the shares or voting rights in a target company, shall disclose the number of shares or voting rights held and such change in shareholding or voting rights exceeds two per cent of total shareholding or voting rights in the target company, in such form as may be specified. In the instant case, it is an admitted position that the Noticee No. 1 had made disclosure in the form as specified under Regulation 29(2) of the SAST Regulations and the conditions as prescribed under Regulation 29(2) remains satisfied. In my view, the default on account of clerical mistake is venial and not blameworthy to impose penalty.  10. The second allegation is that on account of the aforementioned acquisition of 5,75,000 shares, change in total shareholding of Noticee No. 1 exceeded 2% i.e. 2.40% in RKDL as on January 19, 2012, and failed to make requisite disclosures in this regard, as required under Regulation 13(3) of the PIT Regulations read with Regulation 12(2) of PIT Regulations, 2015. In this regard, the Noticees contended that there has been no acquisition of 5,75,000 shares by Noticee No. 1 and that it is only a partial return of the shares illegally and fraudulently taken away from Noticee No. 1 by Mr.Anil Agrawal and his associates and as such the question of making disclosure under PIT Regulations would not arise. From the submissions of the Noticees, I note that on one hand, the Noticee No. 1 had made disclosure with regard to said acquisition of 5,75,000 shares under SAST Regulations and had not disputed the said acquisition. On the other hand, the Noticees contend that there has been no acquisition of 5,75,000 shares by Noticee No. 1 and that it is only a partial return of the shares illegally and fraudulently taken away from Noticee No. 1 by Mr.Anil Agrawal. These statements made by the Noticees for the same transaction is in sharp contradiction to each other. I also note that BSE vide email dated March 23, 2018 had confirmed that no such disclosures were made by Noticee No. 1 in this regard under the PIT Regulations. Thus, the charge that Noticee No. 1 had failed to make requisite disclosures in this regard as required under Regulation 13(3) of the PIT Regulations read with Regulation 12(2) of PIT Regulations, 2015 stands established and deserves imposition of monetary penalty.  11. The third allegation is that Noticee No. 1 along with the PACs i.e. Noticee No. 2 to 6 had pledged 78,75,000 shares and 45,49,719 shares with CIL on December 03, 2011 and December 19, 2011, respectively and requisite disclosures under SAST Regulations were not made leading to violation of Regulation 29(2) and 31(1) of the SAST Regulations. In this regard, the Noticees submitted that so-called pledge is only a fake transaction and hence obligation on their part to make requisite disclosures under SAST Regulations would not arise. From the BSE website, I note that CIL had______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of six entities in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 11 of 14  provided details of 1,24,24,719 shares (78,75,000 shares + 45,49,719 shares) pledged to them by the target company i.e. RKDL in respect of its transactions dated December 03, 2011 and December 19, 2011, as required under Regulation 29(1) of the SAST Regulations. In this regard, on December 21, 2011, RKDL had posted an update on the BSE website titled \\\\\\\\u201cIllegal Pledge created by Comfort Intech Ltd\\\\\\\\u201d. From the said update, it is noted that RKDL vide its letter dated December 15, 2011, had informed the public at large that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026the Promoters and the company are aware that the locked in shares cannot be pledged otherwise as stated in the Regulations. We and our promoters confirm that no shares have been pledged and Comfort Intech Ltd. in connivance with Comfort Securities Ltd. and their Chairman Mr. Anil Aggarwal had purportedly fabricated documents and misused the properties of the company and the promoters and have treated the shares as pledged in gross violation of the SEBI Regulations and other laws.\\\\\\\\u201d These rebuttals from the company demonstrate that there is enough material to show that the pledge transactions in question were vehemently denied by RKDL. I also observe that the so-called disputed pledge has been undone by CIL by releasing 48,00,000 shares pledged by Notic", "Date": "2020-12-28", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Adjudication Order in respect of six entities in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd.", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/dec-2020/adjudication-order-in-respect-of-six-entities-in-the-matter-of-ravi-kumar-distilleries-ltd-_48587.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 58298, "unique_record_id": "20b135bde2SEBI20201228", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6680af287858910306471834", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 01:04:07", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Disclosure Failings", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "one lakh rupees", "gpt_audience": "1.

A-301, 3rd Floor, Hetal Arch,  Opp. Natraj Market, S V Road, Malad (W),  Mumbai \\\\\\\\u2013 400064.  In the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd.   1. Pursuant to the investigation conducted in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018RKDL\\\\\\\\u2019) during the period from December 01, 2011 to December 31, 2012, Securities and Exchange Board of India (\"SEBI\") made the following observations:  1.1. On December 15, 2011, Comfort Intech Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cCIL\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) had provided details of 1,24,24,719 shares pledged to them to the target company i.e. RKDL in respect of its transaction dated December 03, 2011 as required under Regulation 29(2) of the SAST Regulations. In this regard, it was observed that the said disclosures were made by CIL to RKDL with a delay of 6 working days i.e. from December 07, 2011 to December 15, 2011. In view of the same, it has been alleged that CIL by making the disclosure to RKDL with a delay of 6 working days has violated the provisions of Regulation 29(2) and 29(3)(b) of the SAST Regulations. Details of disclosures with respect to pledge as required to be made by CIL under SAST Regulations are as under: Table-1 Date Mode Pre-acquisition shareholding Pledge acceptance/ Release of pledgee/ Sold Post-acquisition shareholding Cumulative Change in holding Date of disclosure to company Date of disclosure to stock exchange Violation of Regulation(s) under  SAST No. of shares % of share capital No. of shares % of share capital Value (Rs) No. of shares % of share capital No. of shares % of share capital December 3,2011 Pledge Accept 2366000 9.86% 7875000 32.81 -- 10241000 42.67 7875000 32.81 December 15,2011 December 7,2011  29(2) and 29(3)(b) December 19,2011 Pledge Accept 10241000 42.67 4549719 18.96 -- 14790719 61.63 12424719 51.77 December 15,2011 December 7,2011 December 19,2011 Sell on Market 14790719 61.63 4806000 20.03 5,00,20,288 9984719 41.60 761879 31.74 January 2,2012 December 21,2011 29(2) and 29(3)(b)______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Comfort Intech Ltd. in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd.

From the demat statements of CIL, it was observed that CIL accepted pledge of 78,75,000 shares and 45,49,719 shares on December 03, 2011 and December 19, 2011, respectively. Thus, cumulatively CIL accepted pledge of 1,24,24,719 shares and the said quantity of shares corresponds to the disclosures made by CIL to BSE on December 05, 2011. However, from the demat statements of CIL it was seen that only 78,75,000 shares were pledged with CIL as on December 03, 2011. In this regard, it was observed that the disclosure made by CIL to RKDL and BSE that as on December 5, 2011, 1,24,24,719 shares were pledged with it was incorrect. Thus, in view of the same, it has been alleged that by making such incorrect disclosure, CIL had violated the provisions of Regulation 29(2) of the SAST Regulations.  1.3. On December 27, 2011, 48,00,000 shares pledged with CIL were released. Based on BSE email dated January 30, 2018 and NSE email dated February 06, 2018, it was observed that CIL has not made the requisite disclosures in respect of the said transaction. In view of the same, it has been alleged that CIL by not making the requisite disclosures has violated Regulation 29(2) of the SAST Regulations.  1.4. On December 19, 2011 and December 20, 2011, CIL sold 48,06,000 shares (20.03% of total shareholding) and 28,18,719 shares (11.74% of total shareholding), respectively. In respect of the said sale transactions, CIL made disclosure to RKDL on January 02, 2012. In this regard, it was observed that there was a delay of 8 working days in the disclosure made by CIL to RKDL i.e. from December 21, 2011 to January 02, 2012. In view of the same, it has been alleged that by making the disclosure to RKDL with a delay of 8 working days, CIL has violated the provisions of Regulation 29(2) and 29(3)(b) of the SAST Regulations.  1.5. On December 19, 2011, CIL made a net sale transaction of 17,31,000 shares and resultantly, its shareholding changed from 9.86% to 2.65%. On December 20, 2011, CIL had a net pledge invocation of 17,31,000 shares and resultantly, its shareholding in RKDL increased from 2.65% to 9.86%. In respect of the said two transactions, CIL ought to have disclosed the change in its shareholding to RKDL under Regulation 13(3) of the PIT Regulations and Regulation 13 (1) of the PIT Regulations, respectively. In this regard, vide Summons dated October 22, 2014, SEBI sought disclosures received by RKDL. Based on the reply of RKDL dated December 08,______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Comfort Intech Ltd. in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 3 of 14  2014, it was observed that no disclosures under PIT Regulations were received by RKDL from CIL. Further, details of all the disclosures made by CIL were sought from BSE and NSE. Based on BSE email dated January 30, 2018 and NSE email dated February 06, 2018, it was observed that CIL has not made the requisite disclosures under PIT Regulations to both BSE and NSE. Therefore, in view of the same, it has been alleged that CIL has violated regulation 13(3) and 13(1) of the PIT Regulations read with Regulation 12(2) of PIT Regulations, 2015. Details of disclosures as required to be made by CIL under PIT Regulations are tabulated as under: Table-2 Date Mode Pre-acquisition shareholding Pledge Invocation/ Sale Post-acquisition shareholding Change in Holding Date of disclosure to company Disclosure by Company to stock exchange Violation of Regulation(s) under  PIT No. of shares % of share capital No. of shares % of share capital No. of shares % of share capital No. of shares % of share capital 19/12/2011 Net Sell (Pledge invocation and sell on same day) 23,66,000 9.86% 17,31,000 ( net of sell on market of 48,06,000 shares and invocation of 30,75,000 shares on same day) 7.21% 6,35,000 2.65% 17,31,000 7.21% No disclosure No disclosure 13(3) 20/12/2011 Net pledge invocation (Pledge invocation and sell on same day) 6,35,000 2.65% 17,31,000 (net of sell on market of 28,18,719 shares and invocation of 45,49,719 shares on same day) 7.21% 23,66,000 9.86% 17,31,000 7.21% No disclosure No disclosure 13(1)  2. Therefore, in view of the above, it has been alleged that the Noticee has violated the following provisions of SAST Regulations and PIT Regulations:  (i) Regulation 29(2) and 29(3)(b) of the SAST Regulations.  (ii) Regulation 13(1) and 13(3) of the PIT Regulations read with Regulation 12(2) of PIT Regulations, 2015.  3.

Pursuant to submission of the investigation report, the competent authority in SEBI prima facie felt satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to inquire and adjudicate upon the aforesaid violations by the Noticee. By a communication-order dated July 18, 2019 Shri Santosh Shukla was appointed as Adjudicating Officer to inquire into and adjudge under Rule 5 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018the Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) and under Section 15A (b) and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) for the aforesaid alleged violations by the Noticee. Subsequent to the transfer of Shri Santsoh Shukla vide communication order dated January 07, 2020 the case has been transferred to undersigned. It has been advised that except for the change of the Adjudicating Officer, the other terms and condition of the original orders (whereby the aforesaid Adjudicating Officers was appointed) \\\\\\\\u2018shall remain unchanged and shall be in full force and effect\\\\\\\\u2019. It has also been advised that \\\\\\\\u2018I should proceed in accordance with the terms of reference made in the original orders.\\\\\\\\u2019. The said provisions of the SEBI Act applicable during the period of violation read as under:   Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc.      15A. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder,- (a) \\\\\\\\u2026.. (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less; Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided. 15HB. Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which may extend to one crore rupees. 5. Accordingly, after receipt of records of the proceedings, a notice to show cause no. EAD/AP-SKS/OW/4244/9/2020 dated January 30, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018the SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee calling upon it to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against it in terms of rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules and penalty be not imposed under Section 15A (b) and 15HB of the SEBI Act for the aforesaid alleged violations. The SCN sent to Noticee was served at its last known address.______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Comfort Intech Ltd. in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 6 of 14    6. In response to the SCN, vide letter dated February 26, 2020, the Noticee filed its preliminary reply seeking additional 15 days\\\\\\\\u2019 time to submit its detailed reply and also sought an opportunity of personal hearing. However, it is observed that no reply has been submitted by the Noticee thereafter. In the interest of principles of natural justice and after considering the material available on record, the undersigned granted an opportunity of personal hearing on September 16, 2020. The Noticee, after seeking extension of time, availed the opportunity of hearing granted to it on October 09, 2020, through the Webex platform, when Mr. Shourya Tanay, Advocate, Authorized Representative (\\\\\\\\u2018AR\\\\\\\\u2019) of the Noticee appeared on its behalf. The AR made oral submissions with regard to the each of the allegations raised against the Noticee in the SCN and as the Noticee has not filed any reply to the SCN, the AR requested one-week additional time to file a detailed reply. The request of the Noticee was acceded to. Thereafter, the Noticee filed its replies vide letters dated October 16, 2020 and October 28, 2020. The replies/submissions of the Noticee are inter-alia as follows:  a) The transactions on the basis of which allegations have been made against it were executed in the period of 2011 - 2012, i.e almost 9 years back and the SCN has been issued to it in the month of January, 2020. There is an inordinate delay in the initiation of the proceedings and   on this ground alone the proceedings may be dropped. In this regard, the Noticee placed reliance on the following judgements of Hon'ble Supreme Court and Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (\\\\\\\\u2018SAT\\\\\\\\u2019): (i) Adjudicating Officer, Securities and Exchange Board of India Vs. Bhavesh Pabari (Civil Appeal No. 11311 of 2013) decision dated February 28, 2019. (ii) ICICI Bank Limited Vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 583 of 2019) decision dated July 08, 2020. (iii) Bharat J Patel Vs SEBI (Appeal No. 154 of 2020) decision dated September 08, 2020.  b) The violation alleged in Para 1.1 of the SCN is that the Noticee had made disclosures to RKDL with a delay of 6 working days. It submitted that it had duly informed the respective Stock Exchanges i.e. BSE and NSE about the transactions within the stipulated time vide its letter dated December 05, 2011. In support of its claim, it provided acknowledgement copies of the same.  c) At the time the acceptance of the pledge of the said shares, one of the representative of RKDL was present in its office and it had handed over the disclosures to him. However, due to afflux of time, it is not able to retrieve the acknowledgement. Subsequently, as a matter of abundant caution, it had sent the disclosures via courier to the registered office of RKDL. Therefore, the alleged delay was due to the practical aspects involved and the same was inconsequential as it had already submitted information to the representative of RKDL.______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Comfort Intech Ltd. in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 7 of 14   d)  Pursuant to its intimation to the stock exchange, the same was duly displayed on their website and the said information regarding pledge was available in public domain. Admittedly, it has also been stated in the SCN that the said disclosures were filed with the Stock Exchanges on December 07, 2011, and therefore were already in the public domain. This clearly establishes that it did not have any mala-fide intention behind the alleged delayed disclosure of the transaction to RKDL and no loss or harm was caused to the investors and no gain or unfair advantage has occurred to it. Therefore, the disclosure when filed with the stock exchange, even when not filed with the company should be treated with leniency and it ought not be penalized.  e) The violation alleged in Para 1.2 of the SCN is that the disclosure made by the Noticee to RKDL and BSE that as on December 5, 2011, 1,24,24,719 shares were pledged with it was incorrect as its demat statements of CIL shows that only 78,75,000 shares were pledged with it as on December 03, 2011. It submitted that disclosure for 1,24,24,719shares was made by it with bona fide intention and it was decided to accept the pledge for a total of 1,24,24,719 shares and not only 78,75,000 shares as observed.  f) The pledge of 78,75,000 shares and 45,49,719 shares was accepted on December 03, 2011 and December 19, 2011 respectively as per the terms of agreement. The pledge of shares was accepted in two tranches, however, the disclosure of all 1,24,24,719 shares was made on December 05, 2011 itself since it was already decided that the pledge of remaining shares would also be accepted at a subsequent date. The alleged delay in execution of the second tranche of the pledge was only as per agreement and was not done with any mala-fide intention on its part. The mere fact that the pledge actually took place just after a minor delay of a few days ought not to form a ground for levying penalty on it.  g) The violation alleged in Para 1.3 of the SCN is that on December 27, 2011, 48,00,000 shares pledged with it were released and it had not made appropriate disclosures regarding the same. It submitted that RKDL had vide its letter dated December 27, 2011 had intimated to BSE and NSE that the issues regarding the loan had been settled between it and RKDL. As a result of the mutual settlement, the said release of 48,00,000 shares by it had taken place.  Therefore, the allegation that it had not made disclosures regarding the said release of shares holds no ground as RKDL has duly vide its letter dated December 27, 2011, informed about the release. As the information was intimated to both the stock exchanges, the same was already in public domain and thereby no damage or harm could be said to be caused to the investors or the market as a whole.______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Comfort Intech Ltd. in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 8 of 14  h) The violation alleged in Para 1.4 of the SCN is that the Noticee had made disclosures to RKDL with a delay of 8 working days in respect of sale of 48,06,000 shares and 28,18,719 shares on December 19, 2011 and December 20, 2011, respectively. It submitted that it had duly informed the respective Stock Exchange i.e. BSE vide its letter dated December 21, 2011. Admittedly, it has been stated in the SCN itself that the said disclosures were filed with the Stock Exchanges on December 21, 2011, and therefore were already in the public domain. This clearly establishes that it did not have any mala-fide intention behind the alleged delayed disclosure of the transaction to RKDL and no loss or harm was caused to the investors and no gain or unfair advantage has occurred to it. Therefore, the disclosure when filed with the stock exchange, even when not filed with the company should be treated with leniency and it ought not be penalized.  i) RKDL had filed the disclosure dated 27.12.2011 to the Stock Exchange that they had   mutually settled all issues with the Noticee, it implies that information of sale of the aforesaid shares was given to them well within time, without which such a disclosure could not have been made by them on 27.12.2011. As such, there has been no delay.  j) The violation alleged in Para 1.5 of the SCN is that on December 19, 2011, it made a net sale transaction of 17,31,000 shares and resultantly, its shareholding changed from 9.86% to 2.65% and that on December 20, 2011, it had a net pledge invocation of 17,31,000 shares and resultantly, its shareholding changed from 2.65% to 9.86%. However, it had not made the requisite disclosures regarding the said transactions under PIT Regulations to RKDL and both BSE and NSE. Hence, it has been alleged that it had violated Regulation 13(3) and 13(1) of the PIT Regulations read with Regulation 12(2) of the PIT Regulations, 2015. It submitted that as per   SEBI Circular no. SEBI/MRD/SE/Cir-7/2004, dated January 14, 2004, regarding disclosures of trade details of bulk deals, the net sale of 17,31,000 shares by us falls under the definition of bulk deals.   k) In terms of paragraph 1.1 of the said circular, a \"bulk deal\" constitutes of \"all transactions in a scrip (on an exchange) where total quantity of shares bought/sold is more than 0.5% of the number of equity shares of the company listed on the exchange\". Thus, the quantitative limit of 0.5% could be reached through one or more transactions executed during the day in the normal market segment. Its net sale of 17,31,000 shares falls under the definition of \"Bulk deals\". In view of the aforesaid circulars, the brokers are required to disseminate such information to the Stock Exchanges which is displayed on the website of the stock exchange. Therefore, keeping in mind the directions of the circular, it is submitted that it can be reasonably assumed that the information regarding its sale transaction of the 17,31,000 shares was already given to the stock exchanges______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Comfort Intech Ltd. in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 9 of 14  by its broker and the same was made public by the stock exchange. Therefore, there had been no non-disclosure on its part and it deny everything contrary thereto.  l) With regard to the invocation of pledge of 17,31,000 shares, it submitted that without   prejudice to the aforesaid, the alleged non-disclosure was technical in nature and due to inadvertence devoid of any mala-fide intention. Further, no harm has been caused to any investor nor any loss has occurred due to our non-disclosure. It did not have any intention to conceal the information from investors at large and neither did it had any unfair gain or advantage nor was any loss or harm caused to the investors with non-disclosure of the said information.   m) The provisions of Regulation 29(2) and 29(3)(b) SAST Regulations, 2011 and Regulation 13(1) and 13(3) of the PIT Regulations are not substantially different, since violation of first automatically triggers violation of second and hence a lenient view may be taken as regards imposition of penalty and penalty may not be imposed. The 29(2) and 29(3)(b) SAST Regulations and Regulation 13(1) and 13(3) of the PIT Regulations are not stand alone regulations and one is corollary of other. In this regard, it placed reliance on the judgement of Hon'ble SAT in the case of Vitro Commodities Private Limited Vs SEBI decided on 4.9.2013.  n) As per SCN, the penalty is proposed to be levied under two Sections of Chapter VIA of SEBI Act, 1992 viz. Section 15 A(b) and 15 HB for the same set of violations which is against the principles enshrined in Constitution of India wherein it has been stipulated under Article 20(2) that \"No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once\". \".  The penalty for non-disclosure under any Regulation has been specified under Section 15 A(b) of SEBI Act and hence, the invocation of Section 15HB for levy of penalty defies logic.  o) It further placed reliance on the following judgements of Hon'ble Courts/ Hon'ble SAT/   Ld.  WTM   / Ld. Adjudicating Officers of SEBI which concluded that if the breach is merely technical and unintentional, penalty may not be levied: (i) Order of Ld. WTM dated February 02, 2017 in the case of Refex Industries Limited (formerly known as Refex Refrigerants Limited) (ii) Order of Ld. Adjudicating Officer dated May 11, 2017 in the case of Jindal Cotex Limited. (iii) Reliance Industries Ltd. v SEBI (SAT Appeal No. 39/2002). (iv) Order of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Akbar BadrudinBadrudin]iwani  V.  Collector   of Customs, Bombay (AIR 1990 SC 1579). (v) Order of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Hindustan Steel Ltd., v State of Orissa, (1970) 1 SCR  753; (AIR 1970 SC2563)______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Comfort Intech Ltd. in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 10 of 14  7. I have carefully considered the allegations levelled in the terms of reference, the reply/submissions of the Noticee and the relevant material available on record. The first allegation is that on December 15, 2011, the Noticee had provided details of 1,24,24,719 shares pledged to them to the target company i.e. RKDL in respect of its transaction dated December 03, 2011 as required under Regulation 29(2) of the SAST Regulations. However, the said disclosures were made by it to RKDL with a delay of 6 working days i.e. from December 07, 2011 to December 15, 2011, leading to violation of the provisions of Regulation 29(2) and 29(3)(b) of the SAST Regulations. The second allegation is that CIL accepted pledge of 78,75,000 shares and 45,49,719 shares on December 03, 2011 and December 19, 2011, respectively. Thus, cumulatively CIL accepted pledge of 1,24,24,719 shares and the said quantity of shares corresponds to the disclosures made by CIL to BSE on December 05, 2011. However, from the demat statements of CIL it was seen that only 78,75,000 shares were pledged with CIL as on December 03, 2011. Hence, the disclosure made by CIL to RKDL and BSE that as on December 5, 2011, 1,24,24,719 shares were pledged with it was incorrect leading to violation of the provisions of Regulation 29(2) of the SAST Regulations. The third allegation is that on December 27, 2011, 48,00,000 shares pledged with CIL were released. However, CIL has not made the requisite disclosures in respect of the said transaction to BSE and NSE leading to violation of the provisions of Regulation 29(2) of the SAST Regulations. I note that all the three aforesaid allegations are interlinked and will be dealt accordingly in the subsequent paragraph.   8. I note that the pledge in question was on account of bona fide dispute between RKDL and CIL. It is also noted that on December 21, 2011, RKDL had posted an update on the BSE website titled \\\\\\\\u201cIllegal Pledge created by Comfort Intech Ltd\\\\\\\\u201d. From the said update, it is noted that RKDL vide its letter dated December 15, 2011, had informed the public at large that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026the Promoters and the company are aware that the locked in shares cannot be pledged otherwise as stated in the Regulations. We and our promoters confirm that no shares have been pledged and Comfort Intech Ltd. in connivance with Comfort Securities Ltd. and their Chairman Mr. Anil Aggarwal had purportedly fabricated documents and misused the properties of the company and the promoters and have treated the shares as pledged in gross violation of the SEBI Regulations and other laws.\\\\\\\\u201d These rebuttals from the company demonstrated that there is enough material to show that the pledge transactions in question were vehemently denied by RKDL. I also observe that the so-called pledge has been undone by CIL by releasing 48,00,000 shares pledged by Mr. R.V Ravikumar, Chairman of RKDL, and thus, the disputed pledge issue has been mutually settled by both the parties. This fact was confirmed by RKDL vide its announcement to BSE dated December 27, 2011. Thus, all the requisite details were disclosed on BSE and were available in public domain during the reasonable time frame. In an another order passed today by the undersigned against other Noticees in the same matter on the disputed pledge issue, it was concluded that as there was no information asymmetry in the public domain as regards creation of pledge of shares and______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Comfort Intech Ltd. in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd. Page 11 of 14  subsequent release of pledge of shares by the Noticee as informed by RKDL vide its announcements made to BSE dated December 21, 2011 and December 27, 2011, respectively, the obligation on the part of other Noticees to make requisite disclosures under SAST Regulations would not arise. Applying the same rationale in this case and considering the same set of facts and circumstances, since the so-called pledge transaction itself is disputed, I am of the view that forming a different opinion in this case will contradict the position taken in the other matter and will vitiate both the proceedings and hence, I conclude that the allegation of delayed / incorrect / failure to make disclosure for the same set of transactions does not survive in this case against the Noticee in this case as well.   9. The fourth allegation is that on December 19, 2011 and December 20, 2011, CIL sold 48,06,000 shares (20.03% of total shareholding) and 28,18,719 shares (11.74% of total shareholding), respectively. In respect of the said sale transactions, CIL made disclosure to RKDL on January 02, 2012, with a delay of 8 working days i.e. from December 21, 2011 to January 02, 2012 leading to violation of the provisions of Regulation 29(2) and 29(3)(b) of the SAST Regulations. In this regard, the Noticee submitted that that it had duly informed the respective Stock Exchange i.e. BSE vide its letter dated December 21, 2011 and it has also been stated in the SCN itself that the said disclosures were filed with the Stock Exchanges on December 21, 2011, and therefore were already in the public domain. I note that all the relevant information about the said two transactions by CIL was disseminated to public at large on BSE website vide announcement dated December 21, 2011 and the same was also done within the stipulated time limit. Thus, though the Noticees made disclosures to RKDL with the delay of 8 working days, all the requisite details were disclosed on BSE and were available in public domain during the stipulated time frame. I find that there is no material to suggest any design to take price advantage or to cause any loss to any investor or to the company in this case. The non-compliance in this case was transitory and more than eight years old. In my view, such non-compliance is venial an", "Date": "2020-12-28", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Adjudication Order in respect of Comfort Intech Ltd. in the matter of Ravi Kumar Distilleries Ltd.", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/dec-2020/adjudication-order-in-respect-of-comfort-intech-ltd-in-the-matter-of-ravi-kumar-distilleries-ltd-_48588.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 58294, "unique_record_id": "6fb55b9c04SEBI20201228", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6680aeb0785891030647182c", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 01:02:10", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Disclosure Failings", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "one lakh rupees", "gpt_audience": "- Regulatory authorities\n- Legal professionals\n- Compliance officers\n- Investors and shareholders\n- Company management\n- Financial analysts\n- Auditors\n- Stock exchange officials\n- Corporate governance experts", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

Noticee in response to the SCN replied vide letter dated May 24, 2019 seeking inspection of documents in the matter which was acceded to. Accordingly the Noticee vide letter dated June 11, 2019 was informed of the aforesaid. Finsec Law Advisors (hereinafter referred to as the Advocates) on behalf of the Noticee submitted that they have are also in receipt of Notice under section 11 of the SEBI Act, in respect of another proceedings before the Whole Time Member (WTM) SEBI and that they are in process of preparing a reply and sought extension for submitting the reply which was acceded to. The Advocates on behalf of the Noticee submitted the reply to the SCN vide letter dated August 5, 2019, relevant portion of which is summarized as below: 1) ISF received the membership of NSE in 1996, and of BSE Ltd. in 2008. It is pertinent to note that the membership of ISF with BSE Ltd. was renewed in 2012, following a change Adjudication Order in respect of ISF Securities Limited in the matter of Mefcom Agro Industries Limited                           .               Page 5 of 18 in the deposit-based membership with BSE Ltd. With respect to trades on BSE Ltd. during the investigation period, it is submitted that it would take orders from its clients for purchase / sale of securities on stock market and pass them on to another SEBI-registered stock broker, Sam Global Securities Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"SGSL\"), since ISF was not registered a stock broker with BSE Ltd. at the time. Such trades at BSE Ltd. were executed by SGSL, in the name of ISF. The securities were credited to the respective accounts of the clients on the same day, or upon receipt of due payments from them. Similarly, upon receipt of instructions of the clients, the securities were sold by the Noticee through SGSL and proceeds of the same were credited to the respective accounts of its clients. Since, during the investigation period the communication technology was not very developed, mostly the client would place the orders over phone or in person at the Noticee's office. Besides this, ISF also did some proprietary trading through its personal account, which was also executed by SGSL. 2) It is pertinent to state here that during the Investigation Period, ISF not only traded in Mefcom's scrip but also traded in other scrips in accordance with the instructions received from its clients. The following table provides a name of some of the securities which were majorly traded by ISF on BSE, during the Investigation Period: Sl.No.  Name of the Scrip Quantity Traded  1 BAMPSL Securities Limited 70,200 2 Cerebra Integrated Technologies Limited 1,11,914 3 Dolphin Medical Services Ltd 22,85,726 4 Gangotri Textiles Limited 13,54,729 5 IKF Finance Limited 1,06,398 6 JK Paper Limited  77,364 7 Pondy Oxides and Chemicals Limited 37,12,095 8 Richa Industries Limited 12 ,09,236 9 Shiva Cement Ltd 10,51,634 Adjudication Order in respect of ISF Securities Limited in the matter of Mefcom Agro Industries Limited                           .               Page 6 of 18 10 Sumeet Industries Limited 34,49,947  3) The Noticee During the Investigation Period, the Noticee held the following shares on behalf of the following clients:  Sl.No.  Name of the Client No.  of shares (as on June 30, 2006)   No. of shares (as on September 30, 2006)   No. of shares (as on March 31, 2007)        1  Amit Garg  26,015        40,444 0 2 Avisha  Credit  Capital Limited                                  0 0   82,000 3 Jatin Garg   31,001  40,001  0 4 Mahesh Kumar Agarwal  1,60,000 1 ,94,000  0 5 Rekha Garg   4,941  41,811  0 6 Rabindra Kumar Jena  15,000  15,000  0 7 Soma Gupta  15,000  15,000  0 8 Subasini Jena  10,000  10,000 0 9 Sangita Garg   40,000  40,000  0 10 Trading Account  70,890 6,289          32,067  Total  3,72,847     4,02,545 1 ,14,067  4) As evident from the aforementioned table, the Noticee held only 1.67% of the shares of Mefcom as of June 30, 2006 and 1.14% as of March 31, 2007, while the rest of the shares were held by the Noticee on behalf of its clients, including Avisha. Adjudication Order in respect of ISF Securities Limited in the matter of Mefcom Agro Industries Limited                           .               Page 7 of 18 5) It is relevant to note that the transactions in the scrip of Mefcom took place in 2006-07, under the control of the previous management. Therefore, the present management had no knowledge of any irregularity with respect to such transactions. Further, due to the change in registered office, the contract notes issued to clients related to such transactions were not available, making it difficult for the new management to review the same.  6) The transactions on behalf of its clients are duly reflected in the bank account statements and the demat ledgers of both ISF and its clients, therefore, it cannot be assumed that trades in Mefcom's scrip have not been undertaken by the Noticee on behalf of its clients. 7) It is further alleged in the investigation report that Mefcom's shares were lying in the demat account of the Noticee from March - June 2006 till October 2006, it cannot be accepted that the Noticee was trading on behalf of its clients. It is submitted that as a general business practice, the delivery of purchased securities took place only after receipt of payments by the Noticee from its clients. While the trades in Mefcom's shares took place in March-June 2006, the payments for such trades were received by the Noticee only after September 2006. It is submitted that the Noticee was in possession of such shares only till such period as the payments were due from clients. After receipt of payments, the shares were duly credited to their accounts. It is important to highlight that even in the month of Decembers 2006, the shares were promptly delivered to the clients, without any delay. In this regard, reference is drawn to the bank account statements along with demat ledgers. It is submitted that merely because there was a delay in transfer of securities to clients' accounts owing to bona fide reasons mentioned above, it cannot be said that the Noticee was not trading on behalf of its clients. 8) It is further submitted that though the shares of Mefcom were held by the Noticee in its own name, separate trading accounts were maintained by the Notice to segregate its own holdings from that of its clients. As already stated, it is submitted that at any given point of time, less than 2% of the total shares of Mefcom were held by ISF in its own trading account. 9) It is submitted that during the investigation period, ISF used to place orders with SGSL on behalf of a number of clients, including Avisha. In the month of January 2007, Avisha Adjudication Order in respect of ISF Securities Limited in the matter of Mefcom Agro Industries Limited                           .               Page 8 of 18 approached ISF to place orders for purchase of Mefcom's shares on its behalf, for the purpose of short-term trading only. As instructed by Avisha, ISF forwarded the orders to SGSL and bought shares on behalf of Avisha. Since the trades were undertaken for the purpose of short-term trading only and also, due to a delay in receipt of payments from Avisha the shares purchased were not transferred to Avisha's demat account. Later, based on the instructions received from Avisha, the shares were sold on BSE by the Noticee, through SGSL, and the proceeds from such sale were transferred to Avisha's account. As evident from the demat ledger referred above, the payments for all trades undertaken on behalf of Avisha during the Investigation Period were received and settled by March 31, 2008. It is further submitted that during the investigation period, ISF had received orders from 8 of its clients, apart from Avisha for trading in the scrip of Mefcom.  10) It is important to highlight that similar trades were undertaken by ISF on behalf of Avisha in scrips other than Mefcom, and such trades were undertaken even after the investigation period. Therefore, it is submitted that ISF could not have known that Avisha was connected to Mefcom while executing such trades on its behalf.  11) On perusal of the document showing off-market trades, it was found that off-market trades with MFL was not reflected in any of the records available with the Noticee. It is submitted that the demat account statements of ISF pertaining to the investigation period do not reveal the execution of any off-market trades between ISF and MFL  in Mefcom's scrip in the month of June, 2006 or during the investigation period. 12) It is submitted that the above mentioned counter-parties involved in the trades relating to Mefcom's shares were not known to the Noticee and there existed no prior relationship of the Noticee with such counter-parties. It is relevant to note that the trades by Noticee with the above three entities were executed on an anonymous platform of the Stock Exchanges, whereby the identity of the counter-party to such trades were not known. Also, at the time of execution of such trades, the Noticee was not even aware of any connection between Mefcom and the abovementioned entities. Further, the Notice does not contain any specific averments to establish any connection between the Noticee and other entities. Adjudication Order in respect of ISF Securities Limited in the matter of Mefcom Agro Industries Limited                           .               Page 9 of 18 13) It is submitted that in the absence of any evidence establishing a connection between the Noticee and the counter parties, the total LTP variation caused by the Noticee cannot be calculated cumulatively with that caused by other entities. Further, since there existed no connection between the Noticee and Mefcom or Mefcom Group, the Noticee cannot be clubbed a group entity of Mefcom for the purposes of positive LTP analysis.  14) It is submitted that during Patch - 1, the Noticee executed 951 trades in 11,38,546 shares of Mefcom, whereby the net LTP variation contributed by the Noticee was only 2.4% of the total market positive LTP. The positive LTP contributed by the Noticee in its trades with each of the three counter-parties i.e. B.P. Comtrade Pvt. Ltd., Sunita Investments and Purshottam Khandelwal, were approx. 1.76%, 0.11% and 0.56% of the total market positive LTP, respectively. Therefore, the average positive LTP variation contributed by the Noticee in its trades is less than 2% of the total market positive LTP, which is negligible and not significant, contrary to what is alleged in the Notice. Hence, it cannot be said that the Noticee contributed towards 9.75% of the total market positive LTP variation along with other allegedly connected entities of Mefcom.  15) It is further submitted that during the investigation, out of 49.49% of gross buy trades in Mefcom's shares, the Noticee's buy trades constituted only 8.33%. Further, it is submitted that while net trades for most of the other entities were negative, the Noticee recorded a net trade volume of 3,98,077. Thus, it is evident that the trades undertaken by the Noticee were genuine and not executed with an intent to manipulate the price of the scrip.  16) It is submitted that the usual practice followed by buyers while trading is to place orders at price higher than the LTP, to ensure that the order is executed. Therefore, it is submitted that mere purchase of Mefcom's shares at a price higher than the LTP by the Noticee, in itself, does not amount to price manipulation.  17) It is also pertinent to note that while the allegations pertain only to Patch - 1 of the investigation period, there are no allegations against the Noticee with respect to its trades during the rest of the investigation period, i.e. from January 11, 2007 to June 30, 2007 (Patch - 2). It is relevant to note that the trades with respect to Avisha were primarily undertaken by the Noticee in Patch - 2 of the investigation period. It is Adjudication Order in respect of ISF Securities Limited in the matter of Mefcom Agro Industries Limited                           .               Page 10 of 18 submitted that the only plausible link by way of which it was alleged in the SCN that ISF was connected to Mefcom, did not even exist in Patch -1 of the investigation period. Whereas, with respect to Patch - 2, there are no allegations of manipulation of LTP against the Noticee. It is, therefore, submitted that the allegations regarding the involvement of Noticee in the price manipulation of Mefcom's shares are completely baseless and without any merit.  18) It is important to highlight that while significant gains have been recorded against each entity, with respect to ISF, there is a loss of Rs. 1,44,51,661. It is submitted that while the amount of loss stated therein is incorrect, it is pertinent to state that even SEBI has not found any unlawful gains made by the Noticee, while trading in Mefcorn's scrip. Therefore, the allegation that the Noticee has made unlawful gains while trading in Mefcom's scrip, cannot be sustained.  19) It is submitted that during the Investigation Period, the Noticee was under the complete control and supervision of its previous directors and key managerial personnel. In light of the same, the Noticee cannot be held liable for acts alleged in the Notice, which were committed by the erstwhile management.  20) Since the alleged fraudulent acts took place during the tenure of previous management, no remedial or preventive action by SEBI is required. 21) The Noticee further submitted that it should not be held liable for the alleged fraudulent acts committed during the tenure of the erstwhile management. Company being an artificial person is not capable of taking its own decisions. In number of cases, SEBI has held the actual wrongdoer (KMP / Directors) and not the listed entity. Owing to continuous losses, the erstwhile Promoters had transferred their stake to the present management. The present management of the entity has no knowledge of the transactions undertaken in relation to Mefcom\\\\\\\\u2019s scrip during the investigation period. The entity was very cooperative with SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s investigation.  The entity has suffered a loss of Rs. 9.57 lakh for the trades executed in the scrip during the investigation period. The allegation of fraud is a grave charge and therefore the standard of proof must be of a higher degree and mere conjectures and surmises will not be sufficient to hold an entity liable for fraud. Adjudication Order in respect of ISF Securities Limited in the matter of Mefcom Agro Industries Limited                           .               Page 11 of 18 22) The entity was a registered stock broker of BSE Ltd. prior and post the investigation period and not during the investigation period. For the trades executed on BSE Ltd. during the investigation period, the entity used to take instructions from its clients and pass them on to the stock broker, Sam Global Securities Ltd. such trades were executed in entity\\\\\\\\u2019s name, the securities were credited to the respective accounts of the clients on the same day or upon receipt of due payment from the clients. The entity denies any connection with the company or its Promoters. Further, entity also has no connection with the Mefcom Group entities with whom it is alleged that the entity has traded to make an impact on the LTP of the scrip. Trades executed by the entity were bona fide and was on the anonymous trading platform of the Exchange.  Trades executed by the entity had negligible impact on the LTP of the scrip.  9. Thereafter, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on December April 16, 2020. The Notice vide email dated May 18, 2020 submitted that it had received the aforesaid hearing notice on May 15, 2020. Further, the Noticee requested for extension of four weeks in view of the countrywide lockdown owing to the present Covid 19 pandemic situation in the country. The Noticee subsequently, vide email dated June 23, 2020 informed that the Noticee had received another SCN in another proceedings before the Whole Time Member (WTM) SEBI, wherein the facts, issues and Cause were identical with the present SCN. The Noticee further submitted that the aforesaid SCN was disposed of by the WTM without any adverse findings in respect of the Noticee. The Noticee submitted that a suitable order in line with the order of the WTM be passed in the instant matter. The Noticee further, submitted that it reiterates its reply vide letter dated August 5, 2019.       10. I note that a detailed reply vide letter dated August 5, 2019 was submitted by the Noticee in the matter. In view of the aforesaid, I am of the considered view that any further personal hearing in the matter will be a mere formality and will not further the cause in the present proceedings. Therefore I am of the view that no further personal hearing qua the Noticee is required in the matter. For the reasons mentioned above, I am of the opinion that the Noticee was provided with adequate opportunities of replying to the SCN and of being heard in the matter. Adjudication Order in respect of ISF Securities Limited in the matter of Mefcom Agro Industries Limited                           .               Page 12 of 18 CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 11. I have perused the SCN, written and oral submissions and other materials available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are: I. Whether the Noticee, by its act has violated the provisions of Regulations 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) and 4(2)(e) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003. II. Does the violation, if any, on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under section 15HA of SEBI Act? III. If so, what would be the monetary penalty, duly considering the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act read with Rule 5(2) of the AO Rules? Issue I \\\\\\\\u2013 Whether the Noticee, by its act has violated the provisions of Regulations 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) and 4(2)(e) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003? 12. The first issue for consideration is whether the Noticee by its act has violated the provisions of Regulations 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) and 4(2)(e) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003. 13. Before I proceed with the matter, it is pertinent to look at the relevant provisions alleged to have been violated by the Noticees, which are reproduced below:  SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities  No person shall directly or indirectly  \\\\\\\\u2014  (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner;  (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or Adjudication Order in respect of ISF Securities Limited in the matter of Mefcom Agro Industries Limited                           .               Page 13 of 18 deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange;  (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made thereunder. 4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices:  (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities.  (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following namely:- (a) indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market;  (e) any act or omission amounting to manipulation of the price of a security;  14. I note that the SCN alleged that out of the total positive LTP contribution of Rs. 661.06, the Mefcom group (group)entities  created a positive LTP of Rs. 15.03 (i.e. 2.27% of market positive LTP) by entering buy order first in 28 trades where counterparties were non group entities. Further, LTP of Rs.307.3 (i.e. 46.48%) was created by group entities wherein sell orders were placed first in 1017 trades by 267 non-group entities. Further, a positive LTP of Rs.77.30 i.e. 11.69% of market positive LTP was created in 230 trades by the Mefcom group entities including the Noticee while trading within the group. I find that the allegation rests on the premise that the aforesaid entities including the Noticee are part of the Group (Mefcom group) which includes 15 entities. The said premise requires evaluation of the basis of connection amongst the entities which are allegedly related as per the connection shown in Table at paragraph 6 of this order. Adjudication Order in respect of ISF Securities Limited in the matter of Mefcom Agro Industries Limited                           .               Page 14 of 18 15. I find that ISF has been alleged to be connected to the Mefcom Group based on two counts:  \\\\\\\\uf0d8 The first being financial transaction with Avisha Credit Capital Limited (Avisha) which is connected to the company.  \\\\\\\\uf0d8 The second connection is based on off-market transfer between ISF and MFL (Master Finlease Limited) on June 9, 2006, June 10, 2006, June 13, 2006, June 16, 2006 and June 27-30, 2006.  16. With respect to the first connection, I note that ISF has submitted that the financial transactions with Avisha were independent business transactions between a stock broker and a client. I note that ISF has submitted that since it was not registered as a stock broker of BSE Limited, it used to place order on behalf of its clients on BSE Limited through another stock broker, Sam Global Securities Limited (SGSL) and used to transfer the shares to the account of its clients as and when the money was paid by its clients. The same practice was followed by ISF for the trades of Avisha in the scrip of Mefcom. Without going into the merits of the practice adopted by ISF, I find from the material/documents available on record that though the entries made in the demat ledger for the period April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2007 corresponds with the summary of the financial transaction of ISF with Avisha as noted in the SCN, the same is not conclusive as the has not been supported by the demat statement. Therefore, the ledger statement cannot be an adequate proof to state that the transactions were in the nature of broker and client. Thus, it cannot be said that ISF and Avisha had broker-client relationship and the financial transactions were in the normal course of ISF\\\\\\\\u2019s business.   17. With respect to the allegation of off- market transfers with MFL, ISF has submitted that it had never had any off market transfer with MFL in the extant scrip. I note from the documents/material available on record that no credits have been made in its demat account for the scrip of Mefcom on June 9, 10, 16 and June 27 to June 30, 2006.

The Noticee vide its email dated December 01, 2020 requested to adjourn the personal hearing and reiterated that the present proceedings should not continue in view of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT) order dated October 09, 2020 in the matter of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited V.

The Noticee again requested to adjourn the hearing. The request of the adjournment was acceded to and an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on December 16, 2020 through video-conferencing on Webex platform. The Noticee vide email dated December 16, 2020 made additional submission on the moratorium orders for the IL&FS group.  9. On scheduled date of hearing i.e., on December 16, 2020, the Noticee was represented through its Company Secretary and matter was argued by Mr. Pradeep Sancheti, Senior Advocate as Authorised Representative (AR). He reiterated the earlier submission based on the replies dated July 29, 2020 and December 16, 2020 of the Noticee. During the hearing the learned AR contented that in the light of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT order dated March 12, 2020, there is a moratorium under sections 241 and 242 of the Companies Act in respect of the Noticee and hence, the instant proceedings are not maintainable.  10. The submission  advanced by the learned AR were mainly on the legal issues about moratorium and maintainability of the instant proceedings, which are important and needs to be dealt before commenting on merits of the case. In this regard the Noticee made following submissions: a) (IFIN/Noticee is a direct subsidiary of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited (IL&FS). IL&FS and its group companies (IL&FS Group) including IFIN are undergoing a resolution process initiated by Government of India through the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA).  b) On or about October 1, 2018, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble National Company Law Tribunal (Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLT), Mumbai, on a petition filed by the Union of India through the MCA under sections 241 and 242 of the Companies Act, 2013, being of the considered view that the affairs of IL&FS and its group companies were being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest, and it was pleased to order suspension of the then existing Board of Directors of IL&FS and appoint a Board in place and stead thereof (New Board) as_____________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in the matter of IL & FS Financial Services Limited (IFIN) Page 7 of 11 recommended by the Government of India. By an order dated October 9, 2018, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT was pleased to inter alia permit the New Board of IL&FS to replace/nominate directors to the board of its subsidiary companies (including IFIN).  c) The New Board was mandated to resolve the debt contagion across the IL&FS Group (approx. \\\\\\\\u20b994,000 Crores as on October 1, 2018). To enable the same, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLT, by an order dated October 9, 2018, permitted the New Board to appoint Directors on the Board of the group companies of IL&FS. Consequently, the nominees of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLT appointed Board of IL&FS i.e., New Board have been appointed on the Board of IFIN.  d) Following the order dated October 1, 2018, upon appeals filed by the MCA and IL&FS against the order dated October 12, 2018, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT vide an order dated October 15, 2018 was pleased to grant interim stay qua IL&FS and its group companies (including IFIN) on inter alia institution or continuation of suits or any other proceedings by any party or person against IL&FS and its group companies (including IFIN). The relevant extract of order dated October 15, 2018 is as follows: \\\\\\\\u201c6. \\\\\\\\u2026Taking into consideration the nature of the case, larger public interest and economy of the nation and interest of the Company and 348 group companies, there shall be stay of:- (i) The institution or continuation of suits or any other proceedings by any party or person or Bank or Company, etc. against IL&FS\\\\\\\\u2019 and its 348 group companies in any Court of Law/Tribunal/Arbitration Panel or Arbitration Authority; and (ii) Any action by any party or person or Bank or Company, etc. to foreclose, recover or enforce any security interest created over the assets of IL&FS\\\\\\\\u2019 and its 348 group companies including any action under the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002; (iii) The acceleration, premature withdrawal or other withdrawal, invocation of any term loan, corporate loan, bridge loan, commercial paper, debentures, fixed deposits, guarantees, letter of support, commitment or comfort and other financial facilities or obligations vailed by \\\\\\\\u2018IL&FS\\\\\\\\u2019 and its 348 group companies whether in respect of the principal or interest or hedge liability or any other amount contained therein. (iv) Suspension of temporarily the acceleration of any term loan, corporate loan, bridge loan, commercial paper, debentures, fixed deposits and any other financial facility by the 1L&FS\\\\\\\\u2019 and_____________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in the matter of IL & FS Financial Services Limited (IFIN) Page 8 of 11 its 348 group companies by any party or person or Bank or Company, etc. as of the date of first default. (v) Any and all banks, financial institutions from exercising the right to set off or lien against any amounts lying with any creditor against any dues whether principal or interest or otherwise against the balance lying in any bank accounts and deposits, whether current or savings or otherwise of the 1L&FS\\\\\\\\u2019 and its 348 group companies.\\\\\\\\u201d  e) Thereafter, the interim order dated October 15, 2018 was confirmed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT, vide its judgement and order dated March 12, 2020. In the order dated March 12, 2020, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT held that the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLT/NCLAT has the power to pass an order of moratorium under Section 242(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 by way of an interim order. The relevant extract is as follows: \\\\\\\\u201c50. From the aforesaid provision, it is clear that Tribunal/Appellate Tribunal is required to follow principles of natural justice and other provisions of the \\\\\\\\u2018Companies Act, 2013 \\\\\\\\u2019 or the \\\\\\\\u2018Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \\\\\\\\u2019 and of any rules made thereunder for regulating its own procedure. Since the amendment of Section 424 with effect from 15th October, 2016, the Tribunal/Appellate Tribunal is vested with the power to follow the procedure of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, in addition to procedure laid down in Companies Act, 2013 and the rules framed under the aforesaid Code and Act.  52. It cannot be said that NCLT while dealing with winding up matter or a matter under Section 241 r/w Section 242 particularly in a case under Section 241(2), which relates to public interest, the principle of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code cannot be followed.  54. It is true that power of moratorium u/s Section 14 of the I&B Code cannot be exercised under the Companies Act, 2013, but same power can be exercised by Tribunal under Section 242(4) of the Companies Act by way of an interim order, if the Tribunal thinks fit for regulating the conduct of the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s affair upon such terms and conditions, which is just and equitable.  58. Taking into consideration the aforesaid fact, we hold that Tribunal / Appellate Tribunal has ample power to pass interim order in terms of Section 242(4) of the Companies Act as passed on 15th October, 2018 and requires no modification/recall.\\\\\\\\u201d  f) The Noticee further submitted that the stay qua institution / continuation of any proceedings against the IL&FS Group including IFIN granted by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT\\\\\\\\u2019s vide order dated October 15, 2018 (as confirmed by the order dated March 12, 2020)_____________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in the matter of IL & FS Financial Services Limited (IFIN) Page 9 of 11 applies to proceedings initiated pursuant to the present Show Cause Notice dated July 16, 2020 before the SEBI.  g) In regard to the status of instant proceedings the AR vehemently argued that the office of Adjudicating Officer conducting inquiry has all the attributes of a tribunal. In support of this the Noticee submitted that the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court has in a plethora of decisions laid down tests which are to be employed to determine whether a statutory authority is a Tribunal or not. In the decision of The Engineering Mazdoor Sabha Representing Workmen Employed Under the Hind Cycles Ltd. and Ors. vs. The Hind Cycles Ltd., Bombay AIR 1963 SC 874, a Constitutional Bench (5 Judge Bench) of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court has held that a test to determine whether an authority is a Tribunal or not is to enquire whether the said body or authority is clothed with the trappings of a Court. The AR further submitted that the test contemplates an assessment of the procedural powers conferred on such tribunal to adjudicate upon an issue and also to determine whether the statute requires a Tribunal to act judicially and to comply with rules of natural justice. Further if an authority created by statute which has the power to do any act which will prejudicially affect the subject then irrespective of whether two parties are not contesting the dispute, the final determination of that authority will be a quasi-judicial act if the authority is required by the statute to act judicially. The Noticee further submitted that keeping the above principle in mind, the adjudication proceedings before SEBI has all the attributes of tribunal because of the following: i. SEBI acts as a statutory regulator; ii. the present proceedings are also in its capacity as a statutory adjudicatory authority; iii. SEBI is required to follow due process of law and principles of natural justice; iv. SEBI in the eyes of law is acting as a statutory tribunal and / or is deemed to be a Tribunal; and v. SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s decisions are also open to challenge before the Securities Appellate Tribunal.  h) The Noticee has relied upon various decisions of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, viz., in the case of Clairant International Limited & Anr. v. SEBI (2004) 8 SCC 524 the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court has held that SEBI acts in 3 capacities i.e. (a) legislative capacity; (b) executive capacity; and (c) judicial capacity. In the present case, by conducting a hearing pursuant to the SCN, SEBI is acting in its judicial capacity and therefore the moratorium order dated October 15, 2018 (as confirmed by the order dated March 12, 2020) is_____________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in the matter of IL & FS Financial Services Limited (IFIN) Page 10 of 11 squarely applicable to the present case prohibiting the institution and/or continuation of legal proceedings before SEBI. This decision has been followed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in National Securities Depository Limited v. SEBI (2017) 5 SCC 517.  i) The Noticee has also relied upon the case of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited v. SEBI, wherein the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT had the occasion to consider whether SEBI/Adjudicating Officer can conduct proceedings for imposition of penalty and/or other measures against a company in respect of which a moratorium order (under Section 14 of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018IBC\\\\\\\\u2019) has been passed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLT. The Noticee also submitted few facts which were recorded in the order are as follows: i. A moratorium (albeit under Section 14 of the Code) was operative when SEBI issued a Show Cause Notice to institute proceedings for violations under securities laws; and ii. The board of directors of Dewan Housing had been suspended and an administrator had been appointed to resolve Dewan Housing.  11. I have perused the submission of the Noticee made as above. I note that Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLT vide order October 12, 2018 had refused to pass the interim order in view of prayer of \\\\\\\\u2018moratorium\\\\\\\\u2019 made by Union of India. In this regard Union of India appealed before Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT and Hon\\\\\\\\u2019b;e NCLAT vide its order dated October 15, 2018 passed an interim order allowing moratorium under section 241 and 242 of the Companies Act and later confirmed it on March 12, 2020, in respect of IL &FS & its 348 group companies including the Noticee. I note that the confirmation of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT\\\\\\\\u2019s order dated March 12, 2020 is still in force.  12. I further note that Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT vide its order dated October 15, 2018 has held that tribunal has much wider power under section 241 and 242 of the Companies Act, 2013 than the powers vested under provisions of IBC. Therefore, the IBC will apply to the section 241 /242 of the Companies Act.   13. I agree with the submissions of the Noticee that SEBI is equivalent to tribunal in the light of the ruling of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court as relied upon by the Noticee in para 10(g) above. Therefore, as far as implication of moratorium is concerned, the direction of moratorium passed by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT vide its order dated October 15, 2018 is applicable to the present adjudication proceedings._____________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in the matter of IL & FS Financial Services Limited (IFIN) Page 11 of 11 14. I observe that the moratorium order was passed on October 15, 2018 and confirmed by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT on March 12, 2020, which is prior to the initiation of the instant proceedings i.e., on July 03, 2020.  15. Therefore, in view of the above there is a bar on continuation of the present adjudication proceedings as on date, in view of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT orders dated October 15, 2018 and March 12, 2020.  16.

In compliance with the direction of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, Shri. D. Ravikumar was appointed as the AO in the instant case.   3. Another Show Cause Notice dated March 23, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued with respect to the Noticee by the then AO. The SCN had inter alia alleged that the Noticee as a Promoter Related Entity (\\\\\\\\u201cPRE\\\\\\\\u201d) had colluded with the stock-broker and the counter parties in order to create artificial volumes and manipulate the price of the scrip of the company. The said alleged conduct of the Noticee had resulted into violation of Regulation 4 (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the PFUTP Regulations read with the provisions of Regulation 13 of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003.   4.

It was also alleged that the Noticee was holding 8.02%, i.e., more than 5% shares of the company as on December 31, 2002 and had sold more than 2% of its holdings without making any disclosures as required under Regulation 13(3) of the PIT Regulations.  5. The Noticee was asked to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be conducted against it and penalties be not levied under sections 15HA and 15A(b) of the SEBI Act. From the documents made available, I note that the said SCN could not be delivered at the available address of the Noticee.   APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 6.

Ravikumar, Shri Suresh Menon, Chief General Manager, was appointed as the AO in the present case and subsequent to his transfer, the undersigned was appointed as the AO vide order dated April 9, 2019, conveyed vide communique dated April 12, 2019.   SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 7. The SCN as mentioned above could not be served at the available address of the Noticee. On resuming the proceedings from where it has been handed over to the undersigned, effort was made to check the address of the Noticee from the portal of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (\\\\\\\\u201cMCA 21\\\\\\\\u201d). It was inter alia observed therefrom that the status of the company was \\\\\\\\u201cstrike off\\\\\\\\u201d. Adjudication order in respect of Divya Dealers Limited in the matter of Silicon Valley Infotech Limited   Page 4 of 5   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 8. Before proceeding with the merits of the case, I observe from the MCA website that the status of the Noticee is being shown as \\\\\\\\u201cStrike Off\\\\\\\\u201d. Since the status of the Noticee is showing as \\\\\\\\u201cStrike Off\\\\\\\\u201d, it was imperative to see whether the Noticee is existing or not.   9. On a search conducted on the website of the MCA, it was found that a Notice dated October 30, 2019 (Notice No- ROC/WB/248(5)/STK-7/Drive III/2019/2) issued under section 248(5) of the Companies Act, 2013, that the names of 306 companies have been struck off from the register of companies and such companies are dissolved as on the said date. The said list inter alia included the name of the Noticee at serial no. 124.   10. Since the Noticee has been \\\\\\\\u201cdissolved\\\\\\\\u201d, in the facts and circumstances of the instant case, I conclude that the adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee vide SCN dated March 23, 2015, cannot be proceeded with.

Based on the aforesaid findings of facts as gathered in the course of investigation, it has been alleged through the SCN that CNE and its Directors had devised a scheme to get sufficient paid applications for the IPO of CNE so as to ensure listing of the Company on SME-exchange platform of the Exchange with the help of those funding group entities. It has further been alleged that the IPO of CNE would not have received the minimum prescribed subscription had the funding group not funded the applicants. The SCN thus alleges that CNE Order in the matter of IPO of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited Page 7 of 44   and its Directors at the time of the aforesaid IPO, in connivance with the funding group entities have employed a fraudulent scheme to get the IPO subscribed in a fraudulent manner by directly/ indirectly funding the IPO applicants and the said acts are alleged to be in violation of Sections 12A(a), (b) and (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and 4(1) of SEBI (Prohibition of Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations, 2003\\\\\\\\u201d). Accordingly, vide the above-stated SCN Noticees have been called upon to show cause as to why suitable directions shall not be issued against them under the Sections 11(4), 11A and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992. 4. I note from the available records that the aforesaid SCN was served on all the Noticees by SPAD except on the Noticee nos. 4, 5, 6, and 8, on whom, the copy of SCN was served by way of affixation at their respective last known addresses. In response to the SCN, the Noticee no.1 (Company) vide letter dated October 04, 2017, Noticees nos. 2 and 3 vide their separate letters dated June 17, 2019 and Noticee no. 10 vide letters dated September 11, 2017 and June 12, 2019, have sought copies of documents like copy of investigation report etc. and have sought cross examination of the persons whose statements have been recorded during the investigation. Subsequently, in compliance with the principle of natural justice, an opportunity of personal hearing was accorded to all the Noticees and accordingly hearing notices were issued to all the Noticees informing them that their personal hearing is scheduled on June 19, 2019. However, the aforesaid Noticees sought adjournment of the personal hearing and reiterated their request for inspection of documents. After having provided them with the opportunity of inspection of documents on July 16, 2019 which was availed by Noticee nos. 7 and 10, the Noticees were again insisted for personal hearing on August 06, 2019. However, on the said date, only one entity viz., LMR Green Realty Pvt. Ltd. (Noticee no. 8) attended the personal hearing through video conferencing from Northern Regional Office, New Delhi. It is noted from the records that for the said personal hearing scheduled on August 06, 2019, the hearing notices had to be served on few of the Noticees by way of publication is newspapers as per the details below:  Table no. 6  Sr.  No. Names of the Noticee Hearing on 06.08.2019 1.

I find that although an adjournment request on behalf of Noticee no.1, 2, 3, 7 and 10 was received, none of the other Noticees appeared before me on the said date for the personal hearing nor have they requested for adjournment of hearing. Therefore, request of Noticee nos. 1, 2, 3, 7 and 10 was acceded to and for said Noticees, another date for personal hearing was fixed on November 14, 2019.  6. On November 14, 2019, Noticee no. 2 appeared before me on behalf of himself as well as on behalf of Noticee no. 1 (the Company) and Noticee no. 3. Subsequent to the hearing, a common written submission dated November 21, 2019 has been filed on behalf of the Noticee nos. 1 to 3, and thereafter another submission dated March 16, 2020 has also been filed on behalf of the Noticee no. 1. It is pertinent to note that Noticee nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 to 11 have neither appeared before me for personal hearing nor have submitted any written reply to the allegations made against them in the SCN, except for a very brief reply filed by the Noticee no. 10. The Noticee nos. 7 and 10 had vide their separate letters dated July 29, 2019 requested for more time to file reply to the SCN, however, no reply has been filed by the said entities after the said communication.  7. In view of the above, I proceed to deal with the matter on the basis of materials available on records including the submissions made by them before me, both verbal and written in course of the proceedings. Submissions of the Noticees 8. After perusing the written replies submitted by the Noticees (as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs) and having heard the arguments of the Noticees, the main arguments advanced by them are summarized hereunder: Order in the matter of IPO of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited Page 9 of 44   Noticee no. 1, 2 and 3 9. The Company and Noticee nos. 2 and 3, have filed a common letter dated November 21, 2019, and further a written submission dated March 16, 2020 has also been filed on behalf of the Noticee no. 1. In their replies, the following contentions have been made by the said Noticees:  i. The IPO of CNE was 100% underwritten in compliance with Regulation 106 of SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cICDR Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) and therefore the allegation that the Company was involved in getting its shares subscribed by acting in undesirable manner is not sustainable. Copy of the underwriting agreement has also been filed in support of the said submission.  ii. The financial dealings of the Company with the Goldline International Finvest Ltd (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cGoldline\\\\\\\\u201d) and all other entities were purely commercial in nature. Goldline is an entity listed on BSE and is in the business of buying & selling shares as well as lending and borrowing. CNE had no control on the business activities of entities like Goldline and other entities referred to in the SCN as funding entities. Based on the financial transactions carried out between other entities, no adverse inference should be drawn against the Noticee Company, i.e., CNE.  iii. Cooperation has been extended by providing relevant documents during the investigation and perusal of the SCN does not reflect that the investigation was hampered due to lack of information or remained incomplete for any reasons attributable to the Noticee Company. Rather, the SCN reflects that SEBI was able to conclude its investigation and the instant SCN was issued after conclusion of the investigation. iv. Vide order dated September 06, 2017, proceedings against 216 entities were disposed of who were initially prima facie charged in the interim order including entities having alleged association with the Company. The same shows that SEBI has not found any obnoxious irregularity pertaining to price rise and allocations in the IPO of the Company. v. The provisions of Section 12 (a), (b) and (c) of SEBI Act, 1992, and Regulation 3 and 4 of PFUTP Regulations are not attracted, as they have not dealt in securities, i.e., activity in the secondary market segment of capital market. vi.  During investigation, only selected transactions, particularly financial, have been picked up and the transactions executed by third parties have been made basis to make allegations, without appreciating business model of such companies. The matter requires Order in the matter of IPO of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited Page 10 of 44   re-investigation to appreciate the true facts based on the comprehensive investigation as has been done in various other matters.  vii. An amount of INR 1.00 Crore to Kirti Advertisement Pvt. Ltd. was advanced out of the IPO proceeds for pre-production of one Film, and the same was stated as one of the Objects in the Prospectus. A copy of ledger account of Kirti Advertisement Pvt. Ltd. in the Books of Accounts of the CNE along with copy of bank account statement showing transfer of funds from CNE to Kirti Advertisement Pvt. Ltd. have been filed.  viii. An entity namely Santushti Craft Media Private Limited and an individual namely Mr. Abhishek Maratha had approached the Company for production of Films and in pursuance thereof, the Company had advanced INR 1.60 Crore and INR 70.00 Lakh to them, respectively, for pre-production of film(s). The pre-production of films was stated as an Object of the Issue in the prospectus.  ix. Further, an amount of INR 15.00 Lakh (approx.) was spent by the Noticee Company for promoting the Company in film industries by hosting an event in The Metropolitan Hotel, New Delhi.

It has been submitted that the Company had, during the period of October 2012, borrowed INR 70.00 Lakh as short-term loan, from an entity viz., Oasis Buildmart India Pvt.

Copy of ledger account has been filed in the support of said transaction.  10. The Noticee no. 10 (Avisha Credit Capital Limited), vide its letter dated September 11, 2017, submitted that it is a Non- Banking Financial Company (NBFC) (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Avisha\\\\\\\\u2019) and in its normal course of business, it had provided funds to needy people and such recipients of funds have discretion to utilize those funds, as per their requirement.   Consideration of Issues and Findings: 11. Considering the findings from investigation conducted by SEBI, the allegations levelled against the Noticees in the SCN and the explanations offered by the Noticees through their verbal and written submissions, I find that the following issues require consideration in the present matter: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Issue I: Whether the Noticee nos. 4 to 11 are connected and the Company through connected entities/Noticees has funded the subscription of its IPO? Order in the matter of IPO of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited Page 12 of 44   \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Issue II: Whether the proceeds of IPO have been utilized by the Company in terms of the Objects stated in the Prospectus? 12. Before moving on to examine the charges on merit, it is noted that a few of the Noticees have raised certain preliminary objections such as non-furnishing of sufficient documents enabling them to defend themselves properly. In this respect, I note that the Noticees while requesting for inspection and copies of documents have not pointed out at any specific document, which has been referred to and relied upon in the SCN and copy of which has not been made available to them for defending their case effectively. Noticees have also not brought to my notice any kind of prejudice that was caused by the purported non-furnishing of documents, if any.  13. From the SCN, it is noted that to support the allegations of funding of applicants to subscribe to shares under the IPO and non-utilization of IPO proceeds as per the objects of IPO documents, the SCN is duly enclosed with necessary annexures that contain various relevant details including information pertaining to IPO allottees. Further, it is also observed that the SCN does not mention about the recording of statement of any person and thus no reliance on any recorded statement has been made in the SCN to make allegations against the Noticees. Therefore, the grievance of non-furnishing of documents and not providing opportunity for cross examination of persons whose statement was recorded in the course of investigation as expressed by the Noticees, deserve outright rejection. Notwithstanding the above, the issue pertaining to the necessity of providing documents including copy of investigation report to a delinquent has come up for consideration before Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Reliance Commodities Ltd. Vs. National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Ltd. (Appeal No. 173 of 2019 -Date of Decision -23.07.2019) in which the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT inter alia held that: \\\\\\\\u201cHaving heard the learned counsel for the parties and having perused the list of documents so required for inspection we are of the opinion that the documents sought for is nothing but a roving and fishing enquiry. We accordingly do not find any merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that these documents are essential for the purpose of filing an appropriate reply. 3. However, we are of the opinion that if any document is relied by the respondent while disposing of the matter such document should be made available to the appellant........\\\\\\\\u201d Order in the matter of IPO of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited Page 13 of 44   14. Having found no merit in the preliminary/ technical objections raised Noticees, I now move on to deal with issue on its merit.  15. As stated in the beginning, the acts of the Noticees during the IPO of CNE have been alleged to have violated provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 and PFUTP Regulations, 2003. It has also been alleged that there was actually no compliance of Regulation 14(1) of ICDR Regulations as the Company has resorted to a fraudulent manner and unfair method to ensure listing of its equity capital and the method so allegedly practiced by the Company was not in compliance with the rules and regulations in force at that point of time. At this stage, before moving forward to deal with the issues in hand, with facts unearthed in the course of investigation and evidences gathered in support of the allegations so made in the SCN, it would be proper to have a look at the relevant provisions as alleged to have been violated in terms of the SCN which are reproduced hereunder for ready reference: SEBI Act, 1992  Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control Section 12A.No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  (b)employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange;  (c)engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder. SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003 Prohibition of certain dealings in securities Regulation 3. No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 Order in the matter of IPO of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited Page 14 of 44   (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made thereunder.  Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices  Regulation 4 (1)  Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities. SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 Minimum Subscription 14. (1) the minimum subscription to be received in an issue shall not be less than ninety percent of the offer through offer document: Provided that in the case of an initial public offer, the minimum subscription to be received shall be subject to allotment of minimum number of specified securities, as prescribed in sub-clause (b) of clause (2) of rule 19 of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957. 16. I shall now proceed to deal with the first issue, as framed above to determine as to whether the Noticees enjoyed connections amongst themselves and whether the Company has indeed funded the subscription to its own IPO, with the help of those connected entities who are also Noticees (Noticee nos. 4 to 11) in the present proceedings before me.  17. It has been alleged in the SCN that the Company has got its own IPO funded through connected entities and then transferred part of the IPO proceeds to one of the funding group entities (Goldline-Noticee no.7) which was put up as a front to provide finance to the IPO Order in the matter of IPO of Channel Nine Entertainment Limited Page 15 of 44   allottees of CNE. The fund transfers made by the Company to Goldline have not been denied by the Company except for trying to explain that the said transfers were of commercial in nature. In this regard, I note from the records that investigation report has clearly found out several instances of fund transfers amongst the other Noticees as well (viz : Noticee nos. 4,5,6,8,9,10 and 11) and also between the other Noticees and Goldline, thereby sending an apparent message that there existed a close connection between the Company and the other Noticees and that all of them were part of the same group of entities who provided, directly and indirectly, financial help to the IPO allottees of the Company. Before I proceed to examine and record my observation on the specifics of funding aspect, it would be essential to first examine the allegation of interconnectedness amongst various entities the particulars of which are depicted in details with my observations in the table below: Table no. 8: Connection / Fund Movement between funding group entities Sr. No.  Particulars of Funding Entities/Noticees as per SCN -Connection \\\\\\\\u2013  Fund Movement amongst funding group entities 1 Goldline International Finvest Ltd. ('Goldline') (Noticee no. 7) \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Goldline received IPO proceeds of INR 5. 00 Crore from CNE. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Goldline had funded money to the Market Maker viz. Narayan Securities Ltd. and also to other HNI and RII category allottees. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Goldline is having fund movement with M/s. Mayfair Infosolution Pvt. Ltd., M/s. AMS Powertronic Pvt. Ltd., LMR green Realty Pvt. Ltd., M/s. Avisha Credit Capital Pvt. Ltd. and Aavia Buildtech Pvt. Ltd. Observation: From the examination of details as stated under para 5 and 10 of the SCN, it is noted that CNE (Noticee no. 1) had transferred INR 5.00 Crore to Goldline on 13.03.2013 i.e. the immediate next day of the IPO day.

In view of the significant +ve LTP contribution by the entities by trading among themselves it was alleged that the Noticee along with the aforesaid 33 entities i.e. Mindex Capital Market Private Limited (Formerly known as MKN Equity Brokers Pvt.

The aforesaid alleged violations, if established, make the Noticee liable for monetary penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act.Adjudication Order in respect of Accolade Holdings Private Limited in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 8 of 22   17. The SCN was served to the Noticees by email on July 21, 2020. Vide letter dated September 8, 2020, Noticee filed its reply.  18. The key submissions of the Noticee are reproduced as below:  a) Noticee submitted that the trades in scrip of PMC are of February \\\\\\\\u2014 March 2013 and the Investigation Period of the SCN is 29th March, 2012 to 31st March, 2015. However, the Adjudicating Officer was only appointed in 26th June, 2020 i.e. after a gap of more than 5 years. It is submitted that there has been an inordinate delay of more than 5 years in issuing the SCN and therefore the captioned SCN should be disposed of and no penalty should be imposed against us on this ground alone. In this regard following judgments of the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal are referred to: i. Rakesh Kathotia vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 7 of 2016), Date of decision May 27, 2019. ii. Ashok Shivlal Rupani vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 417 of 2018), Date of decision August 22, 2019. iii. Ashlesh Gunvantbhai Shah vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 269 of 2019) Date of decision January 31, 2020. b) The whole basis of issuing the SCN to us is that we are part of an alleged group of 92 entities and such connection with the alleged group has been established on the fact that we had received shares of PMC through off-market from an entity named Economy Suppliers Pvt. Ltd. who in turn had fund transfers and off market transfer with various other alleged group entities. c) The Company is in the business of sale, purchase, subscribe and dealing in shares, making joint ventures. The Company had researched on the price fluctuation/movement of shares of PMC on the exchange and based on that decided invest in the shares of PMC to earn a short term profit and in this regard the Company had authorized Mr. Narendra Singh (its Director) to purchase shares of PMC either off-market or on-market.Adjudication Order in respect of Accolade Holdings Private Limited in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 9 of 22   d) As the liquidity in the scrip of PMC was not that much Mr. Narendra Singh decided to purchase shares of PMC off-market. Thereafter Mr. Narendra Singh came in touch with Mr. Devender Goyal and Mr. Sunil Goyal who were the Directors of Economy Suppliers Pvt. Ltd. with whom further discussions with respect to purchase of shares of PMC had started. e) On 12th Febraury, 2013 price of Rs. 265 was fixed by both the parties for purchase of shares of PMC by us. On 14th February, 2013 sale bill was issued by Economy Suppliers Pvt. Ltd. Payment for the purchase of shares was made through cheque no. 476840 dated 14th February, 2013 for Rs. 2,65,000/-. However, as the price of the shares had fallen further after 14th February, 2013, the Company was trying to further negotiate the price for some time. However, the negotiations failed and as the cheque got mutilated, it was requested to transfer funds by way of RTGS. The below RTGS were made (through A/c No. 90491010011734) - Syndicate Bank, Hauz Khas, New Delhi towards the consideration of the shares: RTGS dt. 23.3.2013 \\\\\\\\u2013 Rs.1,00,00,000/- RTGS dt. 26.3.2013 \\\\\\\\u2013 Rs.80,00,000/- RTGS dt. 28.3.2013 \\\\\\\\u2013 Rs.85,00,000/-  f) Other than the above mentioned transaction there is no connection /association / reIation of our Company wlth Economy Suppliels Pvt. Ltd. or any promoter/director of PMC in any capacity whatsoever whether directly or indirectly. Therefore, we cannot be made part of a group as done by SEBI in the SCN. The transactions in the shares of PMC was a routine business transaction and without any intention to manipulate the price of the scrip of PMC or create any misleading appearance of trading. g) At this stage it is also important to note that off-market trades are per se not illegal unless the malafide intention of the party is shown and it has also not been alleged in the SCN that there was anything wrong in the offmarket trade done by us in the share of PMC.Adjudication Order in respect of Accolade Holdings Private Limited in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 10 of 22   h) Even assuming that we were part of the alleged group of 92 entities, it is submitted that the trades executed by us will still have to be independently looked into by SEBI in order to conclude that the trades were fraudulent and have manipulated the price of the scrip upwards or created misleading appearance of trading in the market. i) In this regard the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Premchand Shah & Ors. vs. SEBI (Date of decision 21/02/2011) has inter alia held as follows: \\\\\\\\u201c5....It is not in dispute that the appellants as a group are inter se related/connected to each other and that they, except appellant no. 1, have exited from the company by selling the shares held by them....lt is also on record that 74.26 per cent of the shares sold by the appellants had been purchased by the Ganatra group. The question that we need to answer is whether the sale of shares by the appellants and the purchase thereof by the Ganatra group was collusive. 6... It is, thus clear that during patch l, the buyers were far in excess than sellers and the number of shares offered for sale were far less than those for which buy orders were in the system. In such a situation the price of the scrip has to go up. It must be remembered that the price discovery mechanism of the stock exchanges works on the principle of demand and supply and if the demand is more than the supply, the price is bound to go up and this is the reason why the price of the scrip went up during patch I and not because the Appellants were conniving with the Ganatra Group. Since the demand was far in excess of the supply, the price went up. Another interesting feature of notice here is that there were large number of buyers and sellers in both patch I and patch Il and the Appellants who were the sellers are only 10 in number and the Ganatra Group which was buying consists of only 17 persons. It is clear that apart from the Appellants and the Ganatra Group there were large number of other buyers and sellers in the market which led to price increase. In this background, we cannot hold that the Appellants and the Ganatra Group connived to increase the price of the scrip.\\\\\\\\u201dAdjudication Order in respect of Accolade Holdings Private Limited in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 11 of 22   j) Also, in a recent judgment in the matter of Ashleh Shah vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 265 of 2017) the Hon'ble Tribunal vide order dated 18th April, 2018 has inter alia held as follows: \"11. However, mere fact that the appellant belonged Krupa Soni group could not be a ground to hold that the single buy order placed by the appellant on 06.04.2010 to buy 7700 shares of RCL was with a view to create an artificial momentum in the illiquid scrip of RCL. \" k) Merely on the basis that Company received shares in off-market, it has been alleged by SEBI that the Company forms part of an alleged group and therefore the SCN deserves to be quashed. l) It is brought to your notice that there has not been any fixed movement of price of shares of PMC on the exchange in the Investigation Period and SEBI has conveniently broken the investigation into 5 different patches to make a case. For example there has been a price fall in the Patch 2 of the investigation period and SEBI has alleged violation against those entities also who have contributed to price fall. In a common SCN, entities have been alleged to have contributed to price fall as well as price rise. SEBI on one side is saying that entities have wrongfully contributed to price rise and on another side saying that entities have wrongly contributed to price fall. Hence it is imperative to note that a common SCN could not have been issued by SEBI to these entities and that all the entities could not have formed part of a common group as done by SEBI and also could not be placed on a similar footing. The investigation itself is flawed and therefore the SCN should be disposed of on this ground also. m) The price of the shares of PMC were steadily rising March 2012 onwards and reached a high of Rs. 585 on 28th January, 2013. Further the shares of PMC were sub-divided in the ratio of 1:2 on 07th February, 2013. At this point the Company decided to invest in the shares of PMC and make some short term profit. n) The Company had purchased shares of PMC @ Rs. 265 per share through off-market on 14th February, 2013. The price of shares of PMCAdjudication Order in respect of Accolade Holdings Private Limited in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 12 of 22   was in the range of Rs.257 \\\\\\\\u2014 Rs.269 between 8th February, 2013 to 13th February, 2013 (Patch 2). o) Shortly after the Company purchased the shares of PMC, the price of the shares started falling and reached a low of Rs. 101 on 18th March, 2013. As the Company followed a stop loss policy for any investment, the Company decided to sell the shares of PMC thereafter to lower its losses. The shares were sold on market through Company's Broker Religare Securities Ltd. and incurred a loss. p) Our Company had sold a total no. of  shares of PMC on 25th March, 2013 and 26th March, 2013 (i.e. only 0.25% total sell volume on exchange during investigation period) q) SEBl has only provided trade log details of the trades which have contributed to the LTP. From the limited information provided by SEBI along with the SCN it is clear that we had only placed one sell order of 20000 shares on 25th March, 2013 (CP Order No. 14000015142863) at 02:58:25 pm at a price of Rs.107. The scrip of PMC had opened at a price of Rs. 108 on 25th March, 2013 and therefore the sell order was placed at a price lower than what was the opening price of that day so that the order is executed successfully. From the price volume data available on BSE Ltd. website it is clear that on 25th March, 2013 a total no. of 382 trades were executed on the exchange and 4,04,508 shares were traded.  r) However, the buyer placed 2 separate buy orders 22000020328338 & 22000020329015 at 3:04:13 pm and 3:04:42 pm respectively tor a quantity of 2000 shares each at Rs. 107 per share. Therefore both these buy trades of Embassy Sales Pvt. Ltd. matched with us. s) The last traded price before the trade of the Company was 106.5 and therefore when the Company placed the sell order at a price of Rs. 107 the trade contributed Rs. 0.50 to LTP. t) However, from the data provided by SEBI it looks as one other trade was executed belween these 2 trades of the Company at a price of Rs. 106.5, which later created last traded price for the second trade of Company toAdjudication Order in respect of Accolade Holdings Private Limited in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 13 of 22   be Rs. 106.5 and therefore again contributing 0.5 to positive LTP. The total LTP contributed thus comes to Rs. 1 through our trades. u) If at all we wanted to increase the price of the scrip of PMC we would have placed sell orders of small quantities and sell price always above the LTP. Unlike the buyer who had placed multiple buy orders of similar quantity in an interval of 30 seconds at the same price. v) LTP contribution of Rs. 1 in total LTP contribution of Rs. 776.25 (during patch 3) is so minuscule (i.e. 0.0012%) in a scrip such as PMC which was being traded in the range of Rs. 100-110, that, it cannot be alleged that we have manipulated the price of the scrip upwards. w) The above data clearly shows that we were a genuine seller on the market and there was no intention to create any misleading appearance of trading in the market as alleged in the SCN. The reason for selling the shares was the stop loss strategy adopted by us as the price of the scrip had drastically fallen from 14th February, 2013 till 25th March, 2013. x) It is also important to note that there is no allegation in the present show cause notice of any meeting of minds or collusion between the Company and the counter party to the trades or any of the alleged group entities which is a settled principle in the matters of PFUTP Regulation violations. y) In this regard the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Nishith M. Shah HUF vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 97 of 2019) has recently held as under: \"4... We are of the opinion that the impugned order cannot be sustained for the following reasons:- a. The investigative reports nor the WTM or the AO found any connection between the buyer and the seller. We also find that neither in the investigative report nor in the impugned order any connection has been found between the appellant with the promoters / directors of the Company. Thus, no causal connection has been established. b. The investigative report finds that no adverse inference can be drawn against the buyer merely because the buyer had placed buyAdjudication Order in respect of Accolade Holdings Private Limited in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 14 of 22   orders above LTP. On this basis, the buyer was exonerated from the charge of manipulation in the price of the scrip when admittedly the buyer was placing buy orders above the LTP. c. Buy orders were placed at 9.15 hrs and sell orders were placed during the course of the day but not immediately after the buy orders nor the sell orders of the appellants were placed before the buy orders. d. There is no finding that the appellant has indulged in fraudulent or unfair trade practices in securities. e. Selling miniscule amount of shares by itself is not illegal nor manipulative nor violative of Regulation 3 and 4 of the PFUTP Regulations unless collusion with others is found. f. Allegation that the appellant has contributed to the LTP cannot be upheld in the absence of any collusion with the buyer or promoter / director of the Company. One has to establish a connection between a buyer and with the seller in order to infer a manipulation in the price of the scrip. g. \\\\\\\\u2026. In order to apply the aforesaid test, the facts of the present case is that there is no direct evidence of collusion between the appellant as a seller with that of the buyer. There is no finding that the appellant was known to the directors or promoters of the Company. Since no direct evidence is forthcoming we have to see the indirect connection which is that the appellant was selling small quantities of scrips. Trading in small quantities in scrips is per se not impermissible as held in Ajmera's case (supra). If trading in miniscule amount leads to an increase in the price of the scrips one can presume or infer that the trading is manipulative but such trading cannot happen unilaterally. There must be evidence to show collusion between the buyer and the seller. In the instant case there is none. The principle of preponderance of probability cannot be exercised in the absence of any connection between the seller and the buyer.Adjudication Order in respect of Accolade Holdings Private Limited in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 15 of 22   h. The charge that the appellant had contributed to the LTP as a seller which resulted in the manipulation in the price of the scrips cannot be sustained in the light of the glaring fact that the same charge against the buyer had been dropped. i. In Jagruti Securities Limtied vs Securities and Exchange Board of India (Appeal No. 102 of 2006 decided on October 27, 2008) and in Vikas Ganeshmal Bengani vs Whole Time Member, SEBl (Appeal No. 225 of 2009 decided on February 25, 2010) the Tribunal held that the charge of raising price artificially has to be established and the element of collusion between the buyer and the seller is a sine quo non. We are in the entire agreement with the aforesaid decisions and reiterate that in the absence ofanyfinding of collusion between the buyer and the seller the charge contributing to the LTP cannot be sustained.\\\\\\\\u201d  z) AIso in a recent Judgment in the matter of Rajesh Jivan Patel vs. SEBI (Date of Decision 26.08.2020), the Hon' ble Tribunal has held as under: 19. In the light of the decision in the case ofM/s. Nishith M. Shah HUF (supra), we are of the opinion that in the absence of any connection between the appellant and other sellers and in the absence of any connection being found between the appellant with that of the buyer, the charge of collusion, manipulation orfraudulent transaction cannot be proved. It is reiterated that connection between buyer and seller is sine qua non for levy of charge of price manipulation which in the instant case is lacking especially when a specific finding has been given by the WTM that the main charge of connection with the company through Mr. Shailesh Parab and M/S. Mittal Share Brokers Private Limited did not exist. Thus, there cannot be any manipulation nor can the charge be levied solely against the appellant as a seller. 20.The finding of the WTM that the decision in M/S. Nishith M. Shah HUF (supra) is distinguishable as it is only relevant for synchronized or circular trades where a connection between buyerAdjudication Order in respect of Accolade Holdings Private Limited in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 16 of 22   and seller has to be established in order to prove manipu", "Date": "2020-12-22", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Adjudication Order in respect of Accolade Holdings Private Limited in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/dec-2020/adjudication-order-in-respect-of-accolade-holdings-private-limited-in-the-matter-of-pmc-fincorp-limited_48528.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 58151, "unique_record_id": "ba693848cfSEBI20201222", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6680a18a7858910306471746", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 00:05:52", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": null, "gpt_audience": "1.

Thus, as per the records, out of the total number of 30,24,000 shares allotted by the Company in its IPO, a total allotment of 25,92,000 shares allotted to 221 allottees were financially backed by the funding group entities, which were directly/indirectly connected to the Company itself. The aforesaid calculation of the allotment of shares by the Company shows that applications for as much as 85.71% of the shares allotted under the IPO were actually funded by the funded group entities.  xiii. Further, the Company was also alleged to have transferred large amounts of funds from the IPO proceeds to certain entities who had funded the applicants of the IPO. The said transfers included an amount of INR 3.40 Crore transferred by the Company to the  Order in the matter of Eco Friendly Food Processing Limited                     Page 9 of 53   Noticee no. 4 (Goldline) and INR 45 Lakh transferred to the Noticee no. 5, and both of these entities were involved in funding the applicants of the IPO, along with various other funding group entities. The details of transfer of funds out of the IPO proceeds by the Company are illustrated in the following diagram:    2. Based on the afore stated factual matrix revealed during  the investigation, a common show cause notice dated June 30, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe SCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to the Noticees alleging that the Company and its Directors, while acting in  connivance with the funding group entities, had employed a fraudulent scheme so as to ensure full subscriptions to the IPO of the Company by way of funding the IPO applications to the extent of 85.71% of the shares allotted under the said IPO, and have subsequently  transferred the proceeds of IPO to various entities including to a few of the funding group entities (after the successful completion of the IPO), either directly or indirectly and under  some pretext  or the  other,  as a result of which, the proceeds of IPO were not utilized to achieve the objects as stated and disclosed in the Prospectus of the IPO. It has further been alleged that the said scheme was devised to achieve  Order in the matter of Eco Friendly Food Processing Limited                     Page 10 of 53   the mandatory threshold of minimum public subscription of 90% of the shares offered, as required in terms of Regulation 14 (1) of SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirement) Regulations, 2009, (ICDR Regulations) (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cICDR Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). Since 85.71% of the shares that were allotted under the IPO, were alleged to have been funded by the Company itself indirectly through the funding group entities, the compliance with the statutory requirement in terms of Regulation 14 (1) of ICDR, was actually achieved by the Company in a fraudulent manner through the aforesaid scheme allegedly employed by the Company and its Directors. The SCN alleged that by the aforesaid acts, the Noticees have violated Section 12A (a), (b) and (c) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) read with regulation 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and 4(1) of SEBI (Prohibition of Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). 3. I note that the issuance of the aforesaid SCN was preceded by an interim order dated June 29, 2015, which was issued against the Company and also against three other companies, who were found to have followed common modus operandi in deploying a fraudulent scheme with respect to their respective IPOs. By virtue of the said order, certain entities including Noticee nos. 1 to 7, Noticee nos. 10 to 14, were put under restraint from accessing securities market till further directions.  4. It is noted from the records that the SCN was delivered to the Noticee nos.  1, 4, 11, 15 and 17 through SPAD, whereas for the rest of the Noticees, viz., Noticee nos. 2 ,3 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ,12,13, 14 and 16, the SCN was delivered through email. Further, Noticee nos. 4 and 11 had sought inspection of the documents, and it was informed to the said Noticees that all the documents in the present matter are common with other connected matters as well, and since as per the records, the said Noticees had already inspected those records in connection with the other connected matters (in which they are also Noticees), the inspection of the same material may not be warranted again during the present proceedings and can be dispensed with.  5. Accordingly, the personal hearing in the instant matter was fixed on January 31, 2019 which was informed to the Noticees. On the said date, only Noticee no. 3 appeared on his behalf as well as on behalf of the Company while a request for adjournment was received from Noticee no. 11. Thereafter, another opportunity of hearing was granted to all the remaining Noticees viz:- Noticee nos. 4 to 15 on August 06, 2019. The details of service of hearing notices to various  Order in the matter of Eco Friendly Food Processing Limited                     Page 11 of 53   entities for the personal hearing scheduled on August 06, 2019 by way of newspaper publication are tabulated below: Table 6: Details of servicing of Hearing Notices Sr. No. Name of Entity Hearing on 06.08.2019  1.

On August 06, 2019, Noticee no. 15 appeared through its authorized representative, whereas, a request for adjournment was received on behalf of Noticee no. 17. Finally, another opportunity of hearing was also provided to Noticee nos. 4, 11 and 17 on November 14, 2019 during which, again a request for adjournment was received on behalf of Noticee no. 17 but the rest of the two Noticees did not appear before me. Nevertheless, the request for adjournment of Noticee no. 17 was acceded to and accordingly the hearing was re-fixed on January 17, 2020. Noticee no. 17 appeared on the aforesaid date and was heard. 7. The Company, Noticee no. 1, vide its letter dated October 06, 2017 has sought copy of investigation report and other materials collected by SEBI during the investigation and to support their request for such documents, reliance has been placed on the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI Vs. Price Waterhouse (Civil Appeal no. 6003-6004/2012). Further, vide a common letter dated February 06, 2019, the Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 3 have filed a common written reply. Subsequently, the Company Noticee has also filed a written submission vide letters dated November 18, 2019 and March 05, 2020. The submissions made by the Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 3 through the aforesaid letters are summarised as under:  i. The IPO of the Company was underwritten 100% in terms of the provisions of regulation 106P of ICDR Regulations, 2009. Based on same, the charges of having arranged funds for subscription to the IPO would not be established. Copy of underwriting agreement has been filed in support thereof.  ii. The transactions executed with various entities, as have been imputed in the SCN, were purely of commercial nature and no adverse inference should be drawn against the Company based on the transactions entered into by it with third parties.  iii. The IPO of the Company was in complete compliance with applicable regulatory provisions. The SCN has been issued after gap of 4 years of the closure of the issue and accordingly, the charges should be dropped.  iv. Due to certain reasons, the Company could not furnish complete documents during the investigation. Had the Company been provided with sufficient opportunity to file all documents, the findings in the investigation would have been different, hence, in the interest of justice, a re-investigation may be conducted in the matter which would bring true and clear picture on record. In other similar cases like Confidence Finance and  Order in the matter of Eco Friendly Food Processing Limited                     Page 13 of 53   Trading Limited, SEBI has disposed of the proceedings against the Company and its Directors by directing reinvestigation.  v. The Company has spent an amount of 5.11 Crore (approx.) towards one of the objects stated in the Prospectus viz., Development of farm land for transition into organic farming by executing agreements with various parties. The agreements were executed by the Company for development of land, which was one of the stated objects of the IPO. As the agreements were executed with the mutual consent of both the parties and they were internal agreements between the respective parties, the same were not registered.  vi. Both the parties to the respective agreements have fulfilled their respective obligations, and there is no requirement for providing a project completion certificate in the business model of the Company. vii. As per the details furnished by the Company, the Company has not spent any amount towards other objects mentioned in the Prospectus viz., Construction of storage sheds, Solar fencing, Brand Building and General Corporate expenses etc., except a payment of INR 45 Lakh to Aviva Builtech Pvt. Ltd. towards the purpose of building storage sheds, however, admittedly, the said work was not completed and money has been repaid by Aviva Builtech Pvt. Ltd. However, reportedly an amount of INR 33.16 Lakh has been spent towards issue expenses like payment to merchant banker, BSE Ltd. etc.  viii. As per the records, the Company, in order to earn some interest income, had extended different short term advances out of its IPO Proceeds to various parties and has also utilized certain portion of the IPO proceeds towards repayment of its existing loans. 8.  As regards the transactions of funds involving various funding group entities as demonstrated in the diagrammatic presentation on page 3 of the SCN, some of the funding entities have explained their transactions taking various defences against the allegations made in the SCN.  Noticee no. 4 (Goldline International Finvest Ltd.), vide its letter dated September 16, 2017, has claimed itself to be in the business of financial activities (NBFC) and has submitted inter alia that it had received some amount from the Company which was an outstanding due from the Company, arising out of certain business transactions. Further, with respect to financial transactions with certain other entities viz., AMS Powertronic etc., it has been submitted that Goldline had extended the said amounts as advances for the business purposes of those respective entities and all of them have repaid those amounts to Goldline in the same financial  Order in the matter of Eco Friendly Food Processing Limited                     Page 14 of 53   year. Similarly, the transaction executed with Guiness Securities Limited has been claimed to be a loan transaction which was repaid by Guiness Securities along with interest to Goldline.  9. Noticee no. 11 (Avisha Credit Capital Limited), vide its letter dated September 11, 2017 and September 14, 2017, has submitted that: i. That it is a Non-Banking Financial Company (\\\\\\\\u201cNBFC\\\\\\\\u201d), registered with RBI and in pursuance of its NBFC activity, it had extended advances to certain entities including ECO and Goldline.  ii. That an amount of INR 3.42 Crore was due from ECO towards the Noticee no. 11 as on April 01, 2012. There is no other relationship with ECO.  iii. That the recipients of the funds have discretion to utilize such funds and the Noticee no. 11 was not aware of deployment of such funds to subscribe to shares in the IPO. More than 90% of the funds so extended were repaid to the Noticee no. 11 in the same financial year. 10. Noticee no. 15, vide its letter dated August 28, 2017, has made certain submissions in response to the SCN the highlights of which, are as under:  i. The Noticee no. 15 is a real estate broking company and it has no connection with the Noticee no. 4 (Goldline). ii. The Noticee no. 4 had approached it with some enquiry pertaining to a building at Noida and in pursuance thereof, 10% of the deal amount being INR 32 Lakh was received from the Noticee no. 4. The same was not connected with the IPO of ECO and the timing of the two transactions was purely coincidental.   iii. The Noticee no. 15 frequently makes investment in securities market to make some gains in short term. However, it cant be denied that some sort of futuristic prospects might have been discussed through \\\\\\\\u201cGoldline\\\\\\\\u201d officials at that point of time, taking reference of which but based upon self-analysis such investment decision was taken.  iv. The allegation of funding can only sustain if the amount allegedly funded is equal to amount received.  v. The SCN is vague qua Noticee no. 15 and no act of Noticee no. 15 can be termed as fraudulent or unfair.  Order in the matter of Eco Friendly Food Processing Limited                     Page 15 of 53   vi.  There is no bar to make multiple applications, which were made in the present case through the family and close friends. 11. Noticee no. 17 (Ace Consultants) has vide its letters dated September 04, 2019 has filed a written reply in response to the SCN and further vide letter dated January 30, 2020, it has also filed a post hearing written submission in which it has advanced the following arguments:  i.  There was no connection between management of ECO and Ms. Sunita Khemka or her husband.  ii. Ms. Sunita Khemka is the proprietor of the firm M/s Ace Consultants and Ms. Sunita is also a Designated Director of ISF Securities Ltd.

Prior to the SCN under consideration, adjudication proceedings had been initiated by SEBI in the matter of MPF Systems Ltd., inter alia, for misrepresentation of financial statements of the  Order in the mater of MPF Systems Ltd.                                                                                           Page 2 of 16   Company. Consequently, an order dated February 28, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAdjudication Order\\\\\\\\u201d) was passed by the concerned Adjudicating Officer imposing penalty of different amounts in respect of MPF, Ms. Kirti Salvi, Mr. Anil Kothari, Mr. Aakesh Chopra and Mr. Ambrish Barsati Pal under sections 15A(a) and 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with sections 23E and 23H of the SCRA, 1956. The details of violations and penalty imposed by the Adjudicating Officer are reproduced herein below for purposes of easy reference:  Sl.

SEBI, after examining the records of the adjudication proceedings, was of the view that the order passed by the Adjudicating Officer is erroneous to the extent it is not in the interest of the securities market, since the penalty imposed by the said order is not commensurate with the violation alleged and, in some cases, is less than the minimum penalty of \\\\\\\\u20b95,00,000/- prescribed under section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 vide the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014, for such violations. Considering the foregoing, proceedings under section 15-I(3) of the SEBI Act, 1992 have been initiated against the Noticees and a combined Show Cause  Order in the mater of MPF Systems Ltd.                                                                                           Page 3 of 16   Notice dated May 5, 2020 was issued to the Noticees herein calling upon them to show cause as to why appropriate penalty shall not be imposed on them under sections 15A(a) and 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with sections 23E and 23H of the SCRA, 1956.  4. The Noticees have responded to the SCN with a common written reply dated May 21, 2020 in which the submissions made by them are summarised as under:  (a) Another Whole Time Member (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cWTM\\\\\\\\u201d) of SEBI has also passed an order dated April 20, 2020 under section 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 in the same matter against the present Noticees, differing from some of the material findings of the Adjudication Order. Since the present proceedings are as a consequence of the Adjudication Order and the aforesaid WTM\\\\\\\\u2019s Order is also passed as a consequence of the same allegations as made on the Adjudication Proceedings, their replies filed in the aforesaid proceedings should be treated as part of their submissions in the present proceedings.  (b) The Noticees shall be assailing both the Adjudication Order as well as the aforesaid WTM order dated April 20, 2020 before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSAT\\\\\\\\u201d), therefore their reply to the present proceedings shall not be construed to mean that the penalties/directions of the Adjudication Order and WTM Order dated April 20, 2020 are acceptable to the Noticees.  (c) The allegation made in the SCN that the Adjudication of penalties have not been decided on merits or that it is not in the interest of securities market is vague and not supported by substantive material. In this regard, the Noticees have relied upon the case of Gorkha Security Services v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi), (2014) 9 SCC 105 and S. L. Kapoor v. Jagmohan & Ors., (1980) 4 SCC 379 to submit that the SCN fails to meet the test of a valid notice and does not indicate the precise allegation against the Noticees other than stating that the Adjudication Order is not in the interest of securities market. Further, the Noticees have also submitted that the SCN does not mention as to how the Adjudication Order is not in the interest of securities market. They have relied upon the following observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of Gorkha Security Services v. Govt. (Supra) -   \\\\\\\\u201cContents of Show Cause Notice  (21) The Central issue, however, pertains to the requirement of stating the action which is proposed to be taken. The fundamental purpose behind the serving of show cause notice is to make the noticee understand the precise case set up against him which he has to meet. This would require the statement of imputations detailing out the alleged breaches and defaults he has committed, so  Order in the mater of MPF Systems Ltd.                                                                                           Page 4 of 16   that he gets an opportunity to rebut the same. Another requirement, according to us, is the nature of action which is proposed to be taken for such a breach. That should also be stated so that the noticee is able to point out that proposed action is not warranted in the given case, even if the defaults/ breaches complained of are not satisfactorily explained.   (22) The High Court has simply stated that the purpose of show cause notice is primarily to enable the noticee to meet the grounds on which the action is proposed against him. No doubt, the High Court is justified to this extent. However, it is equally important to mention as to what would be the consequence if the noticee does not satisfactorily meet the grounds on which an action is proposed. To put it otherwise, we are of the opinion that in order to fulfil the requirements of principles of natural justice, a show cause notice should meet the following two requirements viz:  (i) The material/ grounds to be stated on which according to the Department necessitates an action;  (ii) Particular penalty/action which is proposed to be taken. It is this second requirement which the High Court has failed to omit.\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d  (emphasis supplied)  (d) The Noticees have also placed reliance on cases decided by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, viz. Siddharth Chaturvedi v. SEBI, (2016) 12 SCC 119 and Adjudicating Officer, SEBI v. Bhavesh Pabari, (2019) 5 SCC 90 to submit that the Adjudicating Officer is entitled to exercise discretion while imposing penalty for the violation of provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the SCRA, 1956, etc. including the discretion to impose penalty below the minimum penalty prescribed under the respective provisions.   (e) Further, the law is settled that provisions of section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992 have to be considered while imposing penalty for alleged violations and hence, in the given facts of the case the Adjudicating Officer can impose penalty below the thresholds prescribed under the SEBI Act, 1992 and the SCRA, 1956. There being no finding on whether any loss was caused to any investors or any disproportionate gain was made by the Noticees, there cannot be any basis for concluding that the penalty imposed by the Adjudication Order is low and must be enhanced when discretion has been applied by the Adjudicating Officer after considering the reply of the Noticees and granting them personal hearing.  (f) The Adjudication Order has prescribed penalty upon reaching an erroneous conclusion that the Noticees are in breach of regulations 16 to 19 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cLODR Regulations, 2015\\\\\\\\u201d) which have not been found to be established against the Noticees by  Order in the mater of MPF Systems Ltd.                                                                                           Page 5 of 16   the WTM\\\\\\\\u2019s Order dated April 20, 2020. Therefore, there is a case made out for reduction of penalty imposed by the Adjudication Order.  (g) There is negligible trading in the shares of the Company, therefore there was no intention of the Company to show a false picture to the investors or to give effect to any fraudulent practice. They have enclosed price-volume data pertaining to the trades in the shares of the Company to emphasise that there is no impact on securities market as a result of the trades in the shares of the Company.  5. Subsequent to receipt of written reply vide letter dated May 21, 2020, the Noticees were granted an opportunity of personal hearing before me through video conference on August 6, 2020, on account of COVID-19 pandemic. An Authorised Representative attended the hearing on behalf of all the Noticees and presented oral arguments on the lines of their written reply. In view of the above, the limited issue arising for consideration in the present proceedings is to ascertain as to:-    (a) Whether, the Adjudication Order is erroneous to the extent it is not in the interest of the securities market since the penalty amount levied against the Noticees vide the said Adjudication Order is not commensurate with the violations alleged and in some cases, less than the minimum penalty of \\\\\\\\u20b95,00,000/- provided under section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 (vide the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014)?   (b) if yes, whether the penalty amount qua each of the Noticees needs to be enhanced in the instant proceedings in terms of the respective provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the SCRA, 1956?  6. Before dealing with the submissions made by the Noticees on merit, I have to consider the submissions of the Noticees that the allegation made in the present SCN on the ground that the Adjudication Order   is not in the interest of securities market, is vague and not supported by substantive material. As mentioned above, in this regard, the Noticees have also placed reliance on the case of S. L. Kapoor v. Jagmohan & Ors., (1980) 4 SCC 379 to submit that the SCN fails to meet the test of a valid notice and does not indicate the precise allegation against the Noticees other than stating that the Adjudication Order is not in the interest of the securities market.   7. It is relevant to note herein that the imposition of appropriate and at least the minimum penalty as prescribed under the relevant law is of paramount importance from the point of view giving a deterrent effect on other participants of securities market as envisaged by the Legislature, considering the seriousness of various violations and offences committed in securities market, the legislature in their wisdom have prescribed for a minimum penalty to be imposed in terms  Order in the mater of MPF Systems Ltd.                                                                                           Page 6 of 16   of various relevant provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the SCRA, 1956 for different violations that may be committed under the Securities laws. The SCN has clearly spelt out that the reason for conducting the present proceedings is to adjudge the correctness of the penalty imposed by the Adjudication Order with reference to the minimum penalty prescribed under the law.   The SCN further proceeds to allege that the Adjudication Order is erroneous and not in the interest of securities market and requires consideration as to whether the penalty imposed on Noticees requires enhancement in the light of allegation so made in the SCN.  Therefore, the contentions put forth by the Noticees that the charges in the SCN are vague and not supported by substantive material, are not found to be presenting correct factual position hence, not tenable.   8. Further, it is trite law to state that an order which is not in accordance with law is an erroneous order. I note that the SEBI Act, 1992 has been enacted with the objectives to protect the interest of the investors in securities market and for the development of the securities market and to that extent all the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 seek to achieve these objectives. For example, section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 which has been invoked in the present proceedings seeks to prohibit fraudulent and unfair trade practices and provides for a minimum penalty of INR 5,00,000/- (INR Five Lakhs) for indulging in such practices. Therefore, by not imposing the minimum penalty prescribed under the, aforesaid provisions, the purpose of which is to inspire investors\\\\\\\\u2019 confidence and maintain integrity of the securities market, the legislative objective behind the said provision in the SEBI Act, 1992 is being disturbed. I also note that the SCN specifically calls upon the Noticees to show cause as to why penalty levied by the Adjudicating Officer should not be enhanced. Therefore, both the facts pertaining to the violation committed as well as the proposed action against the Noticees have been explained in the SCN. In view thereof, I do not find that the Noticees stand prejudiced, by issuance of the present SCN to them.  9. Adverting to the main issue of the present proceedings that revolves around the questions as to whether or not the Adjudicating Officer can use his discretion to impose penalty below the prescribed minimum threshold amounts as laid out under the relevant sections of the SEBI Act, 1992. The Noticees have placed reliance on the cases decided by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme court, viz. Siddharth Chaturvedi v. SEBI, (2016) 12SCC 119 and Adjudicating Officer, SEBI v. Bhavesh Pabari, (2019) 5 SCC 90 to submit that the Adjudicating Officer is entitled to exercise discretion while imposing penalty for the violation of provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the SCRA, 1956, etc. including the discretion to impose penalty below the minimum penalty prescribed under the respective Acts. The relevant paragraphs from the aforesaid cases relied upon by the Noticees are reproduced as under:  Siddharth Chaturvedi v. SEBI  Order in the mater of MPF Systems Ltd.                                                                                           Page 7 of 16   \\\\\\\\u201c9. Two things have been clearly stated by this Court in so far as the amended Section 15A read with Section 15J is concerned. First, this Court has indicated that by the use of the expression \\\\\\\\u201cnamely\\\\\\\\u201d in Section 15J, SEBI in adjudging the quantum of penalty under Section 15A can have due regard only to the three factors set out therein and not to other relevant factors as the expression \\\\\\\\u201cnamely\\\\\\\\u201d cannot be equated with the expression \\\\\\\\u201cincluding\\\\\\\\u201d, being an exhaustive provision on the subject matter covered by the provision. This Court has also clearly held that Section 15J would suffer an eclipse for the period 2002 to 2014 inasmuch as the intention of the Legislature, by amending Section 15A, seems to be that no scope for any discretion for this period is to be exercised, if in fact, there is any infraction of Rules or Regulations. This Court clearly held that the discretionary power of the Adjudicating Officer having been withdrawn, the scope of Section 15J would correspondingly stand drastically reduced.  10. Prima facie, we find it a little difficult to subscribe to both the views contained in paragraph 4 as well as in paragraph 5 of the said judgment. The expression \\\\\\\\u201cshall have due regard to\\\\\\\\u201d is a very known legislative device used from the time of Julius v Bishop of Oxford (1880) LR 5 AC 214 (HL), and followed in many judgments both English as well as of our Courts as words vesting a discretion in an Adjudicating Officer. The question which arises in the present appeals is whether the expression \\\\\\\\u201cnamely\\\\\\\\u201d fixes the discretion which can be exercised only in the circumstances mentioned in the three clauses set out in Section 15J, or whether it would also take into account other relevant circumstances, having particular regard to the fact that it is a penalty provision that the Court is construing. As this needs to be authoritatively decided for the future, it would be better if we refer it to a larger Bench for such authoritative pronouncement.  11. We also find it a little difficult to accept what is stated in paragraph 5 of the judgment. It is very difficult, keeping in view, particularly, two important legal facets \\\\\\\\u2013 one the doctrine of harmonious construction of a statute; and two, the fact that we are construing a penalty provision of a statute which is to be strictly construed, Section 15A, post amendment in 2002, is suddenly given a pride of place, and Section 15J is made to yield entirely to it. The familiar expression \\\\\\\\u201cnotwithstanding anything contained\\\\\\\\u201d does not appear in the amended Section 15A. This being the case, it is a little difficult to appreciate as to how one can construe Section 15A, as amended, in isolation, without regard to Section 15J. In fact, the facts of the present case would go to show that where there is allegedly only a technical default, and the three parameters of Section 15J would allegedly be satisfied by the appellants, namely, that no disproportionate or unfair advantage has been made as a result of the default; no loss has been caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; and there is in fact, no repetitive nature of default, no penalty at all ought to be imposed. What has been done by the appellants here is to fail to adhere to Regulation 13, as alleged in the show cause notice, which failure has occurred on three days and consequently, has allegedly not been repeated by the appellants anytime thereafter. If we were to read Section 15A, as amended in 2002, in the manner suggested by the Division Bench of this Court, it may lead to anomalous results in that the effect of continuing failure to adhere to statutory regulations alleged to have been continued well beyond the period of three days, and which continues till this day, has Rs.1 lakh per  Order in the mater of MPF Systems Ltd.                                                                                           Page 8 of 16   day as the minimum mandatory penalty under the provisions, which would culminate in the appellants herein having to pay Rs.1 crore in each of the three appeals. We do not think that this could have been the intention of the Parliament in enacting Section 15A, as amended in 2002. We also feel that on the assumption that paragraph 5 of the judgment is correct, it would be very difficult for Section 15A to be construed as a reasonable provision, as it would then arbitrarily and disproportionately invade the appellants' fundamental rights.   12.This being the case, on both the conclusions reached by this Court in paragraphs 4 and 5, as stated by us hereinabove, these matters deserve consideration at the hands of a larger Bench. The Registry is, accordingly, directed to place the papers of these appeals before Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for placing these matters before a larger Bench.\\\\\\\\u201d (emphasis supplied)  Adjudicating Officer, SEBI v. Bhavesh Pabari \\\\\\\\u201c2. Two primary questions, in a way interconnected, have been referred by the referral judgement and order dated 14th March, 2016 passed in Siddharth Chaturvedi Vs. Securities and Exchange Board of India. The correctness of the view expressed on the said two questions by a numerical smaller bench of this Court in Securities and Exchange Board of India through its Chairman vs. Roofit Industries Limited would coincidentally arise. The questions referred can be enumerated and summarized as follows:  (i) Whether the conditions stipulated in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 15J of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) are exhaustive to govern the discretion in the Adjudicating Officer to decide on the quantum of penalty or the said conditions are merely illustrative?  (ii) Whether the power and discretion vested by Section 15J of the SEBI Act to decide on the quantum of penalty, regardless of the manner in which the first question is answered, stands eclipsed by the penalty provisions contained in Section 15A to Section 15HA of the SEBI Act? \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026 4. For the purposes of the present reference, we may proceed to consider the provisions contained in Chapter VIA of the SEBI Act.  Sections 15A to 15HA are the penalty provisions whereas Section 15I deals with the power of adjudication and Section 15J enumerates the \\\\\\\\u201cfactors to be taken into account by the Adjudicating Officer\\\\\\\\u201d while adjudging the quantum of penalty. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.  6. Insofar as the second question is concerned, if the penalty provisions are to be understood as not admitting of any exception or discretion and the penalty as prescribed in Section 15A to Section 15HA of the SEBI Act is to be mandatorily imposed in case of default/failure, Section 15J of the SEBI Act would stand obliterated and eclipsed. Hence, the question referred.  Sections 15A(a) to 15HA have to be read along with Section 15J in a manner to avoid any inconsistency or repugnancy. We must avoid conflict and head  Order in the mater of MPF Systems Ltd.                                                                                           Page 9 of 16   on clash and construe the said provisions harmoniously. Provision of one section cannot be used to nullify and obtrude another unless it is impossible to reconcile the two provisions. The explanation to Section 15 J of the SEBI Act added by Act No.7 of 2017, quoted above, has clarified and vested in the Adjudicating Officer a discretion under Section 15J on the quantum of penalty to be imposed while adjudicating defaults under Sections 15A to 15HA. Explanation to Section 15J was introduced/added in 2017 for the removal of doubts created as a result of pronouncement in M/s. Roofit Industries Ltd. case (supra). We are in agreement with the reasoning given in reference order dated 14th March, 2016 that M/s Roofit Industries Ltd. had erroneously and wrongly held that Section 15J would not be applicable after Section 15 A(a) was amended with effect from 29th October, 2002 till 7th September, 2014 when Section 15-A(a) of the SEBI Act was again amended. It is beyond any doubt that the second referred question stands fully answered by clarification through the medium of enacting the Explanation to Section 15J vide Act No.7 to 2017, which also states that the Adjudicating Officer shall always have deemed to have exercised and applied the provision. We, therefore, deem it appropriate to hold that the provisions of Section 15J were never eclipsed and had continued to apply in terms thereof to the defaults under Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act.  7. Reference Order in Siddharth Chaturvedi & Ors. (supra) on the said aspect has observed that Section 15A(a) could apply even to technical defaults of small amounts and, therefore, prescription of minimum mandatory penalty of Rs.1 lakh per day subject to maximum of Rs.1 crore, would make the Section completely disproportionate and arbitrary so as to invade and violate fundamental rights. Insertion of the Explanation would reflect that the legislative intent, in spite of the use of the expression \\\\\\\\u201cwhichever is less\\\\\\\\u201d in Section 15A(a) as it existed during the period 29th October 2002 till 7th September 2014, was not to curtail the discretion of the Adjudicating Officer by prescribing a minimum mandatory penalty of not less than Rs. 1 lakh per day till compliance was made, notwithstanding the fact that the default was technical, no loss was caused to the investor(s) and no disproportionate gain or unfair advantage was made. The legislative intent is also clear as Section 15A(a) was amended by the Amendment Act No.27 of 2014 to state that the penalty could extend to Rs. 1 lakh for each day during which the failure continues subject to a maximum penalty of Rs. 1 crore. This amendment in 2014 was not retrospective and therefore, clarificatory and removal of doubt Explanation to Section 15J was added by the Act No. 7 of 2017. Normally the expression \\\\\\\\u201cwhichever is less\\\\\\\\u201d would connote absence of discretion by prescribing the minimum mandatory penalty, but in the context of Section 15A(a) as it was between 29th October,2002 till 7th September, 2014, read along with Explanation to Section 15J added by Act No.7 of 2017, we would hold the legislative intent was not to prescribe minimum mandatory penalty of Rs.1 lakh per day during which the default and failure had continued. We would prefer read and interpret Section 15A(a) as it was between 25th October, 2002 and 7th September, 2014 in line with the Amendment Act 27 of 2014 as giving discretion to the Adjudicating Officer to impose minimum penalty of Rs.1 lakh subject to maximum penalty of Rs.1 crore, keeping in view the period of default as well as aggravating and mitigating circumstances including those specified in Section 15J of the SEBI Act.\\\\\\\\u201d  Order in the mater of MPF Systems Ltd.                                                                                           Page 10 of 16    10. Apart from citing the above stated two judicial decisions, it has been submitted that law is settled that provisions of section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992 have to be considered while imposing penalty for the alleged violations and hence, in the given facts of the case, the Adjudicating Officer can impose penalty below the thresholds amount prescribed under the SEBI Act, 1992 and the SCRA, 1956. The Noticees have also emphasised that there being no finding on whether any loss was caused to any investors or any disproportionate gain was made by the Noticees, there cannot be any basis for concluding that the penalty imposed by the Adjudication Order is low and must be enhanced when discretion has been applied by the Adjudicating Officer after considering the reply of the Noticees and after granting them opportunities of personal hearing, while disposing of the matter.  11. I have perused the aforesaid submissions of the Noticees including the judicial decision cited above and note that the question in the present proceedings is not whether an Adjudicating Officer has any discretion while determining the penalty amount to be imposed on a Noticee only but whether he has discretion to impose penalty below the minimum threshold amount of penalty as prescribed under the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the SCRA, 1956. Importantly, it stands confirmed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhavesh Pabari (supra) that the Adjudicating Officer always had the discretion to apply the factors mentioned in section 15J while determining the penalty to be imposed. It is also seen from the Adjudication Order dated February 28, 2020 that the penalty amount has been determined keeping in view the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992 as well as section 23J of the SCRA, 1956. It is noteworthy to extract the relevant paragraphs in this regard from the Adjudication Order:  \\\\\\\\u201c51. It is not possible from the material available on record to ascertain the actual disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticees or the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default. However, I have analyzed the data available on record to assess the seriousness of the violation made by the Noticees and found that the Noticees grossly failed to adhere to the principles of corporate governance and accounting standards leading to the misrepresentation which is against the integrity of the capital market.   52. In the backdrop of above information the allegations against the Noticees are serious in nature. Therefore, there is a need to impose penalty on the Noticees which will act as deterrent in future.\\\\\\\\u201d  12. Sections 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992 enumerates the factors to be taken into account by the Adjudicating Officer while adjudging the quantum of monetary penalty to be imposed while adjudicating defaults under Sections 15-A to 15HB of the Act. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhavesh Pabari case (supra) have held that factors/conditions stipulated in section 15J  Order in the mater of MPF Systems Ltd.                                                                                           Page 11 of 16   of the Act are only illustrative and not exhaustive and any other relevant factor may also be taken for consideration by the Adjudicating Officer. It can be seen that the Adjudication Order dated February 28, 2020 has also taken other relevant factor such as the serious nature of violations made by the Noticees and hence he has taken a stand on  the need to impose penalty on the Noticees which will act as deterrent in future.   13. Reverting to pertinent question at hand as to whether reliance placed by the Noticees on the cases of Siddharth Chaturvedi and essentially Bhavesh Pabari is furthering their contentions that the Adjudicating Officer has the discretion to impose penalty below the quantum of minimum penalty amount prescribed by the SEBI Act, 1992 and the SCRA, 1956. I note that the case of Bhavesh Pabari dealt with the question of applicability of section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992 to penalty provisions that existed before the amendments made to the SEBI Act, 1992 in 2014, hence the reliance placed by the Noticees is misplaced.

A participant shall be prompt and diligent in opening of a beneficial owner account, dispatch of the dematerialisation request form, rematerialisation request form and execution of debit instruction slip and in all the other activities undertaken by him on behalf of the beneficial owners.   7. In view of the above, SEBI felt satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to inquire and adjudicate upon the violations of provision of DP Regulation and SEBI Circulars dated April 23 and August 31, 2010, by the Noticee. By a communication-order dated April 09, 2014 Shri Jayanta Jash was appointed as Adjudicating Officer to inquire into and adjudge under section 15HB of_____________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in the matter of Reliance Capital Limited  Page 6 of 14 the SEBI Act. Accordingly, a show cause Noticee (SCN) No. EAD5/ADJ/JJ/AM/OW/16794/2014 dated June 12, 2014 was issued to the Noticee. The Noticee had filed an appeal No. 90 of 2015 in the matter, before Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT). Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT vide its order dated February 09, 2015 disposed of the appeal, as SEBI had agreed to withdraw the SCN dated June 12, 2014 and to issue a fresh SCN to the Noticee. Subsequent to transfer of Shri Jayanta Jash, Shri Suresh Gupta was appointed as Adjudicating Officer by a communication-order dated July 24, 2017, in the matter, to inquire into and adjudge under section 15HB of the SEBI Act and section 19G of Depositories Act. Thereafter, vide communication order dated April 02, 2018 Shri Santosh Shukla was appointed as Adjudicating Officer in the instant matter, Subsequent to the transfer of Shri Santsoh Shukla vide communication order dated January 07, 2020 the case has been transferred to undersigned. It has been advised that except for the change of the Adjudicating Officer the other terms and condition of the original orders (whereby the aforesaid Adjudicating Officers was appointed) \\\\\\\\u2018shall remain unchanged and shall be in full force and effect\\\\\\\\u2019. It has also been advised that I should proceed in accordance with the terms of reference made in the original orders.  8. After the receipt of the records, the notice to show cause no. EAD-2/AP/VS/3147/2020 dated January 24, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee in terms of rule 4(1) of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) read with section 15I of the SEBI Act and rule 4(1) of the Depositories (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Depositories Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) read with section 19H of the Depositories Act with regards to alleged violations as per paras 4 and 6 above. By the SCN the Noticee was called upon to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against it in accordance with rule 4 of the SEBI Adjudication Rules and rule 4 of the Depositories Adjudication Rules and penalty be not imposed under section 15HB of the SEBI Act and section 19G of the Depositories Act for the aforesaid alleged failures.  9. On February 19, 2020, Mr. Vaibhav Kabra, Chief Financial Officer of the Noticee, requested for inspection of certain documents, accordingly, Noticee had availed the opportunity of inspection of documents on March 02, 2020. However, no reply to the SCN was filed by the Noticee post inspection of documents. Subsequently, from the record, I note that on April 20, 2020, the Noticee had filed for settlement application for settling the issue, however, later the Noticee has withdrawn its settlement application. Accordingly, after withdrawal of settlement application by the Noticee, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to Noticee on December 11, 2020, which was communicated to Noticee vide email dated December 02, 2020, further, due to_____________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in the matter of Reliance Capital Limited  Page 7 of 14 ongoing pandemic situation the Noticee was also informed that if it desire to not appear in person, it may avail the hearing opportunity through video-conferencing on the Webex platform. Mr. Atul Tandon, Company Secretary & Compliance Officer of the Noticee, vide his email dated December 08, 2020 again sought inspection and copies of certain documents and also submitted that due to travelling restriction Noticee would not be able to avail personal hearing. However, in this regard, option for availing personal hearing through video-conferencing on Webex platform was already given to the Noticee vide email dated December 02, 2020.  10. On the schedule date of hearing i.e., on December 11, 2020, neither the Noticee nor its representative appeared before the undersigned. However, Mr. Atul Tandon vide his email dated December 11, 2020 reiterated his earlier submission and also submitted that one Mr. Sameer Khobrekar who is aware of the relevant facts, is not well due to conjunctivitis. I note that the Mr. Atul Tandon who is Company Secretary & Compliance Officer of the Noticee, could himself attend the hearing so fixed on December 11, 2020. I am of the view that being Company Secretary & Compliance Officer of the Noticee, he will be well versed with the matter, moreover, the Noticee was also given an option to avail the opportunity of personal hearing through video-conferencing, where neither the travelling restriction nor the contact with any person come into the picture. Hence, the request of the Noticee was not accepted. Vide SCN and notice of hearing, the Noticee was clearly notified that if the Noticee fails to file its reply to SCN and also fails to avail the opportunity of personal hearing the matter shall be proceeded further based on the material available on record.  11. I note that despite sufficient opportunity being given to the Noticee, the Noticee itself chose not to avail the opportunity of personal hearing. Therefore, I am bound to proceed further based on the material available on record.  12. The only submission which the Noticee has made are as follows: a) Despite issuance of administrative warning instant proceeding has been initiated, b) Instant proceedings suffer from delay, and c) Inspection of the relevant documents has not been provided.  13. I have considered the allegation levelled in the SCN, reply / submission of the Noticee and the relevant material brought on record. The Noticee has raised contention regarding the appointment of erstwhile AO Shri Jatyanta Jash after the issuance of Administrating warning by the SEBI. In this regard I note from the record that initially, SEBI had ordered inspection of RCL. The focus of the inspection was to understand the Investor Grievances Redressal_____________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in the matter of Reliance Capital Limited  Page 8 of 14 Mechanism followed by RCL as Depository Participant (DP). However, on being informed by CDSL that DP functions and all the relevant records/documents of RCL had been transferred to RSL, SEBI had conducted inspection of RSL on August 13-14, 2012 for the duration of April 2010 to March 2012. Pursuant to observation found during the inspection the same was communicated to RSL and accordingly RSL has replied to the observation of the inspection.  14. I note from the record that during the inspection SEBI observed that all the instances where rules and regulation of SEBI Act has been breached were during the major period of RCL carrying out the DP functions and the DP functions of RCL was transferred later on to RSL. Thereafter, an administrating warning was issued by SEBI vide letter dated March 21, 2014, to the RCL for the conduct which were rectifiable in nature and mainly on (a) No email id was specifically marked for DP related complaints, (b) Mismatch in number of complaints submitted to SEBI vide pre inspection questionnaire and CDSL vide Investor grievance reports and (c) Wrong classification of complaints. The adjudication proceedings were initiated for the rest of its misconduct as per allegations made in the SCN. Therefore, these proceedings are in addition to and not in duplication of the charges for which Administrative Warning was issued.  15. I note that accordingly, Shri Jayanta Jash was appointed as AO in the matter and SCN was issued to RCL. Later RCL filed an appeal in Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT on the ground that SEBI did not have the jurisdiction to initiate adjudication proceedings pursuant to issuing administrative warning, on the same set of facts and without any new/additional discovery, as the same would amount to double jeopardy and would be bared by the principles of res judicata and principles of analogues thereto. I note from the record that the ground raised by the Noticee is factually incorrect as the administrative warning issues pertained to certain violations which were rectifiable in nature and whereas the violation as alleged for the adjudication proceedings were different in nature. Therefore, in view of the above the contention of the Noticee is not tenable.  16. The Noticee has contended that the instant proceedings suffer from delay, in this regard I note that due to the nature of the allegation as alleged in the instant proceedings and transfer of DP functions from RCL to RSL, there were some technical issues, for which SEBI had to take a view to ascertain the initiation of these proceedings. Further, in addition to above due to various reasons whether, its transfer or superannuation of the erstwhile AOs, the case has been assigned to different AOs for adjudication proceedings. The factual basis on which the SCN dated June 12, 2014 was issued are same as there is no change in report and fact findings of the inspection. However, there is an apparent change in charging provisions. As regards the SCN dated June 12, 2014, I note from the order dated February 09, 2015 by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT that SEBI agreed to issue_____________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in the matter of Reliance Capital Limited  Page 9 of 14 fresh show cause notice to the Noticee. Thereafter, various legal and technical issues arose as discussed in para 14 and they were settled and thereupon a fresh communication-order was issued by competent authority for the appointment of AOs in the matter which ultimately led to issue of the instant SCN dated January 24, 2020 to the Noticee. As regards the issue of delay raised by the Noticee I observe that in the case of Ravi Mohan & Ors. Vs. SEBI (SAT Appeal No. 97 of 2014 decided on 16.12.2015), Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT while referring to its own decision in HB StockHoldings case (Appeal no. 112 of 2013 decided on August 08, 2013) and decision of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in Collector of Central Excise, New Delhi vs. Bhagsons Paint Industry (India) reported in 2003 (158) ELT 129 (S.C.), held as under:  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026Based on decision of this Tribunal in case of HB Stockholdings Ltd. vs. SEBI (Appeal no. 114 of 2012 decided on 27.08.2013) it is contended on behalf of the appellants that in view of the delay of more than 8 years in issuing the show cause notice, the impugned order is liable to be quashed and set aside. There is no merit in this contention, because, this Tribunal while setting aside the decision of SEBI on merits has clearly held in para 20 of the order, that delay itself may not be fatal in each and every case. Moreover, the Apex Court in case of Collector of Central Excise, New Delhi vs. Bhagsons Paint Industry (India) reported in 2003 (158) ELT 129 (S.C) has held that if there no statutory bar for adjudicating the matter beyond a particular date, the Tribunal cannot set aside the adjudication order merely on the ground that the adjudication order is passed after a lapse of several years from the date of issuing notice\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  17. The Noticee has further contended that SEBI has not provided it with all the relevant documents, reports and had not provided inspection of the said documents, in this regard, I note that the Noticee had availed the opportunity of inspection of relevant relied upon documents on March 02, 2020. Further, I note that all the relied upon copies of the documents in the matter were provided to the Noticee alongwith the SCN. Therefore, the contention of the Noticee was not accepted and hence rejected. Moreover, in this context, it is settled position of law that only the relied upon documents has to be provided for inspection to the Noticee and the same position has been upheld by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, various Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Courts and also by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in number of its rulings. In the recent ruling of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the case of Shruti Vora Vs. Securities and Exchange Board of India, in Appeal Number 28 of 2020 decided on February 12, 2020 held that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026The contention that the appellant is entitled for copies of all the documents in possession of the AO which has not been relied upon at the preliminary stage when the AO has not formed any opinion as to whether any inquiry at all is required to he held cannot be accepted. A bare reading of the provisions of the Act and the Rules as referred to above do not provide supply of documents upon which no reliance has been placed by the AO, nor even the principles of natural justice require supply of such documents_____________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in the matter of Reliance Capital Limited  Page 10 of 14 which has not been relied upon by the AO. We are of the opinion that we cannot compel the AO to deviate from the prescribed procedure and supply of such documents which is not warranted in law. In our view, on a reading of the Act and the Rules we find that there is no duty cast upon the AO to disclose or provide all the documents in his possession especially when such documents are not being relied upon\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  18. I note from the record that on the merits of the case, the Noticee has not filed any reply pertaining to the allegation as alleged in the SCN rather it has raised its objection on the appointment of the undersigned as AO and initiation of the instant proceedings. Further, in this case, in absence of any response from the Noticee, and non-availability of any material suggesting contrary to the charges/allegation, the only possible conclusion is that the allegation and charges have been admitted by the Noticee. In this regard, the observations of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Classic Credit Ltd. vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 68 of 2003 decided on December 08, 2006) are relevant to rely upon wherein it has that- \"\\\\\\\\u2026 the appellants did not file any reply to the second show-cause notice. This being so, it has to be presumed that the charges alleged against them in the show cause notice were admitted by them\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Others vs SEBI (Appeal No. 68 of 2013 decided on February 11, 2014), has, inter alia, observed that: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted charges levelled against them in the show cause notices...\\\\\\\\u201d  19. Despite the above legal position , I consider it necessary to deal with the allegation in this matter as under: a) In terms of regulation 52 of the DP Regulations, the DPs are restricted from delegating its functions as DP to any other person, without the prior approval of the depository. I note from the record that in the process of Investor grievance redressal mechanism, there were certain complaints against RCL as DP and in reply to those complaints the replies were given by RSL in the capacity of DP to CDSL/the Complainants. I, further note from the record that the DP functions of RCL was transfer to RSL way later than filing of those replies to CDSL/the Complainants. Hence, I am inclined to take a view that the Noticee has delegated its function as DP to RSL and thus, in violation of the provisions of regulation 52 of DP Regulations and clause 2 of the Code of the Conduct specified under Third schedule read with regulation 20AA of the DP Regulations.  b) As per regulation 42(2) and 42(3) the Noticee was obligated to transfer of securities to or from a beneficial owners account only on receipt of instruction from the beneficial owner. As alleged in the SCN and more specifically in para 5 of this order, the Noticee failed to_____________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in the matter of Reliance Capital Limited  Page 11 of 14 provide any receipt of instruction (electronic or otherwise). Therefore, the Noticee has violated the provisions of regulation 42(2) and 42(3) of DP Regulations and clause 2 and 4 of the Code of the Conduct specified under Third schedule read with regulation 20AA of the DP Regulations.  c) Further, SEBI vide Circulars dated April 2, 2010 and later clarified by August 31, 2010 instructed the Stock Broker and DP that PoA executed in favour of Stock Broker and DP by the client should \\\\\\\\u2018be revocable at any time, without notice\\\\\\\\u201d. Vide aforesaid circulars it was also directed that stock brokers shall take necessary steps to implement the circular dated April 23, 2010 latest by May 31, 2010 for the new clients and ensure to take necessary steps latest by September 01, 2020 to revoke those authorization given by the existing clients to the stock brokers and DP. However, from the record, I note that the complaints as alleged in the SCN were post the issuance of the circulars where the RCL have not revoked the PoA of the complainants. Thus, it implies that the aforesaid complaints would not have occurred in first place, if the RCL had revoked the PoA and implemented the circular dated April 23, 2020. Therefore, in view of the above, I am of the view that RCL has violated the SEBI circular dated April 23, 2010 and August 31, 2010.  d) Therefore, the breach in the facts and circumstances as found hereinabove, in my view attracts the monetary penalty under section 15HB of the SEBI Act and 19G of the Depositories Act, which read as follows:  SEBI Act Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided. 15HB. Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees.  Depositories Act Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided. 19G. Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or the regulations or bye-laws made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees._____________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in the matter of Reliance Capital Limited  Page 12 of 14 20. Further, in these facts and circumstances of the case, the quantum of penalty has to be adjudged taking into account the conduct of the Noticee as found in this case and the principle of proportionality. The failure as found in this case, had clearly defeated the purposes of the DP Regulations i.e. investor protection and ensuring regulation of market.

Page 3 of 10        In view of the above I am the sole Independent Professional Director of the company without any shareholding in the Company, and in order to comply with the provisions of Companies Act, 2013, the Company ought to have a minimum two directors on its board. Due to this infirmity I have not been able to convene any General Meeting of the members of the company to suitably populate the Board and empower persons to act on behalf of the Company.  In light of this, we request you to grant us 8 weeks\\\\\\\\u2019 time enabling me to convene a meeting of the members of the Company and seek necessary instructions from the shareholders of the Company in relation to the compliance with the SEBI (LODR) Guidelines.\\\\\\\\u201d  5. Subsequently, vide email dated October 06, 2020, an opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticee on October 20, 2020. However, the Noticee failed to appear for the said hearing and the independent director of the company vide its letter dated October 19, 2020 made the following submissions on behalf of the Noticee : \\\\\\\\u201cI am the sole Independent Professional Director of the company without any shareholding in the Company, and in order to comply with the provisions of Companies Act, 2013, the Company ought to have a minimum two directors on its board. Due to this infirmity I have not been able to convene any General Meeting of the members of the company to suitably populate the Board and empower persons to act on behalf of the Company.  In view of the above developments convened two Extra Ordinary General meetings scheduled to have been held on September 07, 2020 and on October 03,2020 seeking directions from the MAIF Investments India 2 PTE Limited and MAIF Investments India PTE Limited who are holding 51% of the share capital of Ind-Barath Thermotek Private Limited, strangely none of them attended the meeting nor did they give any directions how to proceed further in this matter.

Ltd.                                                                         Page 4 of 10        In the light of this, we request you to grant us another 8 weeks\\\\\\\\u2019 time enabling me to obtain necessary instructions from the Majority shareholders of the Company in relation to the compliance with the SEBI (LODR) Guidelines.\\\\\\\\u201d  6. Subsequently, in the interest of natural justice, vide email dated October 20, 2020, the Noticee was granted another opportunity of personal hearing on November 23, 2020. It is pertinent to mention here that vide the said email it was clearly indicated that in case of failure to appear before the undersigned, the case would be proceeded with ex-parte on the basis of the material available on record. However, the Noticee neither appeared for the said hearing nor filed any reply in this regard.  7. Considering the fact that the Noticee has not availed the opportunity of personal hearing despite being granted opportunities for the same, I am of the view that the Noticee has nothing more to submit, and in terms of rule 4(7) of the Rules, the matter can be proceeded ex-parte on the basis of material available on record. Therefore, the present proceedings against the Noticee are undertaken ex-parte on the basis of available documents and information.  ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS 8. I have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case and the material available on record and the issues that arise for consideration in the present case are: a. Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of the LODR Regulations?  b. Does the violation, if any, on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under Section 15 A(b) of the SEBI Act? c. If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15 J of the SEBI Act?

Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of LODR Regulations, which reads as under: Regulation 52(1) \\\\\\\\u201cThe listed entity shall prepare and submit un-audited or audited financial results on a half yearly basis in the format as specified by the Board within forty-five days from the end of the half year to the recognised stock exchange(s). Provided that in case of entities which have listed their equity shares and debt securities, a copy of  the  financial  results  submitted  to  stock  exchanges  shall  be  provided  to  Debenture Trustees on the same day the information is submitted to stock exchanges.\\\\\\\\u201d  Regulation 52(4) \\\\\\\\u201cThe listed entity, while submitting half yearly / annual financial results, shall disclose the following line items along with the financial results: (a) credit rating and change in credit rating (if any); (b) asset cover available, in case of non-convertible debt securities; (c) debt-equity ratio; (d) previous due date for the payment of interest / dividend for non-convertible redeemable preference shares / repayment of principal of non-convertible preference shares / non-convertible debt securities and whether the same has been paid or not; and,  (e) next due date for the payment of interest/ dividend of non-convertible preference shares /principal along with the amount of interest / dividend of non-convertible preference shares payable and the redemption amount;  (f) debt service coverage ratio;  (g) interest service coverage ratio; (h) outstanding redeemable preference shares (quantity and value); (i) capital redemption reserve/debenture redemption reserve; Adjudication Order in respect of Ind Barath Thermotek Pvt. Ltd.                                                                         Page 6 of 10        (j) net worth; (k) net profit after tax; (l) earnings per share: Provided that the requirement of disclosures of debt service coverage ratio, asset cover and interest service coverage ratio shall not be applicable for banks or non-banking financial companies registered with the Reserve Bank of India. Provided further that the requirement of this sub-regulation shall not be applicable in case of unsecured debt instruments issued by regulated financial sector entities eligible for meeting capital requirements as specified by respective regulators.\\\\\\\\u201d  Regulation 52(5) \\\\\\\\u201cThe listed entity shall within seven working days from the date of submission of the information required under sub-regulation (4), submit to stock exchange(s), a certificate signed by debenture trustee that it has taken note of the contents\\\\\\\\u201d Prior to May 07, 2019, the aforesaid sub-regulation 5 of Regulation 52 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 read as \\\\\\\\u201cWhile submitting the information required under sub-regulation (4), the listed entity shall submit to stock exchange(s), a certificate signed by debenture trustee that it has taken note of the contents\\\\\\\\u201d.  FINDINGS  10. The first issue for consideration is whether the Noticee has violated Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of the LODR Regulations.  11. It may be noted that Regulation 52(1) of LODR Regulations provides for submission of the financial results within forty-five days from the end of the half year. Further, Regulation 52(4) provides for disclosure of certain line items along with the half yearly / annual financial Adjudication Order in respect of Ind Barath Thermotek Pvt. Ltd.                                                                         Page 7 of 10        results, while Regulation 52(5) provides for submission of a Certificate signed by the Debenture Trustee taking note of the contents prescribed under Regulation 52(4). 12. From the fact of the case, I observe that in pursuance of the reference of Vistra, SEBI sought information from Exchanges (NSE and BSE) regarding the compliance status of the Noticee with respect to Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations for the half year ended March 31, 2019. From the submissions of the BSE vide its emails dated October 07, 2019 and March 11, 2020, it was observed that the company has not complied with provisions of Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations.  13. Further, from the submissions of the Noticee, I note that the Noticee had not contended the fact that it had failed to make the aforesaid disclosures on time and hence the Noitcee had not denied the fact that it has violated the provisions of Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations.  14. Based on the aforesaid findings, I conclude that the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulations 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations.  15.  I further note that Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India, in the matter of Chairman, SEBI vs. Shriram Mutual Fund {[2006] 5 SCC 361} held that \"In our view, the penalty is attracted as soon as contravention of the statutory obligations as contemplated by the Act is established and, therefore, the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes immaterial. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. Hence, we are of the view that once the contravention is established, then the penalty has to follow and only the quantum of penalty is discretionary\\\\\\\\u201d.   16. In view of the foregoing, I am convinced that the Noticee is thus liable for monetary penalty under Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act for violation of Regulations 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of the LODR Regulations. The provisions of Section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read as under:  SEBI Act 15A - \\\\\\\\u201cPenalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. \\\\\\\\u2013 Adjudication Order in respect of Ind Barath Thermotek Pvt. Ltd.                                                                         Page 8 of 10        If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or Regulations made there under-  (a) \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026  (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the Regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the Regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less\\\\\\\\u201d.  17. While determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, it is important to consider the factors relevantly as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under:- Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer. Section 15J - While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:- (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default. Explanation. \\\\\\\\u2014For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E, clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.  18. The material available on record has not quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, if any, made by the Noticee and the loss, if any, suffered by the investors as a result of the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s failure. I also note that no prior default of the Noticee is available on record. However, the facts of the case clearly bring out the default made by the Noticee. I note that the Noticee had failed to make timely disclosures and thereby has violated Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of the LODR Regulations.

In view of the above, after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and the factors mentioned in the provisions of Section 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 5 of Rules, I hereby impose a penalty of Rs 3,00,000/- (Rupees Three lacs only) on the Noticee viz.  Ind Barath Thermotek Pvt. Ltd. in terms of the provisions of Section 15A(b) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. In the facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the view that the said penalty is commensurate with the default committed by the Noticee.  20. The Noticees shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR through online payment facility available on the website of SEBI, i.e. www.sebi.gov.in on the following path, by clicking on the payment link: ENFORCEMENT \\\\\\\\uf0e0 Orders \\\\\\\\uf0e0 Orders of AO \\\\\\\\uf0e0 PAY NOW.  21.

It was also revealed during the investigation that certain entities which were directly/indirectly connected with HPC had funded few of the IPO applicants so as to enable them to make applications under the IPO of the Company. The connection between those entities is based on factors like fund movements, common directorships Order in the matter of IPO of HPC Biosciences Limited Page 4 of 43   in companies etc. For the sake of reference, the said entities are hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cfunding group entities\\\\\\\\u201d.    vii.

Further, in the market maker category, the application for 2,32,000 shares were allegedly funded by the funding group entities.

Thus, based on the aforesaid details, the SCN alleges that the Company and its Directors had devised and planted a scheme with the help of the funding group entities to achieve the threshold of minimum applications (90% of the offer size) required for listing of its scrip on the SME segment of BSE, as has been envisaged under Regulation 14(1) of SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirement) Regulations, 2009, (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cICDR Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). As the Company and  its connected entities (other  Noticees) had allegedly acted in concert to fund to the tune of  29.03% of the total allotted shares, the achievement of compliance with Regulation 14(1) of the ICDR Regulations was allegedly done under a fraudulent scheme, under which certain funds from the IPO proceeds were transferred to a few of the funding group entities post-IPO against the funding made by the to the IPO applicants  and the  said act of devising  a scheme to ensure listing of securities with the help of the funding group entities has been alleged to be in violation of Sections 12A(a), (b) and (c) of Securities and Exchange Board of India  Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) read with Regulation 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and 4(1) of SEBI (Prohibition of Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d).  4. It is noted that the SCN was served on the Noticee nos. 1 to 4, 7 and 9 through SPAD and upon the rest of the Noticees, the SCN was served through affixture at their respective last known addresses. I note from the records that the Noticee nos. 2, 3, and 7 had sought inspection of the documents which was provided to them on September 23, 2019.  5. The Noticees were provided with opportunity to make submission in their defense through personal hearing before me that was fixed on June 18, 2019 which was subsequently rescheduled to July 16, 2019.  It is noted that on July 16, 2019 no one appeared on behalf of the Order in the matter of IPO of HPC Biosciences Limited Page 9 of 43   Noticees hence, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticees on November 14, 2019. On the said date, only Noticee no. 2 appeared before me and he also represented on behalf of Noticee no. 1 and 3 however, no one appeared on behalf of the other Noticees. The details of the service of hearing notices which were served to the Noticees for hearing held on November 14, 2019 are as under:  Table no. 6 Noticee no.

It is noted from the materials available on record that none of the Noticees except for Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 3, has filed any reply to the SCN and also except for these three Noticees, none of the other Noticees has availed the opportunity of personal hearing before me.   7. It is noted from the records that the Noticee nos. 2, 3 and 7 have through their various letters, have sought copy of investigation report and all other material collected by SEBI during the investigation and to support their request for such documents, reliance has been placed on Order in the matter of IPO of HPC Biosciences Limited Page 10 of 43   the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI Vs. Price Waterhouse (Civil Appeal no. 6003-6004/2012). Further, vide common letter dated November 20, 2019, Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 3 have filed a written submission. Also, vide letter dated March 03, 2020, an additional submission has been filed by the Noticee no.1. The highlights of aforesaid submissions made by the above noted three Noticees (i.e. Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 3) are as under:  i. The IPO of CNE was 100% underwritten in compliance with the Regulation 106P of SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cICDR Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) and therefore the allegation that the Company was involved in getting its shares subscribed by acting in undesirable manner is not sustainable. Copy of the underwriting agreement has also been filed in support of the said submission.  ii. The financial dealings of the Company with the Goldline International Finvest Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cGoldline\\\\\\\\u201d) and other entities were purely commercial in nature. Goldline is in the business of buying & selling of shares and lending and borrowing. Further based on the financial transactions carried out between other entities, no adverse inference should be drawn against the Noticee Company, i.e., HPC.  iii. The Company came out with its IPO to raise INR 15.96 Crore by way of pubic issue and its securities got listed on BSE-SME segment w.e.f. March 19, 2013. For the purposes of IPO, the Company appointed Lead Manager (Guiness Corporate Advisors Pvt. Ltd.) and Registrar to the Issue (Cameo Corporate Services Ltd.) to carry out all legal procedure and compliances for the purpose of IPO. The said entities as well as BSE have advised and ensured due compliances of extant regulations for the purpose of IPO.  iv. Cooperation has been extended by providing relevant documents during the investigation and perusal of the SCN does not reflect that the investigation was hampered due to lack of information or remained incomplete for the reasons attributable to the Company. Rather, the SCN reflects that SEBI was able to conclude its investigation and the instant SCN was issued after conclusion of the investigation. v. Vide order dated September 06, 2017, proceedings against 110 entities were disposed of who were initially prima facie charged in the interim order including entities having alleged Order in the matter of IPO of HPC Biosciences Limited Page 11 of 43   association with the Company. The same shows that SEBI has not found any obnoxious irregularity pertaining to price rise and allocations in the IPO of the Company. vi. The provisions of Section 12 A (a), (b) and (c) of SEBI Act, 1992, and Regulation 3 and 4 of PFUTP Regulations are not attracted, as they have not dealt in securities, i.e., activity in the secondary market segment of capital market. vii. During investigation, only selected financial transactions have been picked up and the transactions executed by third parties have been made basis to make allegations, without appreciating business model of such companies. The matter requires re-investigation to appreciate the true facts based on the comprehensive investigation as has been done in various other matters.  viii. In terms of the stated Objects of the IPO, the Company has entered into agreements with various entities for development of farm land for transition into organic farming. The Company has provided copy of agreements, invoices, ledger etc., pertaining to the agreements entered with 7 different proprietorship firms for a total amount of INR 8.99 Crore.  ix. The Company had also made certain expenses towards IPO itself which includes INR 2.35 Lakh to BSE; INR 2.60 Lakh to SAP Printer Solutions Pvt. Ltd.; INR 18.09 Lakh to Guiness Corporate Advisor (Manager to the Issue); INR 1.88 Lakh to NSDL and CDSL; and INR 1.30 Lakh to Innovative Communication (for newspaper advertisement). The Company has also incurred expenses of around INR 2.20 Lakh towards miscellaneous heads like travelling expenses (INR 1.75 Lakh); brokerage to IPO banks (INR 25,956) and market making expenses (INR 20,000). For the said expenses, the Company has given copy of its internal ledger. Consideration of Issues and findings  8. Before adverting to the merits of the case, I deem it fit to first deal with the technical ground raised by certain Noticees. It is noted that few of the Noticees have made a request to provide all the documents collected during investigation, copy of investigation report etc. At the outset, I observe that the Noticees have made a very generic request seeking all the documents pertaining to the present proceedings. Insofar as the copy of investigation report and alleged non-compliance of principles of natural justice is concerned, I refer to the observations made Order in the matter of IPO of HPC Biosciences Limited Page 12 of 43   by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the case of Reliance Commodities Ltd Vs. National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Ltd. (Date of decision: July 23, 2019). The relevant portion of the said observations are reproduced hereunder:  \\\\\\\\u201c2. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having perused the list of documents so required for inspection we are of the opinion that the documents sought for is nothing but a roving and fishing enquiry. We accordingly do not find any merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that these documents are essential for the purpose of filing an appropriate reply. 3. However, we are of the opinion that if any document is relied by the respondent while disposing of the matter such document should be made available to the appellant\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d  9. Further, similar observations have also been made by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Shruti Vora Vs. SEBI (Date of decision: February 12, 2020). In the said matter, the appellant therein had challenged the rejection of her request to inspect all the documents collected during the investigation. While rejecting the said challenge, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT inter alia held: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026A bare reading of the provisions of the Act and the Rules as referred to above do not provide supply of documents upon which no reliance has been placed by the AO, nor even the principles of natural justice require supply of such documents which has not been relied upon by the AO.\\\\\\\\u201d (emphasis supplied). Therefore, applying the ratio of the aforesaid orders in the present case, I observe that the demand of the Noticees to provide them with the copy of investigation report and other material collected during the investigation is devoid of merit and is thus rejected. 10. Moving on further, it is noted from the records that despite providing sufficient opportunity, the Noticee nos. 4 to 11 have failed to present their case before me, as they have neither filed any reply to the SCN nor appeared before me for the personal hearing. I also note that adequate opportunities have been provided to them to present their case rebutting the allegations made in the SCN, however, for the reasons best known to them, they have preferred to remain absent and silent. I am of the view that sufficient opportunities have been granted to them and therefore, it would be appropriate to proceeds with matter on its merit, based on material available on record.   11. I have carefully perused the SCN, its annexure, submissions made by the Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 3 and other materials available on the records. From a perusal of the charges made in the SCN, it is viewed that the following issues emerge for consideration in the present matter: Order in the matter of IPO of HPC Biosciences Limited Page 13 of 43   Issue I: Whether the Noticee nos. 4 to 11 are connected and whether the Company through its connected entities/Noticees has funded the subscription of its IPO? Issue II: Whether the proceeds of IPO have been utilized by the Company in terms of the Objects stated in the Prospectus? 12. Before I proceed to examine whether the material available on record is sufficient to find out the answers to the aforesaid issues, it would be appropriate to refer and reproduce the relevant provisions of the law that have been alleged to have been violated by the Noticees in the SCN or are relevant for to the present matter:  SEBI Act, 1992  Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control Section 12A.No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  (b)employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange;  (c)engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder. SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003 Prohibition of certain dealings in securities Regulation 3.

Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices  Regulation 4 (1)  Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities. SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 Minimum Subscription 14. (1) the minimum subscription to be received in an issue shall not be less than ninety percent of the offer through offer document: Provided that in the case of an initial public offer, the minimum subscription to be received shall be subject to allotment of minimum number of specified securities, as prescribed in sub-clause (b) of clause (2) of rule 19 of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957. 13. Insofar as the connection amongst the Noticees is concerned, I note that such an allegation is largely premised on the inter-se fund transactions between various parties and in a few cases, the connections are based on other parameters like common directorship, common address etc. The said details of connections that were found amongst various entities, as noted from the SCN are reproduced hereunder: Order in the matter of IPO of HPC Biosciences Limited Page 15 of 43   Table no. 7 Sr. No. Particulars Connection - Fund Movement 1.

As the Company and its connected entities had allegedly acted in concert to fund to the tune of 51.66% of the total allotted shares, the achievement of compliance with Regulation 14(1) of the ICDR Regulations was allegedly done under a fraudulent scheme, under which certain funds from the IPO proceeds were transferred to few of the funding group entities post-IPO  (apparently to compensate them for the funding of IPO applications done by them) The Order in the matter of Esteem Bio Organic Food Processing Limited                     Page 8 of 45   said act of devising such a scheme to ensure listing of securities with the help of the funding group entities has been alleged to be in violation of Sections 12A(a), (b) and (c) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) read with Regulation 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and 4(1) of SEBI (Prohibition of Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d).  5. I note that the SCN was served on Noticee nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13 through SPAD and Notice nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14 and 15, through affixation. It is noted that the Noticee nos. 1, 3, 4, 10 and 15 had sought inspection of the documents which was granted to them. Later on, opportunity of personal hearing to the Noticees was granted on June 18, 2019 which was rescheduled to July 02, 2019. However, as inspection of documents was sought by few more Noticees, the personal hearing was again rescheduled to August 06, 2019. It is noted from the records that the hearing notice was served upon on various Noticees through substituted mode of service, viz., Newspaper publication, with the following details:  Table 6  Sr. No. Name of the Noticee  Hearing on 06.08.2019  4 Goldline International Finvest Ltd.

On the said date, i.e., August 06, 2019, only Noticee no. 13 appeared through authorized representative and he was heard, while adjournment requests were received from Noticee nos. 1, 3, 4, 10 and 15 Accordingly, the Noticee no. 1, 3, 4 10 and 15 were provided with another opportunity of personal hearing on November 14, 2019. On the said date only, Noticee no. 3 appeared on his behalf as well as on behalf of the Company (Noticee no.1) also and inter alia informed that Noticee no. 2 has expired.   7. The Company i.e. Noticee no. 1, vide its letter dated October 06, 2017 and Noticee no. 3 vide his letter dated June 13, 2019, have sought copy of the entire investigation report and all other material collected by SEBI during the investigation and to support their request for such documents, reliance has been placed by them on the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI Vs. Price Waterhouse (Civil Appeal no. 6003-6004/2012). Further, vide letter dated November 25, 2019, Noticee no. 1 and 3 have filed a written reply to the SCN and also vide letter dated March 09, 2020, a post hearing written submission has been filed by them. The following key submissions have been made in the said letters:  i. In compliance with the Regulation 106P of SEBI ICDR Regulations, 2009, the IPO of Esteem Bio was 100% underwritten. The said fact reflects that the charges of arranging funds for subscription to the IPO cannot be sustained. In support, the copy of the underwriting agreement has been filed.  ii. The transactions with various entities including Noticee no. 4 (Goldline International Finvest Ltd.) which have formed the basis of allegations in the SCN, were in commercial nature. The Company has no control on the transactions executed by other entities. Noticee no. 4 is having business dealing in securities and corporate loans etc.  iii. The IPO of the Company was launched in compliance with the applicable laws. Guiness Corporate Advisors Pvt. Ltd. was appointed as Lead Manager and Cameo Corporate Services Ltd. was appointed as the RTA.   iv. The SCN has been issued after 4 years of the closure of the issue and due to the said delay, the charges should be dropped.  v. There is no finding in the SCN to the effect that investigation conducted by SEBI was hampered due to lack of information. For certain other entities, proceedings initiated by passing of interim orders have been dropped by SEBI.  vi. The charges of violating Section 12 A(a), (b), (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and 4(1) of PFUTP Regulations are not made out as no Order in the matter of Esteem Bio Organic Food Processing Limited                     Page 10 of 45   transaction in securities in the secondary market segment of capital market has been done. vii. The investigation conducted by SEBI has picked up selected financial transactions and financial transactions of third parties like Goldline have formed basis of making allegations. The case deserves re-investigation for appreciation of correct facts, as has been done in certain other cases.  viii. IPO proceeds were utilized towards the stated objects and land development agreements for an amount of INR 5.66 Crore have been executed by the Company.  ix. Apart from the above, the Company had spent INR 29.00 Lakh (approx.) towards expenses of IPO.  The details of the said amount spent are: INR 2.66 (approx.) Lakh to BSE; INR 2.88 Lakh to SAP Printer Solutions Pvt. Ltd.; INR 20.00 Lakh (approx.) to Guiness Corporate Advisor (Merchant Banker); INR 1.23 Lakh to NSDL and CDSL; and INR 1.24 Lakh (approx.) to Innovative Communication. Also, INR 58.00 Lakh has been paid to Cameo Corporate Services.  x. The Company has also extended an amount of INR 4.40 Crore in short term loans to various entities. 8. Noticee no. 10 (Avisha Credit Capital Limited), vide its letter dated September 11, 2017, while denying the allegations, has submitted that it is a Non- Banking Financial Company (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Avisha\\\\\\\\u2019) and in its normal course of business, it had provided funds to needy people, who in turn have discretion to utilize such funds as per their requirement. The Noticee no. 10, vide its letter dated June 12, 2019, has sought copy of entire investigation report, all other material collected by SEBI during the course of investigation, and also has sought cross examination of persons whose statement were recorded by SEBI during the investigation. Further, vide letter dated July 29, 2019, the Noticee no. 10 sought time to file additional reply and has also sought certain documents. The said documents were already provided to the Noticee vide SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s letter dated July 25, 2019, however, so far no further reply has been filed by the Noticee no. 10. 9. Noticee no. 13 (Ace Consultants) vide its written reply dated October 03, 2017 and through a post-hearing written submission vide letter dated August 19, 2019 has advanced the following submissions:  i. Ms. Sunita Khemka the proprietor of the Noticee firm has association in the field of financial and capital market as consultant for over 25 years and has been dealing regularly in securities. Order in the matter of Esteem Bio Organic Food Processing Limited                     Page 11 of 45   ii. Ms. Sunita was a Designated Director in SEBI registered Stock Broker ISF Securities Ltd (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cISF\\\\\\\\u201d) and she, along with her husband hold 51% stake in ISF Securities Ltd. The stake in ISF was purchased in January 2012 (46.87%) and January 2014 (4.13%). The appointment as Designated Directors and Dominant Promoters of ISF has been done with the approval of BSE and NSE.  iii. The SCN has alleged connection based on directorship of Noticee no. 3 (Brij Kishore Sabharwal) in ISF. Noticee no. 3 was Director of ISF before ISF was acquired by Ms. Sunita and her husband. However, in order to maintain existing retail clients of ISF, Noticee no. 3 continued to be a Director of ISF even after change in control and Noticee no. 3 resigned from the directorship of ISF on March 21, 2014. The relationship with the Noticee no. 3 was purely professional.  iv. The SCN alleges that Noticee no. 13 (Ace Consultants) being a funding group entity has funded Ms. Sunita Khemka for subscription to the IPO of the Company. The said allegation is baseless as Ms. Sunita herself is the proprietor as well as signatory of the bank account of Noticee no. 13 and being a proprietorship firm, Noticee no. 13 could not have applied for the shares under the IPO.  v. The application under IPO was only for 6000 shares for a small amount of INR 1.50 Lakh, which cannot be said to have made under instructions of anyone else, particularly in the absence of any evidence.  vi. Ms. Sunita had also applied under the IPO of another company viz., Eco Friendly Food Processing Park Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cECO\\\\\\\\u201d). The said application in the IPO was rejected and the refund amount of INR 1.50 Lakh was utilized towards application of IPO of Esteem Bio.  vii. In ECO also, Noticee no. 3 (Brij Kishore Sabharwal), is one of the Directors. As her application for shares of ECO was rejected, the same shows that Ms. Sunita does not have any connection (except professional) with the Noticee no. 3.  viii. There is no direct connection with Noticee no. 4 (Goldline International Finvest Ltd.). It has taken loan of INR 50.00 Lakh from Noticee no. 4, which was a RBI registered NBFC, during FY 2012-13. The said loan has been repaid during FY 2014-15 with interest of INR 5.81 Lakh (approx.).  ix. There is no allegation of receipt of IPO proceeds by Ace Consultants.  x. For an act to be termed as \\\\\\\\u2018fraudulent\\\\\\\\u2019, inducement or misrepresentation needs to be present, as held by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of Ram Chandra Singh Vs. Savitri Devi and Ors. [2003 8 SCC 319]. By the investment of INR 1.50 Lakh, there is Order in the matter of Esteem Bio Organic Food Processing Limited                     Page 12 of 45   no inducement caused to anyone nor any false statement has been alleged to be made. xi. Similarly, to prove an act to be manipulative, a mere single act is not sufficient and series of acts reflecting the manipulative intent is required, as has been held by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. Vs. SEBI. xii. The evidence to prove the allegation of \\\\\\\\u2018fraud\\\\\\\\u2019 requires stronger evidence as has been observed by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of Bank of India Vs. Degala Surya Narayan (AIR 1999 SC 2407) 10. Noticee no. 15 (Gracious Software Limited), vide its letter dated June 12, 2019, has made identical requests for copies of documents, as have been made by other Noticees. Further, vide letter dated July 29, 2019, the Noticee no. 15 sought time to file written reply to the SCN, however, so far, no reply has been filed by the Noticee no. 15.  Consideration of Issues and findings 11. Before addressing the contentions raised on merits of the case by various Noticees, I observe that a technical ground raised by certain Noticees needs consideration first. It is noted that few of the Noticees have made a request to provide all the documents collected during investigation and a copy of the entire investigation report etc. At the outset, it is observed that the Noticees have made a very generic request seeking all the documents pertaining to the present proceedings without specifying as to which document they need to defend their case on merit. Insofar as the copy of investigation report and alleged non-compliance of principles of natural justice is concerned, I refer to the observations made by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the case of Reliance Commodities Ltd Vs. National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Ltd. (Date of decision: July 23, 2019). The relevant portion of the said observations are under:  \\\\\\\\u201c2. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having perused the list of documents so required for inspection we are of the opinion that the documents sought for is nothing but a roving and fishing enquiry. We accordingly do not find any merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that these documents are essential for the purpose of filing an appropriate reply. 3. However, we are of the opinion that if any document is relied by the respondent while disposing of the matter such document should be made available to the appellant\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d  12. Similar observations have also been made by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Shruti Vora Vs. SEBI (Date of decision: February 12, 2020). In the said matter, the appellant therein had challenged the rejection of her request to inspect all the documents collected during the Order in the matter of Esteem Bio Organic Food Processing Limited                     Page 13 of 45   investigation. While rejecting the said challenge, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT inter alia held : \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026A bare reading of the provisions of the Act and the Rules as referred to above do not provide supply of documents upon which no reliance has been placed by the AO, nor even the principles of natural justice require supply of such documents which has not been relied upon by the AO.\\\\\\\\u201d (emphasis supplied). Therefore, applying the ratio of the aforesaid orders in the present case, I observe that the demand of the Noticees to provide them with the copy of investigation report and other material collected during the investigation is devoid of merit and has to be rejected since in the extant case, all the documents that have been relied upon in the SCN to make the allegations against the Noticees have already been furnished to them along with the SCN itself. Moreover, as per the materials before me, no statement of any person has been recorded during the investigation, hence, the question of providing a copy of any statement does not arise.  I find the SCN containing all the findings of Investigation relevant to the Noticees based on which the allegation have been made therein and in support of those allegations all the relevant facts and documents have already been conveyed to the Noticees through the SCN and its Annexures.  Therefore, the demand of the Noticees for a copy of Investigation Report and all documents etc., are found to sans any merit, hence rejected. 13. Moving on further, it is observed that adequate opportunities of personal hearing have been provided to all the Noticees, however, the Noticee nos. 4 to 9, 11, 12, 14 and 15 have neither filed any reply to the charges made in the SCN nor have availed the opportunities of personal hearing granted to them. I am therefore, of the view that as the said Noticees have chosen not to respond to the SCN, it would be appropriate to proceed in the matter, based on materials available on record.   14. I have carefully perused the SCN along with its annexure as well as the submissions made by the various Noticees. Based on these the records and submissions, I observe that in order to adjudge the charges levelled against the Noticees in the SCN, the following issues needs to be addressed:  Issue I: Whether the Noticee nos. 4 to 15 enjoy connection with the Company and the Company through its connected entities/Noticees devised a scheme to ensure the successful subscription of its IPO?  Issue II: Whether the proceeds of IPO have been utilized by the Company in terms of the Objects stated in the Prospectus? 15. Before adverting to the specific facts of the case, it is deemed appropriate to first refer to the provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 and regulations, which have been either alleged to be violated Order in the matter of Esteem Bio Organic Food Processing Limited                     Page 14 of 45   by the Noticees or are otherwise relevant for the present proceedings. The said provisions are reproduced hereunder for ready reference:  SEBI Act, 1992  Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control Section 12A.No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  (b)employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange;  (c)engage in any act, practice, course of business which opera", "Date": "2020-12-22", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "In the matter of Esteem Bio Organic Food Processing Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/dec-2020/in-the-matter-of-esteem-bio-organic-food-processing-limited_48537.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 58134, "unique_record_id": "ca915dec25SEBI20201222", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "66809fab7858910306471728", "parse_date": "2024-06-29 23:58:03", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "INR 11.25 Crore", "gpt_audience": "- Investors and shareholders of Esteem Bio Organic Food Processing Limited\n- Regulatory authorities such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\n- Legal professionals and compliance officers\n- Financial analysts and market researchers\n- Company management and board members of Esteem Bio Organic Food Processing Limited\n- Potential investors considering investment in Esteem Bio Organic Food Processing Limited\n- Media and financial journalists\n- Auditors and accounting professionals", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 3. Vide communication order dated July 23, 2020, the undersigned has been appointed as Adjudicating Officer in the matter under Section 15 I (1) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) to  inquire and adjudge the alleged violations by Global Securities Limited (Noticee) and if satisfied that the Noticee is liable for imposition of penalty, may impose such penalty in terms of rule 5 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and imposing penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred as \\\\\\\\u2018AO Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) under the provisions of Section 23E of SCRA, 1956.

Subsequently, a show Cause Notice (SCN) was issued to the Noticee on November 06, 2020, vide which the Noticee was clearly advised to submit its reply within fourteen days of receipt of the same. The same was returned undelivered with remarks \\\\\\\\u201caddressee left without instructions\\\\\\\\u201d. In the meantime scanned copy of the SCN was also sent to the Noticee vide e-mail dated November 12, 2020 along with the requisite Annexures at the e-mail ID globalsecurities123@gmails.com, which was available on record. However, no reply was received from the Noticee till the passing of this order.  5. Subsequently, vide e-mail dated November 25, 2020, hearing Notice dated November 25, 2020 was digitally sent to the Noticee at the e-mail ID globalsecurities123@gmails.com, vide which the Noticee was granted opportunity of virtual hearing through webex on December 16, 2020.

This leads to unnecessary and avoidable loss of time and resources on part of all concerned and should be eschewed, to say the least. Hence, this case is being decided on basis of material before this Tribunal\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  Keeping the aforesaid in mind, the adjudication proceedings against the Noticee are undertaken ex-parte on the basis of material available on record.

Further, from the financial results of GSL for the FY ended 2013, 2014 and 2015 following observations were made; Description Year ended (Rs. in million) 31-March-2011 31-March-2012 31-March-2013 31-March-2014 Revenue 38.26 1.20 Details not available on BSE website. Expenditure -36.28 -1.14 Net Profit 1.97 0.02  13. On perusal of the shareholding pattern of the promoters available on the BSE website during the IP, following observations are made; \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is observed that Global Securities Ltd. i.e. Noticee has not filed its shareholding pattern for June 2013 and September 2013 quarter on BSE. Subsequently, vide email dated December 20, 2019, BSE has informed that the company has not submitted shareholding Pattern for quarter ended June 2013 and September 2013 to the Exchange.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Thus, the company has failed to file quarterly shareholding pattern for June 2013 and September 2013 quarters as required under Clause 35 of the Listing Agreement r/w Regulation 103 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and section 21 of the SCRA, 1956.  14. Therefore, in view of the foregoing, it is observed that the Noticee has failed to file quarterly shareholding pattern for June 2013 and September 2013 quarters as required under Clause 35 of the Listing Agreement r/w Regulation 103 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and section 21 of the SCRA, 1956.   15. I find that the Noticee is a listed company and was under an obligation in terms of section 21 of SCRA to comply with the conditions of Listing Agreement. Specifically, Clause 35 of Listing Agreement mandates the listed companies to file inter alia its shareholding pattern including the shareholding of its promoters, with the exchanges on a quarterly basis. Needless to say, the Noticee was required to make true and correct disclosure regarding shareholding pattern. Periodic disclosures under Clause 35 of the listing agreement serve a very important purpose of informing the market and the investors about the shareholding of the company i.e. names and holdings of the promoters and significant shareholders   16. The shareholding and names of promoters and significant shareholders form a very important criterion for the public to make their investment decisions. Hence, I find that the Noticee has, by not making requisite Adjudication Order in respect of Global Securities Limited                                   Page 6 of 8  disclosures of the shareholding of its promoters, violated provisions of section 21 of SCRA read with 35 of the Equity Listing Agreement.  17. It is also pertinent to draw attention towards the matter of Coimbatore Flavors & Fragrances Ltd. vs SEBI (Appeal No. 209 of 2014 order dated August 11, 2014), wherein Hon'ble SAT observed that \\\\\\\\u201cUndoubtedly, the purpose of these disclosures is to bring about more transparency in the affairs of the companies. True and timely disclosures by a company or its promoters are very essential from two angles. Firstly; investors can take a more informed decision to invest or not to invest in a particular scrip secondly; the Regulator can properly monitor the transactions in the capital market to effectively regulate the same.\"  Issue No. II: Does the violation, if any, on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under Section 23E of SCRA, 1956?  18. Referring to the judgment in the matter of SEBI vs. Shriram Ram Mutual Fund 2006 SCL 216(SC), wherein Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court held that; \\\\\\\\u201cIn our opinion, mens rea is not an essential ingredient for contravention of the provisions of a civil act. In our view, the penalty is attracted as soon as contravention of the statutory obligations as contemplated by the Act is established and, therefore, the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes immaterial. In other words, the breach of a civil obligation which attracts penalty under the provisions of an Act would immediately attract the levy of penalty irrespective of the fact whether the contravention was made by the defaulter with any guilty intention or not. We also further held that unless the language of the statute indicates the need to establish the presence of mens rea, it is wholly unnecessary to ascertain whether such a violation was intentional or not\\\\\\\\u201d  19.  In view of the foregoing, it is concluded that the Noticee has violated the provisions of Clause 35 of the Listing Agreement r/w Regulation 103 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and section 21 of the SCRA, 1956. Therefore, it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under the provisions of section 23E of SCRA, which reads as under:   Penalty for failure to comply with provision of listing conditions or delisting conditions or grounds. 23E. If a company or any person managing collective investment scheme or mutual fund fails to comply with the listing conditions or delisting conditions or grounds or commits a breach thereof, it or he shall be \"liable to a penalty not exceeding twenty-five crore rupees\\\\\\\\u201d (as existed before the September 08, 2014 amendment). Adjudication Order in respect of Global Securities Limited                                   Page 7 of 8  Issue No. III: If so, what would be the quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee after taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act?  20.  In this regard, while determining the quantum of penalty, it is important to consider the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act, which reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201c15J - Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer  While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely: -  (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default;  (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  Explanation: For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E,clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F,15G,15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.\\\\\\\\u201d  21. In the instant matter it is not possible to quantify the gains made by the Noticee or the loss caused to investors as a result of the non-disclosures by the Noticee. The Noticee, by its failure to make disclosures, have severely impaired the integrity of the disclosure system put in place by the regulator and has deprived the investors of the significant information at the relevant time. Hence its actions warrant the imposition of penalty. I also find that the Noticee has not filed requisite disclosures for two (2) consecutive quarters and thus, the default on the part of the Noticee is repetitive in nature. ORDER 22. After taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case and factors enumerated in section 15J of the SEBI Act, an appropriate penalty for the non-disclosure by the Noticee for alleged violation (as enumerated in preceding paras above), in exercise of powers conferred under section 15I of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 5 of the SEBI Adjudication Rules, is imposed on the Noticees, under Section 23E of SCRA, 1956, for the alleged violations of non-disclosure. The Noticee will be liable to pay the penalty amount as mentioned in the table below;  Name of the Noticee Penalty Amount (in Rs.)

Order/BD/AB/2020-21/9858] UNDER SECTION 15-I OF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA ACT, 1992 READ WITH RULE 5 OF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA (PROCEDURE FOR HOLDING INQUIRY AND IMPOSING PENALTIES) RULES, 1995   In respect of:  M/s Rikhav Investments   FACTS OF THE CASE: 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) conducted investigation into the initial public offer of Birla Pacific Medspa Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBPML\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cthe Company\\\\\\\\u201d), for the period from July 7, 2011 to July 15, 2011 (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d), since there was high volatility on the day of listing.  2. Based on the findings of the investigation, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings against Rikhav Investments (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) under Section 15HA of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d), for the alleged violation of Violation of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (g) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter be referred to as \"PFUTP Regulations\").  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 3. SEBI appointed the Shri D. Sura Reddy as the Adjudicating Officer under section 15 I of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (\\\\\\\\u201cAO Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge the aforesaid allegations under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act on March 10, 2017. Subsequently, Shri Jeevan Sonaparote wasPage 2 of 7  appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter after which the undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter on September 26, 2019.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 4. A Show Cause Notice dated April 20, 2017 (hereinafter be referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to the Noticee under Rule 4 of the AO Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated and penalty be not imposed under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act for the allegations as detailed in the said SCN.  5. The scrip of BPML was listed on BSE on July 7, 2011, after IPO which was open for subscription from June 20, 2011- June 23, 2011. It was observed that the Noticee had entered into self-trades for 10,483 shares during the Investigation Period on 5 days and having a net LTP contribution of Rs. 0.15. Hence it was alleged that the Noticee manipulated the scrip of BPML and violated regulations 3 (a),(b),(c) and (d), 4 (1), 4 (2) (a) and (g) of the PFUTP Regulations. 6. The Noticee vide letter dated May 5, 2017 sought inspection of certain documents but when letter granting inspection returned undelivered. The Noticee sent a reminder for seeking inspection from a new address through a letter dated July 13, 2017. The Noticee was granted an opportunity of inspection vide letter dated July 20, 2017. The Noticee submitted its reply vide letter dated August 4, 2017.  7. A summary of the submissions made by the Noticee are as under: a. The self-trades in the scrip of BPML were unintentional, non-manipulative and were a result of bonafide intra-day/jobbing activity. b. The turnover of the Noticee during 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12 was Rs. 527.61 crores, Rs. 49,215 crores and Rs. 30,454 crores. The scripwise dealing of the Noticee in 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12 was 330 scrips, 1359 scrips and 559 scrips respectively. This shows that the Noticee was in the business of trading/jobbing in various scrips.  c. The contribution of the Noticee as regards total volume in the scrip of BPML was very insignificant and not more than 0.02% on any day. InPage 3 of 7  terms of trade count the trade count of the Noticee was not more than 0.08% on any day. d. The Noticee submitted that mere occurrence of self trades is not per-se manipulative or fraudulent. The insignificant volume of trading of the Noticee could not have impacted the price or the volume of the BPML scrip. e. The Notice relied on the judgments of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of SPJ Stock Brokers Pvt. Ltd., Kapil Chaturabhij Bhuptni, BP Fintrade Pvt. Ltd. and Krupa Sanjay Soni in support of its submissions. The Noticee also cited SEBI AO orders in the matters of Ajay Desai and Indira Securities Pvt. Ltd., JMP Securities Pvt. Ltd. and various other orders in support of its submissions.  8. Since the undersigned was appointed as AO subsequently, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on November 13, 2020 through email dated November 4, 2020. The hearing was rescheduled to November 25, 2020 which was attended by the representative of the Noticee. During the hearing the Noticee reiterated the submissions made earlier.   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES 9. I have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticee, its reply and the documents / material available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are : (a) Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2) (a) and (g) of PFUTP Regulations? (b) If yes, then do the violations, if any, on the part of the Noticee attract any monetary penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act?  (c) If yes, then what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticee, taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5(2) of the Rules?   10. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the PFUTP Regulations which at the relevant time read as under:Page 4 of 7  PFUTP Regulations 3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities  No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014  (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner;  (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under;  (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange;  (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.   4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices   (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities.  (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following, namely:\\\\\\\\u2014  (a) indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market;  (b) \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.  (c) \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.  (d) \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.  (e) \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..  (f) \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..  (g) entering into a transaction in securities without intention of performing it or without intention of change of ownership of such security  11. The first issue to be decided is whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2) (a) and (g) of PFUTP Regulations?Page 5 of 7  12. Upon perusal of the reply of the Noticee and documents available on record, I find that it is not in dispute that 74 self-trades for 10,483 shares were executed by the Noticee in the scrip of BPML at BSE on five days.  13. I find that on BSE the total traded volume of BPML\\\\\\\\u2019s shares during the five days when Noticee traded was 16,29,55,469 shares and self-trades done by the Noticee for a total quantity of 10,483 shares through 74 trades constituted a total of 0.006% of the market volume in scrip of BPML.  14. The details of self-trades of the Noticee, during the investigation period as extracted from the trade log are as follows:    BSE Date Self-trades volume (No. of shares) Market Volume % of self-trades to market volume (no. of shares) 07/07/2011 7282 135859684 0.01 08/07/2011 1514 7936167 0.02 11/07/2011 1467 9547173 0.02 12/07/2011 13 7505035 0.0001 14/07/2011 207 2107410 0.009 Total 10,483 16,29,55,469 0.006  15. I also note that on all trading days when the Noticee has executed self-trades, the percentage of self-traded volume to total market volume traded on BSE is seemingly miniscule. In addition to that the percentage of self-trade volume of the Noticee to the total traded market volume was only 0.006% on BSE during the five days when these self-trades were executed. Therefore, I conclude that the percentage contribution as mentioned above does not suggest possibility of any manipulative intent to the extent of creating artificial volume in BPML during the period of investigation. 16. I note that volume transacted in self-trades is one of the important factors to determine the manipulative intention, if any, of a person on the issue of self-trades. If the self-trades of the Noticee are considered in that background, then it would be difficult to hold in the present matter that there was anyPage 6 of 7  manipulative intent on the part of the Noticee to engage in intentional self-trades as such percentage / volume of self-trades of the Noticee in the scrip of BPML was miniscule as compared to the total trading in the said scrip during the relevant period. 17. From aforesaid such negligible percentage in the scrip, it is difficult to arrive at the conclusion that these self-trades were executed by the Noticee with an intent to create misleading appearance of trading in the securities market. It is important to note here that the motive behind executing fraudulent self-trades can either be to artificially raise the volume in a scrip / or to manipulate the price of a scrip by way of creating misleading appearance of trading so as to induce others to deal in the particular scrip. I note that the Investigation Report, per se, has not brought out any allegation of price manipulation attributed to Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s self-trades. The net LTP contribution of the trading of the Noticee is Rs. 0.15 which is very insignificant to establish any manipulation. 18. I am in agreement with the precedents cited by the Noticee and as stated above the volume of self-trades done by the Noticee are very insignificant to conclusively establish any manipulation by the Noticee. After taking into account aforesaid observations, perusal of investigation report and taking into account, in particular, the miniscule percentage / volume of self-trades as compared to the total market volume during the investigation period, I am of the view that it is difficult to conclude that self-trades of Noticee in the scrip of BPML were intentional and manipulative and I am inclined to conclude that violations of provisions of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (g) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003 by the Noticee do not stand established. Since the alleged violations are not established against the Noticee, Issues No. (b) and (c) require no consideration.   ORDER 19. For the aforesaid reasons, Show Cause Notice dated December 12, 2017 alleging violations of provisions of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (g) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003 by the Noticee i.e. M/s RikhavPage 7 of 7  Investments, is disposed of without imposition of any penalty under Section of 15HA of SEBI Act.   20. In terms of rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

Hence, it is observed that entire transaction was not genuine and disclosure as appearing in the prospectus was wrong.Page 3 of 23  f) Equastone was a related entity of ATL / Ravikumar as wife of Ravikumar was the majority shareholder in Equastone and employees of ATL (viz. Prashanth Kumar and Madhava Reddy) were the directors in Equastone during 2010-11. The aforementioned transactions with Equastone, being a related party were not disclosed by ATL in its prospectus.  g) Further, from the MCA filing, it was observed that, Mrs. Malini Reddy (Malini) had transferred her entire shareholding to Shri Prashanth Kumar and Madhava Reddy who were employees of ATL itself and the filing with regard to change in shareholding pertaining to annual filing for the year 2007 with MCA was done only on July 25, 2011, (i.e well after the IPO). Hence, it was evident that Equastone was a related company of ATL / Ravikumar  h) Noticee had submitted Due diligence certificate w.r.t the IPO of ATL.   i) Noticee vide letter dated 24/06/2016 has submitted that, Mrs. Malini Reddy (Malini) had resigned as director in Equastone and transferred her entire share- holding in 2006 to \\\\\\\\u2018a third party\\\\\\\\u2019. Noticee was further asked to provide any evidence to substantiate its claim that \\\\\\\\u201cMrs. Malini Reddy had transferred her entire holding in 2006\\\\\\\\u201d and also to provide details of \\\\\\\\u2019third party\\\\\\\\u2019 as mentioned in its letter, to which Noticee, vide letter dated 07/07/2016 had submitted that they did not possess any further information of the transferees and that they have no further documentary evidence in support of the observations that Mrs. Malini Reddy transferred her entire holding  to a third party in the year 2006.  j) Since Equastone, being an entity promoted by wife of Shri Ravikumar, (CMD of ATL) and also a promoter group of ATL, the transactions with Equastone being Related Party transactions, should have been disclosed in the prospectus and Saffron failed to do the due diligence in this regard. Had Saffron independently verified the background of Equastone, even by accessing publically available information (like MCA database or any other such means), it would have known about the connection of Ravikumar/wife of Shri Ravikumar and Equastone. Thus, Saffron, as BRLM to the public issue of ATL has failed to do independent verification.  k) Noticee failed to exercise due diligence while ensuring the veracity and adequacy of disclosure made in the prospectus as required under Regulation 64(1) of ICDR Regulations and had also failed to perform its duties as mentioned under various clauses of Code of Conduct for Merchant Bankers specified under Schedule III in SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cMerchant Bankers Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d).Page 4 of 23  4. In view of the abovementioned findings of the investigation, adjudication proceeding is initiated in respect of the Noticee under section 15HB of the SEBI Act.  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  5. SEBI vide order dated June 12, 2017 appointed Shri Sahil Malik as the Adjudicating Officer under section 15 I of SEBI Act read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (SEBI Adjudicating Rules) for the alleged violations of Regulation 60(7)(a)  and 64(1) of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009 and  Regulation 13 read with Clause 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 & 20 of  Code of Conduct for Merchant Bankers specified under Schedule III in SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992 to inquire into and adjudge the aforesaid allegations under section 15HB of the SEBI Act. Pursuant to the transfer of Shri Sahil Malik, the undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer vide order dated August 13, 2019, to inquire into and adjudge the aforesaid violations.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE and REPLY  6. A Show Cause Notice dated December 15, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to the Noticee under Rule 4 of the SEBI Adjudicating Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated and penalty not be imposed under section 15HB of the SEBI Act for the allegation as detailed in the said SCN. The SCN was served upon the Noticee.   7. The SCN alleged the following non\\\\\\\\u2013disclosure/Wrong Disclosure in the Prospectus: a) It is alleged in the SCN that the Noticee, as BRLM to the public issue of ATL has failed to do independent verification, failed to exercise due diligence while ensuring the veracity and adequacy of disclosure made in the prospectus and had also failed to perform its duties as mentioned under various clauses of Code of Conduct for Merchant Bankers specified under Schedule III in Merchant Bankers Regulations. Due diligence certificate has been submitted by Noticee in the capacity of BRLM w.r.t the IPO of ATL.  b) As per the SCN ,the  role of Noticee  is as follows:  i) On page 64 of the prospectus, it was disclosed that ATL had taken a bridge loan of Rs. 20 crore, out of which Rs. 7 crore was used towards construction of building and remaining, towards working capital. However, ATL, vide its letter dated 02/05/2016, had informed that said amount of Rs. 7 crore was transferred to M/s Equastone Properties Pvt Ltd (Equastone) as advance towards construction of software development center. ATL has further submitted that subsequently said project was cancelled and ATL receivedPage 5 of 23  back the advance paid to Equastone. In this regard, it was observed that Equastone was a related entity of ATL / Shri Ravikumar.   ii) Further, from the bank account statements of ATL, it was observed that the remaining Rs. 13 crore was transferred abroad, for which no reason whatsoever could be provided by ATL. Hence, it is observed that entire transaction was not genuine and disclosure as appearing in the prospectus was wrong.   iii) Noticee being BRLM to the IPO of ATL had submitted due diligence certificate w.r.t the IPO of ATL.  8. The Noticee vide letter dated January 04, 2018 sought extension of time till January 12, 2018 to file the reply to the SCN. Thereafter, vide letter dated January 11, 2018, the Noticee submitted its reply to the SCN. The Noticee had also requested for a personal hearing in the matter. Accordingly, in the interest of natural justice, The Noticee was provided an opportunity of personal hearing through WebeX due to ongoing pandemic as well as for Hearing at SEBI Head Office on December 11, 2020 vide Hearing Notice (\\\\\\\\u201cHN\\\\\\\\u201d) dated December 02, 2020.  9. Since Enquiry proceeding had also been initiated against the Noticee parallely in this matter for same cause of action and set of violations and hearing in the matter was scheduled on November 10, 2020 in this regard, the Noticee along with its authorised representative appeared before designated authority and also made additional submission vide letter dated November 13, 2020.   10. Therefore, in response to the HN, Noticee in its letter dated December 07, 2020 has inter-alia stated that, the allegations in both the show cause notices are the same and since we have no further submissions to make we request you to kindly take our additional submissions during the personal hearing on November 10, 2020 and vide our letter dated November 13, 2020 as our further submissions to this Notice. As we have no further submissions to make in this regard, we would like to waive the opportunity afforded to us of the persona hearing on December 11, 2020 at 2.45 pm.  11. Thus, as requested by Noticee, the opportunity of personal hearing was done away with and his submissions made during the personal hearing on November 10, 2020 and letter dated November 13, 2020 has been taken on record and considered as further submissions in the instant proceedings.  12. In response to the allegations mentioned in the SCN, Noticee vide letter dated  January 11, 2018 and November 13, 2020 has inter-alia submitted the following: a. It is a fact that the Company took a bridge loan of Rs.20 crores, the details of which were prominently disclosed in Page 63 of the Red Herring ProspectusPage 6 of 23  dated February 02, 2011 filed with SEBI and again on page 63 in the Prospectus. The details of the usage of the funds was also disclosed in the RHP and Prospectus as Rs.7 crores towards construction of building and the remaining Rs.13 crores towards Working Capital. Both the uses are clearly as per the objects of the issue.   b. We would like to submit that as a part of the due diligence procedure, we circulate a checklist to our prospective clients, wherein the list of documents that are needed for due diligence and other particulars that are to be confirmed by the client is indicated. This document is circulated before the preparation of the DRHP and is continuously updated at the time of the preparation of RHP and the preparation of Prospectus.  c. One of the queries that is posed to our clients is to provide a list of the names of persons / entities who constitute the promoter / Promoter Group in accordance with the definition of Promoter and Promoter Group (Regulation 2(zb)) of the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009.  d. Based on the list provided the promoter / promoter group matrix is drawn up by us and as a part of the Due Diligence Procedure a cross verification is done with the other documents that are provided by the company. The documents with which cross verification is done are the Annual Reports of the Company particularly the section on Related Party Transactions which lists out all the entities with which the company is related and has transactions.   e. Since Section 297 of the Companies Act. 1956, inter alia, laid stress on the fact that a director of the company or his relative or a firm in which such a director or relative is a partner, any other partner in such a firm, or a private company of which the director is a member or director, shall not enter into any contract with the company - (a) for the sale, purchase or supply of any goods, materials or services;, except with the consent of the Board of Directors of the Company. Going by this directive, the Minutes of the Board Meetings and General Meetings were verified thoroughly by us to note / identify any related party transactions. The documents are verified for a period of 5 years before the date of Due Diligence and continued to be verified till filing of Prospectus.  f. In the present case, the name Equastone never figured in the Annual Reports for the financial years 2006 \\\\\\\\u2013 2010 under the section Related Party Transactions that the company had entered into. Further there was no reference to this name in the Minutes (Board and Shareholders) provided by the company to us for the five year period prior to February 2011. It is also submitted that the Company did not provide the name Equastone to us in the checklist provided to them under the head \\\\\\\\u201cPromoter and Promoter Group\\\\\\\\u201d.Page 7 of 23  g. It is further submitted that we also have to rely on the statements / certificates given by the statutory auditors of the company, who is considered an \\\\\\\\u201cExpert\\\\\\\\u201d under The Companies Act, 1956 for the purpose of Financial Statements and Tax Benefits included in the RHP and Prospectus. The Statutory Auditor determines who is a Related Party based on the guidelines given in accounting standards #18 issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the parameters specified and information provided by the company. It is pertinent to mention here that the Statutory Auditors, who have been associated with the company for a period of time have not mentioned the name Equastone under the head \\\\\\\\u201cRelated Party\\\\\\\\u201d in any of the Annual Reports or any further certificate that was provided by them to us. It is submitted here that the Company availed bridge loan in October 2010 and the RHP / Prospectus contained the details of the utilization of the proceeds of the bridge loan and the financial results as at December 31, 2010 and none of the notes contained therein as provided by the Statutory Auditors states that Equastone is a Related Party. The copy of the certificate given by the Statutory Auditors regarding the utilization of proceeds of the Bridge Loan is enclosed as Annexure 1. The financial statements as provided by the Statutory Auditors which is included in the RHP / Prospectus is attached as Annexure 2.  It may incidentally be noted that even in the Audit report for financial year 2010-11 (after the company got listed), neither Equastone is mentioned nor is this transaction mentioned under Related Party disclosure duly signed by the statutory auditor.  h. We also further submit that we also take certain declarations from the Promoters / Directors of the Company regarding the interest of the Directors / Promoters and we enclose a copy of the certificate received as Annexure 3 from which it can be seen that they have categorically stated that there were no contracts at all in which the directors / promoters were directly or indirectly interested except those stated under the related party transactions and Equastone did not figure in the Related Party Transactions.  i. Given the above, there was no other means by which we could have concluded that Equastone was a related party to the company.   j. We would also like to submit that unlike today\\\\\\\\u2019s scenario, at that time i.e 2010-11 the details of the directors, promoters, the companies in which they were interested in etc was not available for online search and the diligence had to be done only on the basis of declarations, filings done in the physical form and other documents that were sought by us for the due diligence purpose.  k. Since there was no mention of the name Equastone anywhere in any of the documents mentioned above, on which we rely upon to do the due diligence, we are confident that we have done our diligence with utmost care and have ensured full disclosure in the RHP as well as in the Prospectus.Page 8 of 23   l. With regard to Paragraph 121 we would like to state that working capital is for several purposes and this could be used by the company in India or by its branches / overseas subsidiaries. The allegation that the transactions are not genuine is an assumption and not based on facts. Working Capital is needed for meeting the liquidity positions, salaries, inventory management and to fund the expansion plans of the company. This could have been needed either at the Head Office at Bangalore or at any of its site offices or client locations globally. Therefore the amounts could have been transferred to any of these overseas offices/locations. As regards the usage of funds the Statutory Auditor after verification of the usage of funds has provided a certificate, copy of which is already enclosed as Annexure 1, that the amount is utilized for Working Capital. We therefore confirm that the disclosures as appearing in the Prospectus are true and not false as alleged.   m. We confirm that we have submitted a Due Diligence Certificate with regard to the IPO of the company as stated in Paragraph 122. To summarize the various levels at which we have done due diligence are as under:-  (A) The minutes book (Board and Shareholders) verified for last 5-6 years (B) The promoter and promoter group matrix duly signed by the promoter from time to time (C) The Statutory Auditors report dated 24th January, 2011 in connection with utilization of the bridge loan (D) The Statutory Auditors report dated 19th January, 2011 at the time of filing revised RHP / Prospectus (E) Declaration from company management stating that there are / there are no other contracts in which the promoters / directors are interested except for those discussed under the head \\\\\\\\u201cRelated Party Transactions\\\\\\\\u201d in the Annual Report / Financial Statements of the Company. (F) Annual Reports of the company of the last 5 financial years  With regard to the allegation in paragraph 123, we completely deny that we as BRLMs have failed to independent verification and have failed to exercise due diligence. We have exercised utmost care and caution and have carried out due diligence of the highest level. We have further ensured that the disclosures are true to the best of our knowledge and have performed all the duties mentioned under the Code of Conduct for Merchant Bankers with utmost sincerity  13. Noticee vide letter dated November 13, 2020 has inter-alia made the following submissions:  I. Equastone not classified as a Related Party:  Our submission:Page 9 of 23  Equastone, to which an advance of \\\\\\\\u20b9 7 crores has been given for construction has not been shown as a related party and this transaction has not been classified as a related party transaction. With regard to this, we would like to draw attention to the Order No: WTM/MPB/EFD-1-DRA-IV/67/2019 dated September 27, 2019, passed by the Whole Time Member, Ms. Madhabi Puri Buch, particularly paragraph no. 167 which is reproduced below:  \\\\\\\\u201cATL has denied making wrong disclosure in the Prospectus. It has submitted that the offer document has been certified by the Merchant Banker and the said certification cannot be ignored or rushed away lightly. In this regard, I note that Regulation 60(7)(a) of ICDR Regulations places the onus on the Issuer company to make true and fair disclosure in any advertisement caused to be issued by the Issuer. Further, Clause (IX)(B)(12) (a)(v) Part A of Schedule VIII of ICDR Regulations, also places the onus on Issuer to make disclosure of related party transactions. Therefore, in view of the explicit provisions imposing the burden on the Issuer Company, ATL cannot take shelter behind the certification given by the Merchant Banker and fail to discharge its independent responsibility to make true, fair and complete disclosure.\\\\\\\\u201d  From the above it is amply clear that the primary responsibility of making a disclosure of related parties and transactions with such related parties is with the Issuer Company and in the absence of such a disclosure from them, we as Merchant Bankers, would be unable to detect the same.  Having said that, in addition to the submissions made by us regarding the due diligence process undertaken by us while handling an issue, we would like to submit that we also check on the MCA website to see if any of the directors / promoters are associated with any other company details of which may not have been provided by the issuer. In the instant case, Ms. Malini Reddy, spouse of Mr. D. Ravikumar (Managing Director of Acropetal Technologies Limited), was not a director of Acropetal when the issue was being handled by us / DRHP was being prepared / RHP was filed with the ROC and SEBI. We were informed that she is occupied as a housewife and never takes part in any company activities. Since she was not a director or a promoter of the company and since she was only part of promoter group, that too because of definition under the ICDR Regulations, 2009, hence there was no ground to take her DIN Number or verify further. In the absence of a DIN Number, no data can be procured from the MCA Website and it is impossible to know the companies with which she was associated. Since the allegation that Equastone is a related party is only because Ms. Malini Reddy, wife of Managing Director was a majority shareholder this could not have been established by us by any amount of independent verification.Page 10 of 23  Equastone appears only as a top ten shareholder holding 3% equity of ATL on a pre-Issue capital and since the holding was less than 5%, no further enquiries about this entity was made. We make further enquiries only in respect of significant shareholders in the company. Equastone did not meet that criteria as it held only 3% equity of ATL (pre-Issue basis).    We would also like to draw your attention to Page No. 155 of the Red Herring Prospectus wherein, the statutory auditor, the expert with regard to the financial statements, has specifically stated the following on identifying related party transactions, (as a part of significant accounting policies) in confirmation with AS-18 of the Accounting Standards, applicable at that time:  \\\\\\\\u201c(m)  Related Party Transaction   Parties are considered to be related if at any time during the year, one party has the ability to control the other party or to exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and / or operating decision.\\\\\\\\u201d  Further the statutory auditor was the auditor of Acropetal since inception and was hence expected to know the details of the company and the nature of its dealings in detail.  Attention is also drawn to Annexure 18 appearing on Page 168 / 169 of the Red Herring Prospectus, where the statutory auditor has listed the Related Parties and the details of the transactions with them in accordance with AS -18. It is an expert certification and based on a very comprehensive and exhaustive definition of Related Party and Related Party Transactions. Equastone neither figures anywhere as either Related Party or in Related Party Transactions  Since we did not have the requirement to verify the connection of Ms. Malini Reddy on the  MCA website (also at the nascent stage at that time as it had gone online only in September 2006), we had to rely on the Board Minutes, Annual Report, Balance Sheet, declarations of the promoters/directors / management of the Issuer Company. At this juncture we would like to rely on the SAT Order in the matter of Corporate Strategic Alliance Vs SEBI passed on 29.03.2019 as per which, \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026... The balance sheet has been duly audited by the Statutory Auditors and accepted by the Income Tax Authorities. It is not open to the AO to question the entries in the balance sheet. The AO is not an expert to juggle the accounting figures and hold as to which entry should come under \"Fixed Assets\" or under the \"Revenue Expenditure\". The Merchant Banker has only disclosed what the balance sheet was showing for which purpose the Merchant Banker cannot be found at fault\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201dPage 11 of 23  We would also like to draw your kind attention to paragraph 171 of Order No. WTM/MPB/EFD-1-DRA-IV/67/2019 dated September 27, 2019, passed by the Whole Time Member, Ms. Madhabi Puri Buch, wherein it is stated that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.Moreover, no material has been brought on record to show that why the transaction with Equatstone would have raised red flags for the Directors especially when the money was transferred to Equastone\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d which only shows that the Board Minutes or any other document that was available for verification did not contain Equastone as a related party to enable us to make further enquiries in this regard.  To summarize, we have checked at 5 levels of diligence: a) Audited Annual Reports of ATL for last 5 years b) Minutes book of ATL for last 5 years c) Undertakings/Declarations from the management of ATL d) Restated Audit report signed by the statutory auditor of ATL e) Promoter & Promoter group matrix submitted by the Company   There has been no reference whatsoever of Equastone in any of the above, either as a related party or a part of any related party transactions. Therefore, such disclosures had to necessarily come from the Issuer Company and/or the reports which were issued by the statutory auditor, who was the auditor of the Issue Company since its incorporation in April 2001. Hence, we sincerely believe it was beyond reasonable diligence to suspect that Equastone was a related party. There was just no reason to suspect the same.  II. Working capital of Rs 13 crores:  Our submission:  It has been alleged that Rs 13 crores was transferred abroad and therefore these transactions do not appear to be genuine. In this regard we would like to submit that Acropetal was a 100% Export Oriented Unit (EOU) and was operating from a Software Technology Park. The financial statements as given in pages 152, 170-172 (standalone) and 178, 193-195 (consolidated) of the RHP of Acropetal, which discuss the P/L statements and geographical break-up of revenue (as a part of Annexure 20 of the Financial Statements) indicate that almost 100% of the revenue earned by the company was from exports from USA, Middle East, Europe and Asia. Hence it is but natural that funds for working capital would be spent overseas.  In case the operations of the Issuer company were domestic in nature, and the money had been spent abroad, it would have been suspicious and raised a red-flag. Since the operations of ATL were entirely from foreign countries, these transactions appeared to be genuine to us.Page 12 of 23   Further the Statutory Auditor had classified the same as Working Capital in the statement of deployment of funds and the statutory auditor being an expert, he is the authority as regards the classification of various head of expenditure. We would again like to rely on SAT Order in the matter of Corporate Strategic Alliance Vs SEBI passed on 29.03.2019 as per which, \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026... The balance sheet has been duly audited by the Statutory Auditors and accepted by the Income Tax Authorities. It is not open to the AO to question the entries in the balance sheet. The AO is not an expert to juggle the accounting figures and hold as to which entry should come under \"Fixed Assets\" or under the \"Revenue Expenditure\". The Merchant Banker has only disclosed what the balance sheet was showing for which purpose the Merchant Banker cannot be found at fault\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d  Infact even post-IPO, SEBI mandates that the utilization of IPO proceeds be certified by the statutory auditor and disclosed in the quarterly and annual financial statements of the Issuer company. This norm of diligence was followed by us, and till date is being followed by all Merchant Bankers and Issuer Companies (except for IPO\\\\\\\\u2019s where monitoring agency is required to be appointed).  We summarise the above as: a) ATL was a 100% EoU, operating from a STP b) ATL had almost 100% revenues from export income, across world geographies c) Hence it was natural that working capital funds would be spent overseas d) Funds deployed as working capital were certified by the statutory auditor in the statement of funds deployed e) Statutory auditor certification for Post-IPO funds utilization is the norm for back-up and diligence   Based on the aforesaid, we sincerely believed that the working capital funds spent were towards genuine expenditure and there was no reason for us to suspect anything suspicious.   Concluding submission  We would once again like to humbly submit that we had exercised due diligence in letter and spirit and we have not violated the provisions of Regulation 60(7)(a) and Regulation 64 of the ICDR Regulations, 2009 or the Code of Conduct for Merchant Bankers. As far as diligence is concerned, we believe we are an extended arm of the regulator and conduct our diligence activities accordingly. Ever since we received our SEBI Merchant Banking License in the year 2008, we have not been involved in any adjudication proceedings or matters involving serious offences/frauds and no penalties have been imposed on us.Page 13 of 23   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS  14. I have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticee in the SCN, the material / documents available on record and oral and written submissions of the Noticee. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are :   I.

II. Do the violations, if any, on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under section 15HB of SEBI Act;  and  III. If so, what would be the quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee after taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act read with respective Adjudication Rules?  15.

From an analysis of Bank statements, the following is observed: 9.3.1. The aforesaid bank accounts are active.  9.3.2. The total credit received in the aforesaid bank accounts is approximately Rs. 95,30,047/- during the period April 12, 2019 to  December 05, 2020.   10. I find that BMS had displayed the bank account of Mr. Ashwin Doriya in its website for the purpose of receiving fee, for the services which are mentioned in website of BMS. The bank amount of Mr. Ashwin Doriya was opened on September 09, 2020. Therefore, Mr. Ashwin Doriya by virtue of actively allowing his bank account displayed in the website of BMS for the purpose of receipt of fee and actually receiving the fee,  is acting together with Mr. Naresh Nimawat in providing services which are mentioned in the website of BMS from September 09, 2020.  In light of the aforesaid discussions, I prima facie observe that Mr. Naresh Nimawat, proprietor of CNR and BMS and Mr. Ashwin Doriya by acting together with Mr. Naresh Nimawat, has been putting the information in public domain / advertising by using websites namely www.capitalnivesh.com (previously active) and www.brightmoneysolutions.com (currently active) about the various services offered by them in securities market. The information available in both website is almost similar / identical. It is also prima facie observed that various plans / packages are being offered by them to avail their services. Thus, I prima facie observe, that Mr. Naresh Nimawat, proprietor of CNR and BMS and Mr. Ashwin Doriya by acting together with Mr. Naresh Nimawat were / are, prima facie, holding themselves out as an investment adviser.   11. In view of the above facts and circumstances, especially the content of the websites coupled with the credit transactions in the bank accounts, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees / funds credited to the bank accounts, were for the purpose of availing the services indicated on the website of CNR and BMS. I note that CNR had used the bank account held in the name of Mr. Naresh Nimawat for collection of funds. As reflected from the bank statement, I prima facie note that CNR has commenced with the collection of fees/ funds for the purpose of providing the services from April 2019. From the AOF/ KYC of BMS for account opened with HDFC Bank, I note the date of incorporation of BMS is February 04, 2020. Thus, it prima facie appears that Mr. Naresh Nimawat, proprietor of CNR and BMS is__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Capital Nivesh Research and Bright Money Solutions                                                                                       Page 8 of 21 carrying out services related to investments in securities market as mentioned in websites from April 12, 2019 and February 04, 2020 respectively.  12. In this regard, I have perused the definition of investment adviser as given in regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, which states that investment adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have also perused the Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines investment advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d  13. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is, prima facie noted, from the contents of the websites of CNR and BMS that they were / are holding themselves out as investment adviser by offering to provide services related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription and these services fall within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advice\\\\\\\\u201d under Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations. Further, multiple credit entries have been received in the bank accounts, which when seen together with the contents of the websites, leads to, on preponderance of probability basis, a prima facie, conclusion that the credit entries in the bank account are consideration for the investment advice given by CNR and BMS to its clients. Thus, prima facie, CNR and BMS was / is an investment adviser as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations.  14. Further, it is also prima facie observed from CNR and BMS webpages that both claim to be registered with SEBI as investment advisory firm. The fact that CNR and BMS, is claiming  so registered with SEBI to provide investment advisory services and offers various subscription packages in various segments of the market viz, equity, derivatives and commodity, when seen in light of the receipt of money in its bank accounts, prima facie__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Capital Nivesh Research and Bright Money Solutions                                                                                       Page 9 of 21 shows, on preponderance of probability basis, that the credit of money is in fact the fee for the investment advisory services rendered by CNR and BMS. Therefore, CNR and BMS has not only held themselves out as investment adviser but has also acted as an investment adviser for consideration.  ISSUE No. 2:  If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether CNR and BMS have, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act read with IA Regulations and provisions of PFUTP Regulations?   15. In order to ensure that investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of SEBI Act states that  \\\\\\\\u201cNo  stock  broker,  sub -broker,  share  transfer  agent,  banker  to  an  issue,  trustee  of  trust deed,  registrar  to  an  issue,  merchant  banker,  underwriter,  portfolio  manager,  investment adviser  and  such  other  intermediary  who  may  be  associated  with  securities  market  shall  buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration  obtained  from  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the regulations  made under  this Act\\\\\\\\u201d  16. Further, Regulation 3(1) of the IA regulations, states that \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.   17. Thus, as per Section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Regulation 3(1) of IA Regulations, any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI regulations i.e. the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Capital Nivesh Research and Bright Money Solutions                                                                                       Page 10 of 21 18. The activities of CNR and BMS, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions shows that CNR and BMS were / are holding themselves out as investment advisers and have acted / are acting as investment advisers. However, no material was available on record to indicate that CNR or BMS or its proprietor Mr. Naresh Nimawat in his individual capacity had a certificate of registration as an Investment Adviser. In this context, it is noted that CNR, BMS, Mr. Naresh Nimawat and Ashwin Doriya in their individual capacity are not registered with SEBI as intermediary. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by both CNR and BMS, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, leads to the conclusion that CNR and BMS were / are holding themselves out and acting as investment advisers without a certificate of registration from SEBI. In my view, these activities/ representations of CNR and BMS were / are, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.  19. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the provisions of Regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations defines \\\\\\\\u2018fraud\\\\\\\\u2019 and \\\\\\\\u2018fraudulent\\\\\\\\u2019 which state as under:   \\\\\\\\u201c(c) \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d includes any act, expression, omission or concealment committed whether in a deceitful manner or not by a person or by any other person with his connivance or by his agent while dealing in securities in order to induce another person or his agent to deal in securities, whether or not there is any wrongful gain or avoidance of any loss, and shall also include\\\\\\\\u2014  (1) a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of material fact in order that another person may act to his detriment;  (2) a suggestion as to a fact which is not true by one who does not believe it to be true;  (3) an active concealment of a fact by a person having knowledge or belief of the fact;  (4) a promise made without any intention of performing it;  (5) a representation made in a reckless and careless manner whether it be true or false;  (6) any such act or omission as any other law specifically declares to be fraudulent,__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Capital Nivesh Research and Bright Money Solutions                                                                                       Page 11 of 21 (7) deceptive behaviour by a person depriving another of informed consent or full participation,  (8) a false statement made without reasonable ground for believing it to be true.  (9) the act of an issuer of securities giving out misinformation that affects the market price of the security, resulting in investors being effectively misled even though they did not rely on the statement itself or anything derived from it other than the market price.    And \\\\\\\\u201cfraudulent\\\\\\\\u201d shall be construed accordingly \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d   20.

(2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a manipulative fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves any of the following: - \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026 (k) disseminating information or advice through any media, whether physical or digital, which the disseminator knows to be false or misleading and which is designed or likely to influence the decision of investors dealing in securities.\\\\\\\\u201d  21. From the website of CNR and BMS, it is noted that they claim to be registered with SEBI as an investment advisory firm which follows all the norms made by SEBI for investor protection. Thus, prima facie, CNR and BMS are knowingly concealing the fact that they are not registered with SEBI as an investment advisor and are also making representations knowing that   the representations are  false, thereby luring and inducing investors to deal in securities by availing their services  22. The above discussed   act of CNR and BMS is prima facie, fraudulent and are covered under the definition of 'fraud' defined under regulation 2(1)(c) of PFUTP Regulations. Thus, prima__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Capital Nivesh Research and Bright Money Solutions                                                                                       Page 13 of 21 facie fraudulent activity / conduct / act / practice of CNR and BMS as discussed above are prima facie in violation of provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b), (c) of SEBI Act and regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of PFUTP Regulations.  ISSUE NO. 3:  If answers to Issue Nos. 1 & 2 are affirmative, who are responsible for the violations?  23. I note that Mr. Naresh Nimawat is the sole proprietor of CNR and BMS. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in Ashok Transport Agency vs. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business. . A suit by or against a proprietary concern is by or against the proprietor of the business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Mr. Naresh Nimawat is liable for the acts of CNR and BMS. I further find that Mr. Ashwin Doriya had allowed his bank account for the purpose of collection fee and has been acting together with Mr. Naresh Nimawat from September 09, 2020. Therefore, Mr. Ashwin Doriya is jointly and severally liable with Mr. Naresh Nimawat for the acts of BMS from September 09, 2020. Further, I also prima facie find that Mr. Naresh Nimawat is using multiple websites with different names to carry out unregistered Investment advisory activity.   ISSUE NO. 4:  If answer to Issue No. 2 is in affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any should be issued against those responsible for the violations?  24. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The PFUTP Regulations and IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of preventing fraudulent activities and regulating investment advisory activities to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of investment advisory activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations inter alia seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Capital Nivesh Research and Bright Money Solutions                                                                                       Page 14 of 21 investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market. Similarly, the PFUTP Regulations seeks to curb fraudulent and manipulative activities in the securities market in order to boost investor confidence in the securities market and to provide an environment conductive to increased participation and investment in the securities market which is vital to the growth and development of the economy.  25. In the instant case, it is noted that CNR and BMS are soliciting and inducing the investors to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips, intra-day calls etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration as mandated under the IA Regulations and under the fraudulent claim of being SEBI registered investment advisory intermediary.

Nature of Account: Agriculture/ Commodity__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 7 of 23 8.3. Certificate issued by a Chartered Accountant mentions that the firm is engaged in the business of Gold, Silver and Agriculture Commodities. 8.4. Certificate issued by Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises mentions that major activity of the firm is \\\\\\\\u201cManufacturing\\\\\\\\u201d and the industry classification is mentioned as \\\\\\\\u201cCrop and animal production, hunting, seed processing for irrigation\\\\\\\\u201d.  9. The following information is gathered from the bank account statement (upto 09/12/2020):  9.1. A large number of cash deposits have been made into the said account.  9.2. The bank statement of Punjab National Bank (PNB) was verified for receipt of funds from the complainant and abovementioned clients and it was observed that funds had been received from these clients into the said bank account. It was also observed that these complainants had made payments in the denominations of Rs. 5499/ 11999/ 14999/- Hence, prima facie, it appears that the firm was providing service plans in denominations of Rs. 5499/ 11999/ 14999/-. The date of last such entry is as recent as September 14, 2020.   9.3. At this stage there is no sufficient material on record to determine the total amount collected and the same requires further examination for the purpose of ascertainment of the total amount of money collected as fees for the service.   9.4. Further, the entity may have received funds from investors/ clients/ subscribers in various other denominations and not just restricted to \\\\\\\\u201cRs. 5499/11999/14999\\\\\\\\u201d and hence, the same may not be treated as a precedent.  10. Considering the analysis of the bank statement, KYC/ AOF documents, extracts of the SMS, WhatsApp sent to investors, I, prima facie, observe that Vinayak Tradelink has represented that it is an investment advisory firm that provides tips for the stock and__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 8 of 23 commodity markets. It is, prima facie, observed that Vinayak Tradelink is approaching investors through means other than a website, about various services offered by it in the securities market. Further, it is also, prima facie, observed that pursuant to payment of subscription fees by investors, Vinayak Tradelink is providing calls/ tips via SMS/ WhatsApp to such clients.   11. Considering the above facts and circumstances, the contents of the messages sent to the complainants after they have subscribed to the packages offered by Vinayak Tradelink, coupled with the direct credit transactions in the bank accounts in various denominations, including those of Rs. 5499/11999/14999/-, as detailed above, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees/ funds credited to the bank accounts, were for the purpose of providing the services indicated by Vinayak Tradelink. It can also be seen that it is mentioned in the message sent to the complaint that the service is valid from September 13, 2020, till March 12, 2023, i.e., the firm intends to continue providing the service till then.  12. In this regard, I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d  13. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is, prima facie, observed from the contents of the messages, that Vinayak Tradelink is engaged in the business of providing investment advice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities, to__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 9 of 23 clients, for consideration, and is also offering various investment packages for subscription and as such, these services fall within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advice\\\\\\\\u201d under Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations. Further, multiple credit entries have been received in the bank accounts, which when seen together with the contents of the messages, leads to, on preponderance of probability basis, a, prima facie, conclusion that the credit entries in the bank account are consideration for the investment advice given by Vinayak Tradelink to its clients. Thus, prima facie, Vinayak Tradelink is an investment adviser as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations.  14. Therefore, I find that Vinayak Tradelink is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients for consideration.  Issue No.2: If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether Vinayak Tradelink has, prima facie, violated any provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) read with SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (\\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) and the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (\\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d)?  15. In order to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 10 of 23 with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  16. Further, as per Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.  17. It is noted that Vinayak Tradelink is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of an investment adviser, while the characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by it, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, lead to the conclusion that it is acting as an investment adviser. However, no material is available on record to indicate that Vinayak Tradelink or its proprietor, Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati, in his individual capacity, have a certificate of registration as an investment adviser. It is also noted that Vinayak Tradelink and its proprietor, Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati, in his individual capacity, are not registered with SEBI in any capacity.  18. Thus, in my view, these activities/ representations of Vinayak Tradelink without holding the certificate of registration as an investment adviser are, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.  19. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and Regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of the PFUTP Regulations. The text of the aforesaid provisions is reproduced below:  SEBI Act__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 11 of 23 Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control Section 12A: No person shall directly or indirectly:  (a) use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  (b) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange; (c) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  PFUTP Regulations Regulation 3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities No person shall directly or indirectly- (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under; (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 12 of 23 in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.  4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a manipulative, fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities market. (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a manipulative fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves any of the following: - \\\\\\\\u2026 (k) disseminating information or advice through any media, whether physical or digital, which the disseminator knows to be false or misleading and which is designed or likely to influence the decision of investors dealing in securities\\\\\\\\u201d.  20. In my view, an unregistered investment adviser like Vinayak Tradelink can put investors at great risk by misleading them. Without having a registered investment adviser certificate, Vinayak Tradelink is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients with the objective of making money/ collecting fees through subscriptions. Furthermore, it can be seen from the messages sent to clients that the firm has claimed the following:  \\\\\\\\u201cGet next day profit 2.30 lakh\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u201cWe provide above 95% accuracy\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u201cIf you are interested to robo trade service u can join  Plan-1- pay 11999/- for software charge daily (30% sharing on profit)\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u201c60000 investment required Daily 5-10% guarantee profit.\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u201cANYONE JOINING DMAT ACCOUNT HANDLE SERVICE MONTHLY 25% MINIMUM FIX RETURN.\\\\\\\\u201d__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 13 of 23 21. Thus, by making the aforesaid claims of \\\\\\\\u201cprofit\\\\\\\\u201d, \\\\\\\\u201c95% accuracy\\\\\\\\u201d, \\\\\\\\u201cprofit sharing\\\\\\\\u201d, \\\\\\\\u201cDaily 5-10% guarantee profit\\\\\\\\u201d, Vinayak Tradelink is, prima facie, inducing investors to deal in securities by availing its services. Such modus operandi is being continuously used by Vinayak Tradelink, which is evident from the fact that there are continuous credits in its bank accounts.  22. It is observed that the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s claim to provide a specific return on client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment or to claim guaranteed profit, is, prima facie, an active concealment of the material fact that every investment in the market is subject to market risk. Considering the dynamics of the market, the returns from the investment in the market are unpredictable, no matter how much and for how long the investment is made. This act of conveying specific returns or certainty of profit, is, prima facie, indulged for the purpose of luring customers in its net and thereby increasing its income. In light of the same, the act of the firm to actively conceal material information, is a non-genuine and a deceptive act and has been, prima facie, made with an intent to influence the client to avail its advisory services.  23. The above discussed omission and act of Vinayak Tradelink are, prima facie, fraudulent and are covered under the definition of 'fraud' defined under regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations which reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d includes any act, expression, omission or concealment committed whether in a deceitful manner or not by a person or by any other person with his connivance or by his agent while dealing in securities in order to induce another person or his agent to deal in securities, whether or not there is any wrongful gain or avoidance of any loss, and shall also include-- (1) a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of material fact in order that another person may act to his detriment; (2) a suggestion as to a fact which is not true by one who does not believe it to be true;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 14 of 23 (3) an active concealment of a fact by a person having knowledge or belief of the fact; (4) a promise made without any intention of performing it; (5) a representation made in a reckless and careless manner whether it be true or false; (6) any such act or omission as any other law specifically declares to be fraudulent; (7) deceptive behavior by a person depriving another of informed consent or full participation; (8) a false statement made without reasonable ground for believing it to be true; (9) the act of an issuer of securities giving out misinformation that affects the market price of the security, resulting in investors being effectively misled even though they did not rely on the statement itself or anything derived from it other than the market price.  And \\\\\\\\u201cfraudulent\\\\\\\\u201d shall be construed accordingly;  24. It is noted that, prima facie, fraudulent activities / conduct / act / practice of Vinayak Tradelink as discussed above are, prima facie, in violation of provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and Regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of the PFUTP Regulations.  Issue No.3: If answers to Issue Nos. (1) & (2) are affirmative, who are all responsible for the violations?  25. I note that Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati is the sole proprietor of Vinayak Tradelink. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in Ashok Transport Agency vs. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 15 of 23 \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business... A suit by or against a proprietary concern is by or against the proprietor of the business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d.   26. Therefore, I find that Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati is liable for the acts/ omissions of Vinayak Tradelink.  Issue No. 4: If answer to Issue No. (2) is affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any, should be issued against those responsible for the violations?  27. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The PFUTP Regulations and the IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of preventing fraudulent activities and regulating investment advisory activities to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of investment advisory activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations, inter alia, seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the criteria set out in the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market. Similarly, the PFUTP Regulations seeks to curb fraudulent and manipulative activities in the securities market in order to boost investor confidence in the securities market and to provide an environment conductive to increased participation and investment in the securities market which is vital to the growth and development of the economy.  28. In the instant case, Vinayak Tradelink is soliciting/ inducing members of the public to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration/certification as mandated under the IA__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 16 of 23 Regulations. Further, it is noted from material available on record, that money has been credited to the bank accounts even recently during the period of examination. From the details of the complaints and bank account KYC, the following contact numbers are available on record (with their active/ inactive status checked on https://www.findandtrace.com/):  Number Status +91-9830120784 Active +91-8980658123 Active  29. Thus, the entity, its bank account and mobile numbers associated with the entity are active and can continue to be used to collect fees from unsuspecting members of the public.   30. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the, prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Vinayak Tradelink from collecting any more fees from the public and from indulging in fraudulent and unauthorized investment advisory activities. It is noted from material available on record that the last credit transaction in the bank account of Vinayak Tradelink with PNB, in denomination of Rs. 5499/11999/14999/-, is as recent as 14/09/2020. Further, as mentioned above, the telephone number associated with the entity are still active. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered services provided by Vinayak Tradelink in the securities market is still in existence and imminent.   31. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from an unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from unregistered investment adviser vis-a-vis an investor who receives such service from a SEBI registered investment adviser stands at a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 17 of 23 under the IA Regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not even satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment adviser. Availing such services from unregistered entities is detrimental to investors and such unregistered service would result in irreparable damage as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victims of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury/ detriment to the development of the securities market also qualifies as an \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d. The objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market.  32. Further, if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may have to part with large fees and investments resulting into irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is the right of the current entity herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the ex-parte orders in the case of private suits and ex-parte public enforcement actions, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential deployment of funds by the investors by following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if, prima facie, unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing an ex-parte-interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favor of Vinayak Tradelink and its Proprietor, Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati.____________________________________________________________________________________________________", "Date": "2020-12-16", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Proprietor: Mr.Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders-that-could-not-be-served/dec-2020/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-vinayak-tradelink-proprietor-mr-vivek-mahendragiri-ramdati-_52982.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 57941, "unique_record_id": "bab0f58e46SEBI20201216", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "66808ec57858910306471606", "parse_date": "2024-06-29 22:45:58", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Fraud - Unregistered", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "No financial penalties mentioned.", "gpt_audience": "1.

Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 2 of 23 SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s Examination:  3.

As per the intermediary database on SEBI website, it is observed that the firm is not registered with SEBI in any capacity. It is also observed that the proprietor, Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati, is also not registered with SEBI, in his individual capacity, as an investment adviser or any other intermediary. Thereafter, SEBI carried out a preliminary examination to ascertain whether unregistered investment advisory activities are being carried out by Vinayak Tradelink.  CONSIDERATION & PRIMA FACIE FINDINGS  6. I have perused the material available on record such as information available from the bank account statements, KYC/ AOF documents of Vinayak Tradelink and details of complaints received against it.

The complainant has provided the following message he received after paying Rs. 5499/-:  Dear Customer, Thank u For Your options Service.

The complainant also provided a screenshot of the messages/ tips received from Vinayak Tradelink through WhatsApp, which is as under:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop.

During enquiry with these people, it was found out that they were clients of Vinayak Tradelink and had received investment advisory services from Vinayak Tradelink. They were asked to provide details of tips/SMS received from Vinayak Tradelink and the following extract was received from them:  Client name Tips received Arjunsingh Shankar PNB Bank Vinayak tradelink Acc : 4637002100003176 IFSC : PUNB0463700  10-09-2020  If you are interested to robo trade service u can join  Plan-1- pay 11999/- for software charge daily (30% sharing on profit)  Plan-2 pay 14999/- monthly service.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop.

Nature of Account: Agriculture/ Commodity__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 7 of 23 8.3. Certificate issued by a Chartered Accountant mentions that the firm is engaged in the business of Gold, Silver and Agriculture Commodities. 8.4. Certificate issued by Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises mentions that major activity of the firm is \\\\\\\\u201cManufacturing\\\\\\\\u201d and the industry classification is mentioned as \\\\\\\\u201cCrop and animal production, hunting, seed processing for irrigation\\\\\\\\u201d.  9. The following information is gathered from the bank account statement (upto 09/12/2020):  9.1. A large number of cash deposits have been made into the said account.  9.2. The bank statement of Punjab National Bank (PNB) was verified for receipt of funds from the complainant and abovementioned clients and it was observed that funds had been received from these clients into the said bank account. It was also observed that these complainants had made payments in the denominations of Rs. 5499/ 11999/ 14999/- Hence, prima facie, it appears that the firm was providing service plans in denominations of Rs. 5499/ 11999/ 14999/-. The date of last such entry is as recent as September 14, 2020.   9.3. At this stage there is no sufficient material on record to determine the total amount collected and the same requires further examination for the purpose of ascertainment of the total amount of money collected as fees for the service.   9.4. Further, the entity may have received funds from investors/ clients/ subscribers in various other denominations and not just restricted to \\\\\\\\u201cRs. 5499/11999/14999\\\\\\\\u201d and hence, the same may not be treated as a precedent.  10. Considering the analysis of the bank statement, KYC/ AOF documents, extracts of the SMS, WhatsApp sent to investors, I, prima facie, observe that Vinayak Tradelink has represented that it is an investment advisory firm that provides tips for the stock and__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 8 of 23 commodity markets. It is, prima facie, observed that Vinayak Tradelink is approaching investors through means other than a website, about various services offered by it in the securities market. Further, it is also, prima facie, observed that pursuant to payment of subscription fees by investors, Vinayak Tradelink is providing calls/ tips via SMS/ WhatsApp to such clients.   11. Considering the above facts and circumstances, the contents of the messages sent to the complainants after they have subscribed to the packages offered by Vinayak Tradelink, coupled with the direct credit transactions in the bank accounts in various denominations, including those of Rs. 5499/11999/14999/-, as detailed above, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees/ funds credited to the bank accounts, were for the purpose of providing the services indicated by Vinayak Tradelink. It can also be seen that it is mentioned in the message sent to the complaint that the service is valid from September 13, 2020, till March 12, 2023, i.e., the firm intends to continue providing the service till then.  12. In this regard, I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d  13. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is, prima facie, observed from the contents of the messages, that Vinayak Tradelink is engaged in the business of providing investment advice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities, to__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 9 of 23 clients, for consideration, and is also offering various investment packages for subscription and as such, these services fall within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advice\\\\\\\\u201d under Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations. Further, multiple credit entries have been received in the bank accounts, which when seen together with the contents of the messages, leads to, on preponderance of probability basis, a, prima facie, conclusion that the credit entries in the bank account are consideration for the investment advice given by Vinayak Tradelink to its clients. Thus, prima facie, Vinayak Tradelink is an investment adviser as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations.  14. Therefore, I find that Vinayak Tradelink is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients for consideration.  Issue No.2: If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether Vinayak Tradelink has, prima facie, violated any provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) read with SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (\\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) and the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (\\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d)?  15. In order to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 10 of 23 with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  16. Further, as per Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.  17. It is noted that Vinayak Tradelink is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of an investment adviser, while the characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by it, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, lead to the conclusion that it is acting as an investment adviser. However, no material is available on record to indicate that Vinayak Tradelink or its proprietor, Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati, in his individual capacity, have a certificate of registration as an investment adviser. It is also noted that Vinayak Tradelink and its proprietor, Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati, in his individual capacity, are not registered with SEBI in any capacity.  18. Thus, in my view, these activities/ representations of Vinayak Tradelink without holding the certificate of registration as an investment adviser are, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.  19. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and Regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of the PFUTP Regulations. The text of the aforesaid provisions is reproduced below:  SEBI Act__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 11 of 23 Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control Section 12A: No person shall directly or indirectly:  (a) use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  (b) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange; (c) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  PFUTP Regulations Regulation 3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities No person shall directly or indirectly- (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under; (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 12 of 23 in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.  4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a manipulative, fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities market. (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a manipulative fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves any of the following: - \\\\\\\\u2026 (k) disseminating information or advice through any media, whether physical or digital, which the disseminator knows to be false or misleading and which is designed or likely to influence the decision of investors dealing in securities\\\\\\\\u201d.  20. In my view, an unregistered investment adviser like Vinayak Tradelink can put investors at great risk by misleading them. Without having a registered investment adviser certificate, Vinayak Tradelink is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients with the objective of making money/ collecting fees through subscriptions. Furthermore, it can be seen from the messages sent to clients that the firm has claimed the following:  \\\\\\\\u201cGet next day profit 2.30 lakh\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u201cWe provide above 95% accuracy\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u201cIf you are interested to robo trade service u can join  Plan-1- pay 11999/- for software charge daily (30% sharing on profit)\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u201c60000 investment required Daily 5-10% guarantee profit.\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u201cANYONE JOINING DMAT ACCOUNT HANDLE SERVICE MONTHLY 25% MINIMUM FIX RETURN.\\\\\\\\u201d__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 13 of 23 21. Thus, by making the aforesaid claims of \\\\\\\\u201cprofit\\\\\\\\u201d, \\\\\\\\u201c95% accuracy\\\\\\\\u201d, \\\\\\\\u201cprofit sharing\\\\\\\\u201d, \\\\\\\\u201cDaily 5-10% guarantee profit\\\\\\\\u201d, Vinayak Tradelink is, prima facie, inducing investors to deal in securities by availing its services. Such modus operandi is being continuously used by Vinayak Tradelink, which is evident from the fact that there are continuous credits in its bank accounts.  22. It is observed that the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s claim to provide a specific return on client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment or to claim guaranteed profit, is, prima facie, an active concealment of the material fact that every investment in the market is subject to market risk. Considering the dynamics of the market, the returns from the investment in the market are unpredictable, no matter how much and for how long the investment is made. This act of conveying specific returns or certainty of profit, is, prima facie, indulged for the purpose of luring customers in its net and thereby increasing its income. In light of the same, the act of the firm to actively conceal material information, is a non-genuine and a deceptive act and has been, prima facie, made with an intent to influence the client to avail its advisory services.  23. The above discussed omission and act of Vinayak Tradelink are, prima facie, fraudulent and are covered under the definition of 'fraud' defined under regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations which reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d includes any act, expression, omission or concealment committed whether in a deceitful manner or not by a person or by any other person with his connivance or by his agent while dealing in securities in order to induce another person or his agent to deal in securities, whether or not there is any wrongful gain or avoidance of any loss, and shall also include-- (1) a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of material fact in order that another person may act to his detriment; (2) a suggestion as to a fact which is not true by one who does not believe it to be true;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 14 of 23 (3) an active concealment of a fact by a person having knowledge or belief of the fact; (4) a promise made without any intention of performing it; (5) a representation made in a reckless and careless manner whether it be true or false; (6) any such act or omission as any other law specifically declares to be fraudulent; (7) deceptive behavior by a person depriving another of informed consent or full participation; (8) a false statement made without reasonable ground for believing it to be true; (9) the act of an issuer of securities giving out misinformation that affects the market price of the security, resulting in investors being effectively misled even though they did not rely on the statement itself or anything derived from it other than the market price.  And \\\\\\\\u201cfraudulent\\\\\\\\u201d shall be construed accordingly;  24. It is noted that, prima facie, fraudulent activities / conduct / act / practice of Vinayak Tradelink as discussed above are, prima facie, in violation of provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and Regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of the PFUTP Regulations.  Issue No.3: If answers to Issue Nos. (1) & (2) are affirmative, who are all responsible for the violations?  25. I note that Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati is the sole proprietor of Vinayak Tradelink. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in Ashok Transport Agency vs. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 15 of 23 \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business... A suit by or against a proprietary concern is by or against the proprietor of the business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d.   26. Therefore, I find that Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati is liable for the acts/ omissions of Vinayak Tradelink.  Issue No. 4: If answer to Issue No. (2) is affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any, should be issued against those responsible for the violations?  27. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The PFUTP Regulations and the IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of preventing fraudulent activities and regulating investment advisory activities to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of investment advisory activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations, inter alia, seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the criteria set out in the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market. Similarly, the PFUTP Regulations seeks to curb fraudulent and manipulative activities in the securities market in order to boost investor confidence in the securities market and to provide an environment conductive to increased participation and investment in the securities market which is vital to the growth and development of the economy.  28. In the instant case, Vinayak Tradelink is soliciting/ inducing members of the public to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration/certification as mandated under the IA__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 16 of 23 Regulations. Further, it is noted from material available on record, that money has been credited to the bank accounts even recently during the period of examination. From the details of the complaints and bank account KYC, the following contact numbers are available on record (with their active/ inactive status checked on https://www.findandtrace.com/):  Number Status +91-9830120784 Active +91-8980658123 Active  29. Thus, the entity, its bank account and mobile numbers associated with the entity are active and can continue to be used to collect fees from unsuspecting members of the public.   30. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the, prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Vinayak Tradelink from collecting any more fees from the public and from indulging in fraudulent and unauthorized investment advisory activities. It is noted from material available on record that the last credit transaction in the bank account of Vinayak Tradelink with PNB, in denomination of Rs. 5499/11999/14999/-, is as recent as 14/09/2020. Further, as mentioned above, the telephone number associated with the entity are still active. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered services provided by Vinayak Tradelink in the securities market is still in existence and imminent.   31. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from an unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from unregistered investment adviser vis-a-vis an investor who receives such service from a SEBI registered investment adviser stands at a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Prop. Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)    Page 17 of 23 under the IA Regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not even satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment adviser. Availing such services from unregistered entities is detrimental to investors and such unregistered service would result in irreparable damage as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victims of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury/ detriment to the development of the securities market also qualifies as an \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d. The objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market.  32. Further, if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may have to part with large fees and investments resulting into irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is the right of the current entity herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the ex-parte orders in the case of private suits and ex-parte public enforcement actions, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential deployment of funds by the investors by following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if, prima facie, unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing an ex-parte-interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favor of Vinayak Tradelink and its Proprietor, Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati.____________________________________________________________________________________________________", "Date": "2020-12-16", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Interim Order in the matter of Vinayak Tradelink (Proprietor Mr. Vivek Mahendragiri Ramdati)", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/dec-2020/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-vinayak-tradelink-proprietor-mr-vivek-mahendragiri-ramdati-_48465.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 57924, "unique_record_id": "c0571bb0b0SEBI20201216", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "66808d0e78589103064715e8", "parse_date": "2024-06-29 22:38:41", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Fraud - Unregistered", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "No financial penalties mentioned.", "gpt_audience": "1.

[ADJUDICATION ORDER NO. Order/BD/AB/2020-21/9850] UNDER SECTION 15-I OF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA ACT, 1992 READ WITH RULE 5 OF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA (PROCEDURE FOR HOLDING INQUIRY AND IMPOSING PENALTIES) RULES, 1995   In respect of:  Silver Stallion Ltd. PAN: AAICS7877A  FACTS OF THE CASE: 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) conducted investigation into the initial public offer of Birla Pacific Medspa Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBPML\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cthe Company\\\\\\\\u201d), for the period from July 7, 2011 to July 15, 2011 (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d), since there was high volatility on the day of listing.  2. Based on the findings of the investigation, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings against Silver Stallion Ltd. (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) under Section 15A(b) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d), for the alleged violation of Violation of Regulation 13(1) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cPIT Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) and Regulation 7(1) of the SEBI(Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cSAST Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d).  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 3. SEBI appointed the Shri D. Sura Reddy as the Adjudicating Officer under section 15 I of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (\\\\\\\\u201cAO Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge the aforesaid allegations under Section 15A(b) of the SEBIPage 2 of 7  Act on March 10, 2017. Subsequently, Shri Jeevan Sonaparote was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter after which the undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter on September 26, 2019.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 4. A Show Cause Notice dated April 20, 2017 (hereinafter be referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to the Noticee under Rule 4 of the AO Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated and penalty be not imposed under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act for the allegations as detailed in the said SCN.  5. The scrip of BPML was listed on BSE on July 7, 2011, after IPO which was open for subscription from June 20, 2011- June 23, 2011. It was observed that the Noticee was allotted 1,06,21,500 shares (9.47% shares) in the IPO of BPML. However, the requisite disclosure to the exchange and BPML were not made and hence it was alleged that the Noticee failed to make appropriate disclosures under Reg. 13(1) of the PIT Regulations and Reg. 7(1) of the SAST Regulations. 6. In terms of Regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations a disclosure in Form A has to be made to the company and to the Stock Exchange by any person who is holding more than 5% shares for any transaction which leads to a change in excess of 2% shareholding; and such disclosure has to be made within two working days of such change. Similarly, under Reg. 7(1)  r/w 7(2) of the SAST Regulations, a disclosure is required to be made with 2 days of acquisition of shares in excess of 5% to the company and the stock exchange.  7. The Noticee vide letter dated May 4, 2017 submitted its reply to the SCN stating that it was not aware that the allotment by BPML in IPO would result in acquisition of more than 5% shares. As a result, the Noticee inadvertently omitted to file the requisite disclosures.  8. Since the undersigned was appointed as AO subsequently, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on November 12, 2020 through email dated October 29, 2020. However, no response was received from the Noticee and on the scheduled date of hearing no one attended the hearing.Page 3 of 7   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES 9. I have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticee, its reply and the documents / material available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are : (a) Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 7(1) read with 7(2) of the SAST Regulations and Regulation 13(1) of the PIT Regulations? (b) Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act?  (c) If so, what would be the quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee after taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act?   10. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the PIT and SAST Regulations as below:  SAST Regulations Acquisition of 5% and more shares of a company 7.(1) Any acquirer, who acquires shares or voting rights which(taken together with shares or voting rights, if any, held by him) would entitle him to more than five per cent or ten per cent. or fourteen percent or fifty four per cent. or seventy four per cent shares or voting rights in a company, in any manner whatsoever, shall disclose at every stage the aggregate of his shareholding or voting rights in that company to the company and to the stock exchanges where shares of the target company are listed. \\\\\\\\u2026 (3) The disclosures mentioned in sub-regulations(1) and (1A) shall be made within two days, - (a) the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares; or (b) the acquisition of shares or voting rights, as the case may be.Page 4 of 7  PIT Regulations Disclosure of interest or holding in listed companies by certain persons - Initial Disclosure 13. (1) Any person who holds more than 5% shares or voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company in Form A, the number of shares or voting rights held by such person, on becoming such holder, within 2 working days of :\\\\\\\\u2014    (a) the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares; or  (b) the acquisition of shares or voting rights, as the case may be.  11. I find that the disclosure requirements under the PIT and SAST Regulations are triggered when the shareholding of an entity/ person crosses 5% of the share capital of that company. In the instant matter, I note from the data that the Noticee acquired 9.47% of the share capital of BPML. Consequently, the Noticee was required to make the disclosures to the Company and to BSE in the prescribed format within two working days of the allotment in terms of Regulation 7(1) read with Regulation 7(3) of the SAST Regulations and 13(1) of the PIT Regulations. I note that no such disclosures were made by the Noticee in the stipulated time frame and the same has also been admitted by the Noticee. The Noticee has submitted that since BPML did not inform it about allotment leading to acquisition of 5%, it did not make disclosures. This submission is not acceptable as the Noticee would have applied for allotment in the IPO of BPML and would be aware of the issue size. Once shares were allotted, the Noticee could itself find out that the allotment was in excess of 5%. Infact, the Noticee was allotted 9.47% shares which is a huge number and thus, it cannot be said that the Noticee wasn\\\\\\\\u2019t aware of its holding in BPML.  12. In this context, I observe that the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT has consistently held that the obligation to make the disclosures within the stipulated time is a mandatory obligation and penalty is imposed for non-compliance with the mandatory obligation. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in its Order dated September 30, 2014, in the matter of Akriti Global Traders Ltd. Vs SEBI had observed that  \\\\\\\\u201cObligation to make disclosures under the provisions contained in SAST Regulations, 2011 as also under PIT Regulations, 1992 would arise as soonPage 5 of 7  as there is acquisition of shares by a person in excess of the limits prescribed under the respective regulations and it is immaterial as to how the shares are acquired. Therefore, irrespective of the fact as to whether the shares were purchased from open market or shares were received on account of amalgamation or by way of bonus shares, if, as a result of such acquisition/ receipt, percentage of shares held by that person exceeds the limits prescribed under the respective regulations, then, it is mandatory to make disclosures under those regulations.\\\\\\\\u201d 13. I further observe that the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India, in the matter of Chairman, SEBI vs. Shriram Mutual Fund {[2006]} 5 SCC 361} held that:  \\\\\\\\u201cIn our view, the penalty is attracted as soon as contravention of the statutory obligations as contemplated by the Act is established and, therefore, the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes immaterial .... Hence, we are of the  view  that  once  the  contravention  is  established,  then  the  penalty  has  to follow and only the quantum of penalty is discretionary\\\\\\\\u201d. 14. In view of the violation of the provisions of law by the Noticee, as established above, the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under the provisions of Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, which reads as under : Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. 15A. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made there under-  (b)To file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefore in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less.  15. In this regard, the provisions of Section 15J of the SEBI Act and Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules require that while adjudging the quantum of penalty, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely; - (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.Page 6 of 7   16. With regard to the above factors to be considered while determining the quantum of penalty, it may be noted that the concerned department of SEBI has not quantified the profit/loss for the violations committed by the Noticee. No quantifiable figures or data are made available on record to assess the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage and amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default of the Noticee. Further, there is nothing on record to show that the default by the Noticee was repetitive in nature. As a mitigating factor, I also note that the Company while making disclosure of shareholding on the exchange after the IPO in July, 2011 for the quarter ending has shown the name of the Noticee (in the category of public shareholder holding more than 1% shareholding) along with its shareholding in the Company. Thus, I am inclined to consider that the information about Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s shareholding in the Company was in public domain from July, 2011.   17. I am also of the view that the disclosure requirements that have been prescribed under SAST and PIT Regulations are of utmost significance for the protection of interest of the investors, as such information received by them in a time bound manner would facilitate them to take an informed investment decision as regards their holdings in the Company. Further, the purpose of these disclosures is to bring about transparency in the transactions and to assist the Regulator to effectively monitor the transactions in the securities market.  ORDER 18. Having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, the material available on record, the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby impose a penalty of \\\\\\\\u20b93,00,000/- (Rupees Three Lakh only) on the Noticee viz. Silver Stallion Limited under the provisions of Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act.Page 7 of 7  19. I am of the view that the said penalty is commensurate with the lapse/omission on the part of the Noticee. The Noticee shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order, either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR by using the web link https://siportal.sebi.gov.in/intermediary/AOPaymentGateway.html 20. The Noticee shall forward said Demand Draft to the Enforcement Department \\\\\\\\u2013 Division of Regulatory Action\\\\\\\\u2013 IV of SEBI. The Noticee shall provide the following details while forwarding the Demand Draft: i. Name and PAN of the entity (Noticee) ii. Name of the case / matter iii. Purpose of Payment \\\\\\\\u2013 Payment of penalty under AO proceedings iv. Bank Name and Account Number  v. Transaction Number 21. Copies of this Adjudication Order are being sent to the Noticee and also to SEBI in terms of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules.   Date: December 16, 2020                        B.J.

Ltd. ___________________________________________________________________________ FACTS OF THE CASE IN BRIEF 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) received a letter dated September 19, 2019 from Vistara ITCL (India) Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u2018Vistara\\\\\\\\u2019), a SEBI registered Debenture Trustee in which Vistara had provided a list of companies from which it had not received till that date the Half Yearly Communication (\\\\\\\\u2018HYC\\\\\\\\u2019) as per Regulation 52(4) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, (\\\\\\\\u2018LODR Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019) for the half year ended March 31, 2019. The aforesaid list of companies included Sinew Developers Pvt. Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u2018Noticee/Company\\\\\\\\u2019). In view of the aforesaid information, SEBI conducted an examination and had observed prima facie violation of Regulations 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations by the Noticee.   APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  2. The undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer (\\\\\\\\u2018AO\\\\\\\\u2019) vide order dated June 10, 2020, under Section 19 read with Section 15-I of Securities and Exchange Board of India, 1992 (hereinafter, \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and under Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter, Rules) to enquire into and adjudge under Adjudication Order in respect of Sinew Developers Pvt.

Page 2 of 19        Section 15A(b) the alleged violations of Regulations 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations by the Noticee.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 3. A Show Cause Notice dated August 28, 2020 (hereinafter, \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued by the AO to the Noticee under Rule 4 of the Rules, calling it to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against it and penalty be not imposed on it under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act for the violations as specified in the SCN and reproduced herein below: (a) Failure to submit financial results of the company for the half year ended March 31, 2019 to the exchange, which is not in compliance of Regulation 52(1) of the LODR Regulations. (b) Failure to disclose the line items as specified under the Regulation 52(4) of LODR Regulations to the exchange. (c) Failure to submit the certificate signed by the Debenture Trustee taking note of the contents prescribed under Regulation 52(4) of LODR Regulations to the exchange, thereby non-compliance with Regulation 52(5) of LODR Regulations. 4. In response to this, the Noticee vide its email dated September 07, 2020 requested for inspection of all the documents that would undermine the charges against the Noticee. In this regard, vide email dated September 11, 2020, the Noticee was informed that all the relied upon information and documents to substantiate the allegations in respect of the Noticee, have already been provided to the Noticee along with the SCN and there are no other information and records being relied upon in respect of the Noticee in the present matter.  5. Further, vide the said email, the Noticee was asked to submit its reply to the SCN latest by September 21, 2020 and also an opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticee on September 24, 2020. However, the Noticee vide its email dated September 18, 2020 again requested to undertake an inspection of documents relied upon by the undersigned. Adjudication Order in respect of Sinew Developers Pvt. Ltd.                                                                             Page 3 of 19        6. In this regard, vide email dated September 24, 2020, the Noticee was informed that its request for inspection of documents has been rejected by the undersigned as all relevant and relied upon documents have already been provided to it. Further, vide the said email, another opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticee October 06, 2020, which was rescheduled on October 13, 2020 on the request of the Noticee. 7. Subsequently, the Noticee vide its email dated October 10, 2020 submitted its reply to the SCN, which is summarized as below: a. \\\\\\\\u201cThe SCN is based upon various documents and these documents are not inspected by us and without the inspection of these documents, we would be seriously prejudiced and handicapped in preparing an effective reply. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in Kothari Filaments V/s. CCE 2009(2) SCC 192 has indicated that non supply of documents would violate principles of natural justice and vitiate adjudication.    b. The debentures issued by the Company were by way of a private placement and this was not a public issue of debentures that could have been subscribed by the public at large. While the Series- A debentures were listed, Ammon at all relevant times was and continues to be the debenture holder for the Series A and C Debentures;  c. At all relevant times, the Company was controlled by the debenture holder and this was part of the debenture subscription agreement entered into between the Company, Ammon and the promoters pursuant to which Ammon acquired the rights ordinarily reserved for a shareholder. Ammon had special rights conferred on it in respect of certain matters (hereinafter \\\\\\\\u201cReserved Matters\\\\\\\\u201d) under a debenture subscription agreement that inter-alia include: (a) the right to appoint a majority of directors on the Board of the Company; (b) affirmative voting rights on reserved matters that pertinently extended to approval of accounts; and (c) special quorum requirements for conducting a meeting of the Board i.e. the presence of at least one nominee director of Ammon, was necessary for a valid quorum to be constituted. The terms on which Ammon subscribed to the debentures including the special rights are publicly disclosed and available in the Information Memorandum/ shelf disclosure documents filed with the BSE Ltd; Adjudication Order in respect of Sinew Developers Pvt. Ltd.                                                                             Page 4 of 19         d. The Articles of the Company were also amended to incorporate the terms of the debenture subscription agreement and provided that the Company shall not take any action in relation to the Reserved Matters, unless they are approved by a nominee director of the debenture holder prior to being taken up at the Board meeting and, thereafter, approved at the Board meeting of the Company, where the nominees of the debenture holder are in a majority;  e. The record shows that owing to disputes between the Company, Ammon and the promoters which are sub-judice and pending before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court, no Board meeting has been convened, owing to Ammon\\\\\\\\u2019s nominees refusing to provide their consent \\\\\\\\u2013since their presence is necessary for a valid quorum to be constituted, let alone for approving the accounts of the Company. Attempts of the Company Secretary to convene a meeting of the Board was thwarted. This has resulted in the Company being unable to table the accounts at the general meeting, for the financial year 2017-18 onwards;  f. The failure to obtain approval of the accounts for the financial year 2017-18 has had a cascading effect, on the accounts for the subsequent financial year i.e. 2018-19 i.e. for the year ended March 31, 2019 \\\\\\\\u2013 which too have not been tabled before the Board and consequently, the shareholders, for want of consent from the nominee directors of Ammon;  g. It is well settled that unless the financial statements of the company are approved by the Board of Directors and thereafter placed before the shareholders for their approval, the information contained in unapproved financial statements of the company has no legal sanctity;  h. Regulation 52(1) of the LODR Regulations, requires a listed entity to \\\\\\\\u201cprepare and submit un-audited or audited financial results on a half yearly basis\\\\\\\\u201d within 45 days. Obviously, the financial results \\\\\\\\u2013 whether audited or unaudited would have to first be approved and taken on record by the Board of Directors and signed by the managing director or executive director. This is made abundantly clear by Regulation 52(2(b) of the LODR Regulations;  i. Admittedly, the financial results of the Company for the financial year 2017-18 onwards have not been approved by the Board of Directors let alone the shareholders, owing to the failure by the Adjudication Order in respect of Sinew Developers Pvt. Ltd.                                                                             Page 5 of 19        debenture holder to provide their consent to convene a Board meeting. Therefore, the obligation to make disclosures of the financial statements are conditional upon their being approved at a meeting of the Board;  j. Consequently, when no Board meeting has been convened and held, owing to the failure of the debenture holder to act reasonably, the Company cannot be held liable for alleged failure to file the half yearly financial results. A similar issue was considered by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in State of Andhra Pradesh & Another v. Andhra Provincial Potteries Ltd. (1973) 2 SCC 786 where the issue before the Court was whether directors can be penalized for failure to file the financial statements with the Registrar of Companies, when an annual general meeting of the shareholders was not convened to approve the financial statements. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court upheld the view expressed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Andhra Pradesh High Court that the obligation to file the financial statements with the Registrar of Companies, under Section 220 of the Companies Act, 1956, can arise only after the annual general meeting is convened and the financial statements are placed before them and not otherwise. Similarly, the obligation to disclose financial statements under Regulation 52(1) of the LODR Regulations can arise only where they are approved by the Board of Directors and the shareholders, as the case may be;  k. Moreover, it is well settled that the law does not compel the performance of an act which has become impossible i.e. in the instant case owing to Ammon\\\\\\\\u2019s conduct in not consenting to a meeting to approve the accounts. Reference is made to the judgement of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in Jaswal Neco Limited v Commissioner of Customs (20150 17 SCC 769) where the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court held that difficulties or impossibilities that prevented compliance with statutory obligations, would excuse such a person from penalties;   l. The disclosures in question under the LODR Regulations are aimed at protecting the interests of the debenture holders, who are beneficiaries of these provisions, by providing them, with information on the financial position of the issuer, to enable them to make an informed decision. However, when the beneficiary or protectee of the law is itself is in charge of the issuer and has been responsible for thwarting compliance and has not approved the financial results \\\\\\\\u2013 it is a vital facet that ought to Adjudication Order in respect of Sinew Developers Pvt. Ltd.                                                                             Page 6 of 19        weigh with SEBI, in excusing any alleged non-compliance. It would be erroneous for SEBI to take the view that every infraction, no matter how genuine, warrants penal intervention. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in Piramal Enterprises v SEBI (Appeal No. 466 of 2016, Order dated May 15, 2019) has categorically held that imposition of penalty is not the ultimate purpose of the SEBI Act and substituted the penalty with a warning, when the alleged violation was venial and technical.  m. The SCN is based upon various documents and these documents are not inspected by us and without the inspection of these documents, we would be seriously prejudiced and handicapped in preparing an effective reply. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in Kothari Filaments V/s. CCE 2009(2) SCC 192 has indicated that non supply of documents would violate principles of natural justice and vitiate adjudication.    n. Later on, a board meeting of Company was called and to be convened on 30th November 2018 for approving the audited financial statements for the year 2017-2018, however, the nominee directors of Ammon on the Board of Company deliberately neither confirmed nor attended such meeting due to which the audited financial statements could not be approved. Since the Board Meeting was not held and consequently Ammons directors did not approve the financials for the year 2017-2018 and consequently the AGM could not be held and due this the audited financials were not available for filing. A copy of the correspondence addressed by the Company Secretary to Ammon calling for the board meeting is annexed hereto and marked as Annexure-Q. Due to this very reason the half yearly communication and audited financials for financial years 2018 was not submitted.   o. By and under two emails dated 6th December 2018 and 20th December 2018 addressed by Rakesh Shah, a nominee director of Ammon to the Company Secretary of Company, Ammon has sought to allege, inter-alia, that the board meeting was not properly convened by the Company Secretary as an afterthought to cover up their failure to attend the board meeting on 30th November 2018.   p. Thereafter, on several occasions, the Company Secretary of Company requested that Board Meetings should be convened as several compliances were required. However, the nominee directors did not Adjudication Order in respect of Sinew Developers Pvt. Ltd.                                                                             Page 7 of 19        make themselves available for Board meeting. Due to this omission on part of Ammon and its nominee directors, a situate of impasse has been created.   q. In view of the aforesaid it is clear that due to the abject non-cooperation from the nominee directors of Ammon/ Xander since 2015 which led to delays in completion of the Project and consequently led to disruption in the management of the Company. The Company despite holding the board meetings, several resolutions including approval and filing of financials of the Company have not been passed and could not be carried further.  r. Further, from the aforesaid it is evident that that no losses have been caused to the investor nor has any disproportionate gain or unfair advantage derived to the Company as a result of any purported defaults.  8. Subsequently, hearing in the matter was conducted on October 13, 2020. The said hearing was attended by the Authorized Representatives (\\\\\\\\u2018AR\\\\\\\\u2019) of the Noticee in which they reiterated their submissions made vide its earlier replies and as per the request of the Noticee, additional time of one week was provided to the Noticee to make additional submissions in the matter (if any). 9. The Noticee vide its letter dated October 19, 2020 made further submissions in the matter which is summarized as below: i. The disclosures under Regulation 52 of the LODR Regulations of the financial results and other information - are aimed at protecting the interests of the debenture holders, who are beneficiaries of these provisions, by providing them, with information on the financial position of the issuer, to enable them to make an informed decision;   ii. In the present case, admittedly \\\\\\\\u2013 there were only two debenture holders \\\\\\\\u2013 Ammon and KUDPL. The NCDs were fully subscribed by these two entities and were not transferred to any other entity and were not available to the public for purchase. Ammon, the beneficiary or protectee of the law is itself is in charge of the issuer and has been responsible for thwarting compliance and has not approved the financial results. Adjudication Order in respect of Sinew Developers Pvt. Ltd.                                                                             Page 8 of 19        It would inequitable and contrary to the spirit of these provisions, for the Noticee to be held liable, in such a case;   iii. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in National Highway Authority of India vs SEBI (Appeal No. 232 of 2020 Order dated August 27, 2020 @ Page No. 516-531), involving a similar charge of non-disclosure of financial results under Regulation 52(1) of the LODR Regulations, for two financial years for which SEBI imposed a penalty of Rs 7 lakhs, substituted the penalty with a warning. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT took into account the extraordinary circumstances that excused non-compliance. While the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT also stated that its judgement ought not to be treated as a precedent, it would be open to the Learned Adjudicating Officer to take into account the extraordinary facts in the present case as well, and drop these proceedings with a warning;   iv. Regulation 52(1) of the LODR Regulations, requires a listed entity to \\\\\\\\u201cprepare and submit un-audited or audited financial results on a half yearly basis\\\\\\\\u201d within 45 days. The financial results \\\\\\\\u2013 whether audited or unaudited, would have to first be approved and taken on record by the Board of Directors and signed by the managing director or executive director (See Regulation 52(2)(b) of the LODR Regulations). The obligation to disclose financial statements under Regulation 52(1) of the LODR Regulations can arise only when they are approved by the Board of Directors and the shareholders, as the case may be. The obligation is therefore conditional;   v. When a meeting of the shareholders or the Board, as the case may be, is not convened and the financial statements are not approved, no penalty can be imposed for failure to file the financial results (See Para 6 and 7 of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court\\\\\\\\u2019s judgement in State of Andhra Pradesh & Another v. Andhra Provincial Potteries Ltd. (1973) 2 SCC 786 @ Page No. 532-538);  vi. It is well settled that the law does not compel the performance of an act which has become impossible. In the instant case, the failure to file financial results is attributable to the debenture holder\\\\\\\\u2019s conduct in not approving the financial statements, despite the bona-fide conduct of the officers of the Company and the promoter. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in Jaswal Neco Limited v Commissioner of Customs (2015 17 Adjudication Order in respect of Sinew Developers Pvt. Ltd.                                                                             Page 9 of 19        SCC 769 @ Page No. 539-558) held that difficulties or impossibilities that prevented compliance with statutory obligations, would excuse such a person from penalties (See Para 37);   vii. Lastly, no useful purpose would be served by imposing a penalty, when the beneficiary of the disclosure provisions in question, itself is in charge of the affairs of the issuer, had access to the information in question and has prevented compliance. A mandatory penalty regardless of circumstances would be unconstitutional and not in accordance with SEBI Act. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in Piramal Enterprises v SEBI (Appeal No. 466 of 2016, Order dated May 15, 2019 @ Page No. 559-589) categorically held that imposition of penalty is not the ultimate purpose of the SEBI Act and substituted the penalty with a warning, when the alleged violation was venial and technical (See Paras 24-26).    10. Taking into account the aforesaid facts, I am of the view that principle of natural justice has been followed in the matter by granting the Noticee ample opportunities for replying to the SCN and of being heard. Therefore, I deem it appropriate to decide the matter on the basis of facts/material available on record and replies submitted by the Noticee.   ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS 11. I have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case and the material available on record and the issues that arise for consideration in the present case are: a. Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of the LODR Regulations?  b. Does the violation, if any, on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under Section 15 A(b) of the SEBI Act? c. If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15 J of the SEBI Act? Adjudication Order in respect of Sinew Developers Pvt.

Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of LODR Regulations, which reads as under: Regulation 52(1) \\\\\\\\u201cThe listed entity shall prepare and submit un-audited or audited financial results on a half yearly basis in the format as specified by the Board within forty-five days from the end of the half year to the recognised stock exchange(s).

FINDINGS 13. Before going into the merits of the case, I would like to deal with the preliminary contention raised by the Noticee with regard to supply and inspection of documents. The Noticee has contended that it had sought the entire record relating to the investigation carried out by SEBI, including the complete Investigation Report and all documents/emails referred to in such Investigation Report. The Noticee has further contended that they should have been permitted to undertake an inspection of documents including those relied upon by the undersigned. In this regard, the Noticee has quoted the judgements of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Adjudication Order in respect of Sinew Developers Pvt. Ltd.                                                                             Page 12 of 19        Court in the matter of Pricewaterhouse v Securities and Exchange Board of India. In the present matter, the said SCN inter-alia contains the allegation that the Noticee being a listed entity has failed to make required disclosures under Regulations 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations. I note that the allegations against the Noticee are clearly delineated in the SCN and all the relevant documents that have been relied upon in the SCN have been provided to the Noticee as enclosures to the SCN. I note that in the present proceeding reliance is being placed on only those documents, which have been provided to the Noticee. Further, I note that the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, in its order dated February 12, 2020, in the matter of Shruti Vora vs. SEBI had made the following observations:  \"Reliance was also made of a decision of the Supreme Court in Union of India and Others vs E. Bashyan (1988) 2 SCC 196 which has no bearing to the controversy involved in the present context, in as much as, the said decision relates to a disciplinary proceedings wherein the Supreme Court observed that the inquiry report was required to be made available to the delinquent. An inquiry report is totally distinct and different from an investigation report. The inquiry report considers all the materials in the inquiry proceedings which form the basis of the final order and therefore the said report is required to be made available to the delinquent. In the instant case, the show cause notice relies upon certain documents which have been made available. Thus the investigation report is not required to be supplied\\\\\\\\u201d. \"The learned counsel has also placed reliance upon a minority view of this Tribunal in Price Waterhouse vs Securities and Exchange Board of India decided by this Tribunal in Appeal No. 8 of 2011 on June 1, 2011 wherein it was observed that fairness demands that the entire material collected during the course of investigation should be made available for inspection to the person whose conduct was in question and hat said material should also be supplied. In our opinion, the said minority view is directly against the decision of the Supreme Court in Natwar Singh case (supra)\\\\\\\\u201d. \"A bare reading of the provisions of the Act and the Rules as referred to above do not provide supply of documents upon which no reliance has been placed by the AO, nor even the principles of natural justice require supply of such documents which has not been relied upon by the AO. We are of the opinion that we cannot compel the AO to deviate from the prescribed procedure and supply of such documents which is not warranted in law. In our view, on a reading of the Act and the Rules we find that there is no duty cast upon Adjudication Order in respect of Sinew Developers Pvt. Ltd.                                                                             Page 13 of 19        the AO to disclose or provide all the documents in his possession especially when such documents are not being relied upon.\\\\\\\\u201d 14. Further, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Anant R Sathe Vs SEBI (Appeal No. 150  of  2020)  vide  Order  dated  July  17,  2020  has  reaffirmed  the  principle elucidated in the judgment of Shruti Vora\\\\\\\\u2019s case, which was reproduced herein above and ruled that \\\\\\\\u201cthe Authority is required to supply the documents that they rely  upon while  serving  the  show  cause  notice  which  in  the  instant  case  has been done and which is sufficient for the purpose of filing an efficacious reply in his defence\\\\\\\\u201d. 15. In view of the above, since all the documents which are relevant and relied upon in the instant proceedings have been provided to the Noticee, I am of the opinion that principles of natural justice have been duly complied with in the instant proceedings and no prejudice in filing reply has been caused to the Noticee. 16. The first issue for consideration is whether the Noticee has violated Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. 17. It may be noted that Regulation 52(1) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations provides for submission of the financial results within forty-five days from the end of the half year. Further, Regulation 52(4) provides for disclosure of certain line items along with the half yearly / annual financial results, while Regulation 52(5) provides for submission of a Certificate signed by the Debenture Trustee taking note of the contents prescribed under Regulation 52(4). 18. From the fact of the case, I observe that in pursuance of the reference of Vistra, SEBI sought information from Exchanges (NSE and BSE) regarding the compliance status of the Noticee with respect to Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations for the half year ended March 31, 2019. From the submissions of the BSE vide its email dated October 07, 2019 and March 11, 2020, it was observed that the company has not complied with provisions of Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015. Adjudication Order in respect of Sinew Developers Pvt. Ltd.                                                                             Page 14 of 19        19. The Noticee in its reply has submitted that at all relevant times, the Company was controlled by the debenture holder of the company, and this was part of the debenture subscription agreement entered into between the Company, its promoters and Debenture holder of the company (\\\\\\\\u2018Ammon\\\\\\\\u2019), pursuant to which Ammon acquired the rights ordinarily reserved for a shareholder. The Noticee further submitted that Ammon had special rights conferred on it in respect of certain matters (hereinafter \\\\\\\\u201cReserved Matters\\\\\\\\u201d) under the said agreement that inter-alia included: (a) the right to appoint a majority of directors on the Board of the Company; (b) affirmative voting rights on reserved matters that pertinently extended to approval of accounts; and (c) special quorum requirements for conducting a meeting of the Board i.e. the presence of at least one nominee director of Ammon, was necessary for a valid quorum to be constituted etc. 20. Further, the Noticee submitted that they had failed to make relevant disclosures as the financial results of the Company for the financial year 2017-18 onwards have not been approved by the Board of Directors, owing to the failure by the debenture holder of the company to provide its consent to convene a Board meeting. Therefore, the Noticee had contended that as the Board meeting could not be convened owing to the failure of the debenture holder to act reasonably, the Company cannot be held liable for alleged failure to file the half yearly financial results.  21. In this regard, I note that the aforementioned rights on Reserved Matters including right to appoint majority of directors on the Board of the company, convening the Board meeting etc. was given to Ammon by the company and its promoters themselves after entering into aforesaid agreement. Hence, I note that the procedural difficulties faced by the company in convening of Board meeting and filing the said disclosures due to non-cooperation by debenture holder of the company is their internal matter which does not absolve the Noticee from filing the said disclosures under LODR Regulations. In this regard, I further note that a listed entity is required to comply with the relevant Regulations/directions issued by SEBI from time to time. In the instant matter, the provision of said Regulation does not give any relaxation from complying with the same for any procedural challenges like this. Therefore, I do not accept this contention of the Noticee. Adjudication Order in respect of Sinew Developers Pvt. Ltd.

Mr. Prakash Shyamlal Rathod)  Page 8 of 17 7.5 From the narrative of the credit transactions in the Bank accounts, it appears that the payments have, prima facie, come from various investors / clients.  8. Considering the above analysis of the details on the website of Agrich and information from the accounts opened with the Banks mentioned above, I, prima facie, observe that Agrich has represented that it is an investment advisory firm for advice on stocks and commodity markets.  9. Considering the above facts and circumstances, especially the contents of the website of Agrich coupled with the credit transactions in the Bank Accounts as detailed in preceding paragraphs, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees/ funds credited to the Bank Accounts, were for the purpose of providing the services indicated on the website of Agrich. Hence, as reflected in the bank statements referred to above, I note that Agrich has commenced with the collection of fees/ funds for the purpose of providing the services from October 2019 and has continued the same at least till the period of examination.  10. It is, prima facie, observed that Agrich was placing information in public domain/ advertising by using its website www.agrichtraders.com about various services offered by him in the securities market. Further, it is also, prima facie, observed that various packages were being offered by Agrich through its website to avail its services. The website categorically mentioned \\\\\\\\u201cthe advantages of availing its services in various fields of securities market\\\\\\\\u201d and the \\\\\\\\u201cindependent advice\\\\\\\\u201d they offer to their clients in the securities market through telephone calls.   11. In this factual matrix, I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Agrich Traders (Prop. Mr. Prakash Shyamlal Rathod)  Page 9 of 17 products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d   12. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is observed from the contents of the website of Agrich that the Agrich is holding itself out as investment adviser by prima facie offering to provide investment advice as defined under regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations by offering to give advice related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription. Further, as noted from the bank accounts that there are multiple credit entries which when seen together with the contents of the websites lead to, on preponderance of probability basis, a prima facie conclusion that the credit entries in the bank accounts are consideration for the investment advice given by Agrich to its clients. Thus, prima facie Agrich is an investment adviser as defined under regulation 2 (m) of IA Regulations.  13. Therefore, Agrich has not only held itself out as an investment adviser but has also acted as an investment adviser for consideration.  Issue No.2: If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether Agrich has, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act read with IA Regulations?  14. In order to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Agrich Traders (Prop. Mr. Prakash Shyamlal Rathod)  Page 10 of 17 buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  Further, as per Regulation 3(1) of  the  SEBI  (Investment  Advisers)  Regulations,  2013 (hereinafter referred to as the IA Regulations), the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.  15. The activities of Agrich, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that Agrich is holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser. However, no material is available on record to indicate that Agrich, or its proprietor Mr. Prakash Shyamlal Rathod are holding a certificate of registration as an investment adviser. In this context, it is noted that Agrich or its proprietor Mr. Prakash Shyamlal Rathod in their individual capacity are not registered with SEBI in any capacity. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by Agrich, as discussed in the  preceding  issue,  prima  facie,  leads  to  the  conclusion  that Agrich is holding itself  out  and  acting  as  an  investment  adviser  without  a  certificate  of registration.  16. In my view, these activities/ representations without holding the certificate of registration as investment adviser is prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.  Issue No. 3: If answers to Issue Nos. (1) & (2) are affirmative, who are all responsible for the violations?  17. I note that Mr. Prakash Shyamlal Rathod is the sole proprietor of Agrich. I note the legal status of a proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme court in Ashok__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Agrich Traders (Prop. Mr. Prakash Shyamlal Rathod)  Page 11 of 17 Transport Agency v. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567], wherein it was stated that:  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026..A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business. . A suit by or against a proprietary concern is by or against the proprietor of the business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d.  18. Therefore, I find that Mr. Prakash Shyamlal Rathod is liable for the acts of Agrich.  Issue No. 4: If answer to Issue No. (2) is affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any should be issued against those responsible for the violations?  19. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market.  Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of regulating Investment Advisory Services to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of such activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations, inter alia, seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the criteria set out in the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market.  20. In the instant case, Agrich is soliciting and inducing the investors to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration/certification as mandated under the IA Regulations. Further, it is noted from material available on record of that, the money has been credited to the Bank accounts of Agrich and its proprietor as recent as December 2020. Thus, the accounts are active and can continue to be used to collect fees from unsuspecting investors.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Agrich Traders (Prop. Mr. Prakash Shyamlal Rathod)  Page 12 of 17  21. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter  and  to  take immediate  steps  to  prevent  Agrich from  collecting any more  fees from  the  public  and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. I note that the investors can also reach Agrich  (9876543210) through telephone also. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Agrich in the securities market is still in existence and imminent. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Agrich is Rs.1.26 crores and the same indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.   22. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from the unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from unregistered investment advisor vis-a-vis an investor who receives such service from a registered investment adviser in consonance with the IA Regulations stands at a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged under the IA regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not even satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment adviser.  Availing of services from such persons is detrimental to investors and such unqualified service would result in irreparable damage as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested   based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victims of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury/detriment to the development of the securities market also qualifies as an \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d. The objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market.  23. Further if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may have to part with large fees and investments resulting into irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is right of the current entity__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Agrich Traders (Prop. Mr. Prakash Shyamlal Rathod)  Page 13 of 17 herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the ex-parte orders in the case of private suits and ex-parte public enforcement actions, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential loss of investment by the investors by following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if prima facie unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing an exparte-interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favour of the entity.      24. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Agrich and its proprietor from collecting any more fees from the public and from indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities.   25. I note that the amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Agrich is Rs.1.26 crores and indicate the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors. In light of the same, I find that there is no other alternative but to take recourse through an interim ex-parte order against Agrich and its proprietor Mr. Prakash Rathod for preventing them from collecting funds by defrauding investors and by indulging in unauthorized investment advisory services without obtaining the mandatory registrations from SEBI in accordance with the law. As the bank accounts of Agrich are active, the balance of convenience demands the preventive measure of stopping the collection of money in the bank accounts of Agrich and its Proprietor from investors. The same can be effectively achieved by an appropriate direction of stopping the credit into the bank accounts of Agrich and its proprietor. As Agrich and its proprietor have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, the balance of convenience also demands that Agrich and its proprietor need to be prevented from diverting the funds__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Agrich Traders (Prop. Mr. Prakash Shyamlal Rathod)  Page 14 of 17 collected from the investors through the fraudulent and unauthorized investment advisory activity. Accordingly, an appropriate direction stopping the debit from the bank accounts of Agrich and its proprietor has been incorporated.  26. With the initiation of quasi-judicial proceedings, given the fact that Agrich and its proprietor have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, it is imminent that the Noticee may divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients. The same may result in defeating the effective implementation of the direction of refund, if any, to be passed after deciding the matter on merits. It therefore becomes necessary for SEBI to take urgent steps to prevent Noticee from diverting the money collected from the subscribers / clients. It is also essential to take urgent steps to prevent them from alienating any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets, so that the final remedies, if any, do not become infructuous. In view of the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove, and considering the interests of already existing clients of these Noticee and also the interests of those who may fall prey to the unregistered investment advisory by reaching him through the telephone calls, the balance of convenience lies against the Noticee, and requires immediate action against him including not to divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients / investors.  Order  27. In view of the above, pending conclusion of enquiry on granting of hearing opportunity to Agrich and its proprietor Mr. Prakash Shyamlal Rathod, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me by virtue of Section 19 read with Sections 11, 11(4), 11B(1) and 11D read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992, hereby issue by way of this interim ex-parte order, the following directions:   27.1  Agrich and its proprietor Mr. Prakash Shyamlal Rathod are directed to:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Agrich Traders (Prop.

From the narrative of the transactions, it appears that the payments have, prima facie, come from various investors / clients.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of VRP Capital & Derivative Market Services Page 7 of 16 8. In light of the aforesaid discussions, I prima facie observe, from the contents of VRP Capital\\\\\\\\u2019s website wherein various services offered by VRP Capital has been described, that it is prima facie holding itself out as an investment adviser. As per the website of VRP Capital which is active as on date, and from the investor complaints, it is noted that VRP Capital offered various tips / services to its clients in the securities market through emails, SMSs. Further, VRP Capital is also providing services through Yahoo Messenger and WhatsApp. Considering the above facts and circumstances, especially the content of the website of VRP Capital coupled with the credit transactions in the bank accounts and through the payment gateway, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees / funds credited to the bank accounts and by payment gateway, were for the purpose of availing the services indicated on the website of VRP Capital.   8.1 In this factual context, I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d   8.2 In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is observed from the contents of the website of the VRP Capital that it is holding itself out as an investment adviser by prima facie offering to provide investment advice as defined under regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations by offering to give advice related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription. Further, as noted from the bank accounts there are multiple credit entries which when seen together with the contents of the websites lead to a prima facie conclusion that the credit entries in the bank accounts are consideration for the investment advice given by VRP Capital to its clients. Thus, prima__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of VRP Capital & Derivative Market Services Page 8 of 16 facie the VRP Capital is an investment adviser as defined under regulation 2 (m) of IA Regulations.  8.3 Therefore, the activity of VRP Capital by virtue of its website contents amounts to  holding itself to be giving trading tips, stock specific recommendations, etc., to the investors and general public. The fact of the receipt of money in the bank statements, prima facie, shows, on preponderance of probability basis, that the credit for payment of fees is in fact meant for the advisory services actually rendered by VRP Capital. Therefore, VRP Capital has not only held itself out as an investment adviser but  also is acting  as an investment adviser for consideration.  Issue No.2: If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether VRP Capital has, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act) read with IA Regulations?  9. In order to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out  investment  advisory  activities  has  to  necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  Further, as per Regulation 3(1) of  the  SEBI  (Investment  Advisers)  Regulations,  2013 (hereinafter referred to as the IA Regulations), the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of VRP Capital & Derivative Market Services Page 9 of 16 person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.  10. The activities of VRP Capital, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that VRP Capital is holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser. However, no material is available on record to indicate that VRP Capital or its proprietor Mr.Vaibhav Ramachandra Patil are holding a certificate of registration as an investment adviser. In this context, it is noted that VRP Capital or its proprietor Mr.Vaibhav Ramachandra Patil in their individual capacity are not registered with  SEBI  in  any capacity. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by VRP Capital, as discussed in the  preceding  issue,  prima  facie,  coupled with its own admission on the website that they are not registered as an investment adviser leads  to  the  conclusion  that VRP Capital is holding itself  out  and  acting  as  an  investment  adviser  without  a  certificate  of registration.  11. In my view, these activities/ representations without holding the certificate of registration as investment adviser is prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.  Issue No. 3: If answers to Issue Nos. (1) & (2) are affirmative, who is responsible for the violations? 12. I note that Mr.Vaibhav Ramachandra Patil is the sole proprietor of VRP Capital. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme court in Ashok Transport Agency v. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business. . A suit by or against a proprietary concern  is  by  or  against  the  proprietor  of  the  business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Mr.Vaibhav Ramachandra Patil is liable for the acts of VRP Capital.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of VRP Capital & Derivative Market Services Page 10 of 16 Issue No. 4: If answer to Issue No.  (2) is affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any should be issued against those responsible for the violations?  13. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market.  Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of regulating Investment Advisory Services to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of such activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations, inter alia, seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the criteria set out in the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market.  14. In the instant case, VRP Capital, its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil is soliciting and inducing the investors to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration/certification as mandated under the IA Regulations. Further, it is noted from material available on record of that, the website is active as on date and money has been credited to the Bank accounts of VRP Capital even as recent as December 2020. Thus, the account is active and can continue to be used to collect fees from unsuspecting investors.    15. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and  to  take immediate  steps  to  prevent  VRP Capital, its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil from  collecting any more  fees from  the  public  and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. I note that the website is active as on date and the investors can also reach VRP Capital through telephone, Yahoo Messenger, WhatsApp also. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of VRP Capital, its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil in the securities market is still in existence and imminent. The amount of__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of VRP Capital & Derivative Market Services Page 11 of 16 money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by VRP Capital is Rs. 2,58,05,574 /- and the same indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.   16. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from the unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from registered investment advisor in consonance with the IA Regulations visa-vis an investor who receives such service from unregistered investment adviser stands at a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged under the IA regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment adviser. Availing of service from such persons is detrimental to investors and such unqualified services results in irreparable detriment as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victim of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury/detriment to the development of the securities market also qualifies as an \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d. The objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market.   17. Further if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may have to part away with large fees and investments resulting into irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is right of the current entity herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the ex-parte orders in the case of private suits and ex-parte public enforcement actions, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential loss of investment by the investors by__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of VRP Capital & Derivative Market Services Page 12 of 16 following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if, prima facie, unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not  passing an ex-parte interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favour of the entity.     18. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent VRP Capital, its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil from collecting any more fees from the public and from indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. As noted in the preceding paragraphs, at least till the examination period, monies were being received in the bank account of VRP Capital and bank account is still active. Moreover, the website of VRP Capital is still active. The aforesaid prima facie demonstrates that VRP Capital, its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil can still lure investors to deal in the securities market while acting on its advice and probability of investors reaching it is still high. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of VRP Capital, its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil in the securities market is still in existence and imminent.  19. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by VRP Capital, its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil is Rs. 2,58,05,574/- and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors. In light of the same, I find that there is no other alternative but to take recourse through an interim ex-parte order against VRP Capital/ its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil for preventing it from collecting funds by indulging in unauthorized investment advisory services without obtaining the mandatory registrations from SEBI in accordance with the law. As the website and bank accounts of VRP Capital/ its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil is active and the investors can reach them through telephone/Yahoo Messenger/WhatsApp also, the balance of convenience demands the preventive measure of stopping the collection of money in the bank account of the VRP Capital/ its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil from investors. The same can be effectively achieved by an appropriate__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of VRP Capital & Derivative Market Services Page 13 of 16 direction of stopping the credit into the bank account of VRP Capital/ its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil. As VRP Capital, its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil has already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, the balance of convenience also demands that VRP Capital, its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil needs to be prevented from diverting the funds collected from the investors through the  unauthorized investment advisory activity. Accordingly, an appropriate direction stopping the debit from the bank account of VRP Capital, its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil has been incorporated. 20. With the initiation of quasi-judicial proceedings, VRP Capital and its Proprietor Vaibhav Patil have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser,  it is imminent that the Noticee may divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients. The same may result in defeating the effective implementation of the direction of refund, if any, to be passed after deciding the matter on merits. It therefore becomes necessary for SEBI to take urgent steps to prevent Noticee from diverting the money collected from the subscribers / clients. It is also essential to take urgent steps to prevent them from alienating any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets, so that the final remedies, if any, do not become infructuous. In view of the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove, and considering the interests of already existing clients of these Noticee and also the interests of those who may fall prey to the unregistered investment advisory by reaching it through the website or telephone/Yahoo Messenger/WhatsApp the balance of convenience lies against the Noticee, and requires immediate action against it including not to divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients / investors.  Order 21. In view of the above, pending detailed examination, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me by virtue of Section 19 read with Sections 11, 11(4), 11B(1) and 11D read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992, hereby issue by way of this interim ex-parte order, the following directions:   21.1VRP Capital and its sole Proprietor Vaibhav Patil are directed to:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of VRP Capital & Derivative Market Services Page 14 of 16  i.

However, as per Wood Star reply it sells dried seasoned wood to THL which is bought from Maloo Tradelink. Therefore, there was no conformity between the information provided by THL and Wood Star regarding transactions in between them. The statements made by THL and other entities regarding the buy and sale are contradictory.  c) Investigation further observed that THL is connected to Maloo Tradelink. As per MCA annual returns for the year 2011-12 these two entities share same registered office address at A-2 Harikrupa Apartment, Near Naranpura Rly. Crossing, Ahmedabad, Gujarat-380013. As per the annual return of the company the promoter directors of the Maloo Tradelink were Ajay Sureshchandra Maloo and Nina Ajay Maloo (wife of Ajay Sureshchandra Maloo). Ajay Sureshchandra Maloo is the brother of Anant Sureshchandra Maloo who is the promoter and Chairman & Managing Director of THL. Also, in the Annual Report of THL for the year 2010-11 and 2011-12 Maloo Tradelink is shown as related entity of THL.Final Order in the matter of IPO of Timbor Home Ltd. Page 11 of 53   d) Further, Wood Star and Timsy Trader are also connected. The address of Wood Star as per MCA returns for the year 2010-11 is at 201, 202, 203 Pavan Plaza, Near S P Statue Naranpura,  Ahmedabad-380013 and the address of Timsy traders is 202 Pavan Plaza, Near S P Statue Naranpura,  Ahmedabad-380013. As per annual returns filed with MCA for the year 2010-11, Diptiben Rohitbhai Patel is one of the promoter director of Wood Star. Diptiben Rohitbhai Patel is also the proprietor of Timsy Traders. On a query regarding connection, vide letter dated September 19, 2015, Wood Star confirmed that Diptiben Rohitbhai Patel is the director in the company and also a proprietor of Timsy Traders.  e) Details of circular transactions of sales/purchases between the entities are depicted as follows:  f) Investigation observed that THL was making sales to Timsy Traders. This formed 69.06% of total purchases of Timsy Traders which means significant proportion of inputs for the business of Timsy were received from THL. Timsy Traders in turn making sales to Maloo Tradelink (which is connected to THL) which forms 64% of total sales of Timsy Traders and 72% of total purchases of Maloo Tradelink. This means significant proportion of inputs for the business of Maloo Tradelink were received from Timsy Traders. Maloo Tradelink in turn was making sales to Wood Star (which is connected to Timsy Traders) which formed almost 100% of total sales of Maloo Tradelink and 69.52% of total purchases of Wood Star. This means Wood Star was significantly depending on Maloo Tradelink for business inputs. Wood Star is in turnFinal Order in the matter of IPO of Timbor Home Ltd. Page 12 of 53  was making sales to THL which formed 81.24% of total sales of Wood Star and 50.17% of total purchases of THL.  g) Thus, investigation revealed that substantial portion of material that is being sold by Maloo Tradelink to Wood Star was coming from THL. Thus, THL was receiving back its own material which was again being put in the circular transactions.  Also, these circular transactions were happening through connected entities i.e. Maloo Tradelink which is connected to THL and Wood Star which is connected to Timsy Traders.  h) In order to check the genuineness of purchases/sales among the entities, information inter alia regarding mode of transport of materials along with documentary evidence regarding transportation of materials such as delivery challan/lorry receipt or any other documents were sought from THL, Wood Star, Maloo Tradelink and Timsy Traders. In reply THL and Maloo Tradelink stated that the companies are under liquidation and the official liquidator has been appointed. Therefore, they are not able to provide the information sought. Wood Star forwarded delivery challans regarding sales to THL and purchases from Maloo Tradelink. Timsy Traders forwarded delivery challans regarding sales to Maloo Tradelink and purchases from THL. On verification of these delivery challans, investigation observed that there were no transportation details such as vehicle details in which materials were transported between the entities. The delivery challan has contained only the description of product i.e. wood size (import), signature of the buyer and seller. Thus, it is revealed that the entities could not provide any evidence to show that the material was actually transported from one entity to the other entity.     3.13. Payments among the entities occurred on the same day: In 7 instances, the payments were transferred among the entities on the same day. For example, on May 17, 2011 an amount of Rs.58,64,320 was transferred from THL to Wood Star and on the same day Rs.58,60,000 was transferred from Wood Star to Maloo TradelinkFinal Order in the matter of IPO of Timbor Home Ltd. Page 13 of 53  and Rs.56,10,000 was transferred from Maloo Tradelink to Timsy Traders and Rs.56,09,500 transferred from Timsy Traders to THL. These series of fund transfers between the connected entities on the same day alleged to be not a coincidence. The investigation revealed that these fund transfers were fictitious and false book entries.  In view of the above and considering the connection between entities THL & Maloo Tradelink and Wood Star & Timsy Traders, thus, it is concluded that the sales/purchases among THL, Timsy Traders, Maloo Tradelink and Wood Star are book entries and therefore fictitious. This has resulted in inflation of both purchases and sales figures of THL for the years 2010-11 and 2011-12. In its prospectus, THL had disclosed the financial information for the year 2010 which included these inflated purchases and sales. Hence, THL and its directors made mis-leading statements in its prospectus regarding its financial information.   3.14. Disclosure related violation regarding un-utilized IPO proceeds of Rs.5 crore: a) From the verification of bank statements of the Company, (HDFC Account No. 03062560001480) investigation observed that after receipt of IPO funds, the Company transferred Rs.5 crore to Shree Corporation on June 23, 2011. The Company, vide its letters dated March 26, 2014 and April 29, 2014  replied that the Company deposited Rs.5 crore out of unutilised IPO proceeds for two years and it fetches interest at 16% per annum. Further, vide its letter dated June 26, 2014 Company replied that till 31.03.2014, it received Rs.2.10 crore as interest and forwarded the bank statements showing receipt of interest. On a query, the Company vide e-mail dated December 12, 2014 replied that the deposit with Shree Corporation still continues.  b) In page number 60 of prospectus it is stated as \\\\\\\\u201cin case of excess funds remaining after deployment as per objects of the issue, the same will be utilized for General Corporate purposes\\\\\\\\u201d. In page number 67 of the prospectus it is stated as \\\\\\\\u201cThe management, in accordance with the approval of the Board of Directors, will have the flexibility in deploying the Issue Proceeds received by us. Pending utilization for the purposesFinal Order in the matter of IPO of Timbor Home Ltd. Page 14 of 53  described above, we intend to invest the funds in high quality interest/dividend bearing liquid instruments including money market mutual funds and deposits with banks for the necessary duration or for reducing overdraft\\\\\\\\u201d. c) From the above it can be noted that the Company can use excess funds either for General Corporate Purposes or for investing in high quality interest/dividend bearing liquid instruments. The Company disclosed to the exchanges under clause 43 of listing agreement regarding utilization of IPO proceeds till quarter ended December 2013. The extract of disclosure for the quarter ended December 2013 is as follows:     d) It can be seen from the above that the Company stated that un-utilised fund towards object of the issue deployed as deposit with nationalized bank, NBFC, Mutual Fund and other Inter Corporate Deposits as an interim measure pending deployment towards the object of the issue to earn interest income. However, the Company actually deployed entire un-utilised fund with Shree Corporation.  3.15. Thus, the investigation revealed that THL has made Non-disclosure of significant liabilities in the prospectus and non-disclosure of loan of Rs.7 crore and its repayment out of IPO proceeds. It also made mis-statements regarding financial information of the Company in its prospectus. Further, it made false & mis-leading reporting of sales and purchases for the FY 2010-11 and 2011-12. THL has also made wrong disclosure to  the exchange regarding un-utilised IPO proceeds.Final Order in the matter of IPO of Timbor Home Ltd. Page 15 of 53   4. In the light of the above, THL (Noticee No.1) was advised to show cause as to why suitable directions in terms of Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11A and 11B of SEBI Act, 1992 for debarring it from accessing capital market and prohibiting the Company from issuing prospectus, any offer document, or advertisement soliciting money from the public for the issue of securities should not be issued against it for the violations as aforementioned in para 2 above. Noticee nos. 2 to 7, directors of THL were advised to show cause as to why suitable direction in terms of   11(1), 11(4) and 11B of SEBI Act, 1992 for debarring them from accessing capital market and debarring from acting as Directors in any company should not be issued against them for violation of Regulations 57 (1) and 57 (2) (a) read with Clause 2 (VII) (G) of part A of schedule VIII of the ICDR Regulations, (since repealed) (, Section 12A (a),(b),(c) of SEBI Act,1992 and Regulations 3 (b),(c),(d), 4 (1) and 4(2)(f) of the PFUPT Regulations and Clause 43 of listing agreement (now repealed) read with Section 21 of the SCRA.  5. The SCN was delivered to all Noticees except Noticee no.4. A common reply dated May 11, 2017 was received from Noticee nos. 1 and 2 stating the following:  5.1. THL, of which Noticee no. 2 was a director, filed the Red Herring Prospectus (\\\\\\\\u2018RHP\\\\\\\\u2019) dated May 20, 2011. 5.2. As regards the observation in the SCN that approximately Rs.7 crore liabilities were created against IPO proceeds is incorrect. The liabilities to the vendors are created in the ordinary course of business.  As per Annexure -I to the Auditors report and financial information of THL as on 31.12.2010, secured loans, unsecured loans, current liabilities and provisions were properly disclosed.  Annexure - VII to the Auditors report reveals the total unsecured loan received party-wise.  Similarly, secured loans party-wise are appearing in Annexure - XIII to the Auditors report.  Current liabilities as on 31.12.2010 are shown as 2160.09 lakhs. Thus, the liability is duly disclosed under the head current liabilities and provisions.  Therefore, the allegation in para 3 (d) is not correct.Final Order in the matter of IPO of Timbor Home Ltd. Page 16 of 53  5.3. It appears that there is a misunderstanding in considering the utilization as liability. The utilization by the Company as mentioned in para 3 (b) of SCN will amount to advances and thus an asset and not a liability.  Annexure - VIII to the Auditors report reveals the details of Sundry Debtors and Annexure - IX shows the loans and advances. As on 31st December 2010, the Sundry Debtors are 3719.58 lakhs and the loans and advances are 981.86 lakhs. Thus, the amount spent should be considered as an asset rather liability and which is adequately disclosed either in the form of sundry debtors or loans and advances and therefore on both this counts the allegation in para 3 (d) is not sustainable.   5.4. As regards allegation of non-disclosure of loan taken from Mr. Alin Ajaykumar Shah (Alin), the allegation is denied. First of all it should be noted that the RHP is dated May 20, 2011. The loan taken from Alin on  May 20, 2011 and subsequent dates cannot be forming part of RHP dated May 20, 2011. The loan taken from Alin is in the course of regular business activities. The loan was to tide over the temporary financial requirement which was obtained on the personal guarantee of the Director Mr. Anant Maloo. It was not a bridge loan against the IPO funds but purely temporary loan for business exigencies. Even no interest was payable. Regulation 57 (1) of ICDR Regulation requires the offer document to contain all material disclosure which are true and adequate so as to enable the applicants to take a informed investment decision.  Availing temporary loan without any interest liability does not affect the financial results or its\\\\\\\\u2019 profitability. The transactions carried out in the regular course of business are not required to be separately disclosed unless the same affects the financial results or profitability. Since the loan from Alin was utilized for the purpose of business which was received in Bank account with UBI which is duly disclosed and the amount repaid from the Bank account with HDFC Bank is also duly disclosed in the RHP, it cannot be said that the amount received from Alin, was a bridge loan against the proceeds of the issue.  The amount received by way of temporary loan and repayment thereof as promisedFinal Order in the matter of IPO of Timbor Home Ltd. Page 17 of 53  in the ordinary course of business does not amount to misstatement in the prospectus. 5.5. As regards allegation that payment to Wood Star was out of IPO proceeds is incorrect.  The amount paid to Wood Star prior to May 24, 2011 as mentioned in table in para 5 (1) can never be out of IPO proceeds because the issue closed on 2nd June, 2011 and the IPO proceeds were transferred from Escrow Account to regular Bank accounts only after 22nd June, 2011 as per instruction of lead Manager dated 22nd June 2011 itself.  The copy of letter from Corporate Strategic Allanze Limited who were the lead manager to transfer fund from IPO Escrow Account to Company Bank Account is attached herewith.  The payment to Wood Star after June 27, 2011 is 140.99 lakhs only and not 374 lakhs as alleged.  5.6. As regards the allegation in SCN that the payment to Wood Star is returned to THL is also an inference and not  fact.  The transaction with Wood Star, Maloo Trade Link, and Timsy Traders are regular business transaction for purchase and sale of goods regularly dealt in is carried out in the regular course of business. The statement of related parties transactions is appearing in Annexure - X to the Auditors report dated 21.3.2011 forming part of the RHP.  Maloo Trade Link is a party declared as a related party in the said Annexure.  However, Wood Star and Timsy Traders are not related parties.  Wood Star and Timsy Traders may be related to each other but it is not a related party so far as THL is concerned and this fact is emanating from the SCN also.   5.7. As regards the observation in SCN that THL could not provide evidence to show that the material was actually transported, it is submitted that due to a massive fire at the premises of THL on 17th August 2013, the records were completely gutted in fire. Because of such fire, the Company incurred huge loss", "Date": "2020-12-15", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "In the matter of Initial Public Offering of Timbor Home Ltd.", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/dec-2020/in-the-matter-of-initial-public-offering-of-timbor-home-ltd-_48441.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 57874, "unique_record_id": "3afa0026a7SEBI20201215", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6680889578589103064715a2", "parse_date": "2024-06-29 22:19:32", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Disclosure Failings", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "The article does not mention any financial penalties.", "gpt_audience": "- Investors\n- Shareholders\n- Regulatory authorities (e.g., SEBI)\n- Financial analysts\n- Legal professionals\n- Company management and directors\n- Auditors\n- Financial journalists\n- Potential investors in future IPOs\n- Market researchers", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

In a decision dated 27 November 2020, the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 90 found guilty beyond reasonable doubt Rolando R. Pascua, Jr., Celia Pascua, and Mary Jane P. Recto for violations of Section 8 of Republic Act No. 8799, otherwise known as the Securities Regulation Code (SRC).  \\\\\\\\u201cWinning cases against perpetrators of fraudulent investment schemes affirm the Commission\\\\\\\\u2019s commitment to holding them accountable for their actions against our fellow Filipinos,\\\\\\\\u201d SEC Chairperson Emilio B. Aquino said.  \\\\\\\\u201cThe SEC will remain steadfast in its mission to protect investors and educate the public about these types of scams, so that moving forward, no more Filipinos would be duped of their hard-earned money.\\\\\\\\u201d The case stemmed from affidavits filed on 14 September 2009 by 22 complainants-investors with the SEC\\\\\\\\u2019s then Enforcement and Prosecution Department, now the Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD).  The complainants-investors accused officers of RJF Construction and Development Corp., which claimed to be a land developer accredited with the Home Development Mutual Fund (PAG-IBIG), of enticing them to make an investment in exchange for a guaranteed interest rate of 5% per month, or 60% per year.  The investors were allegedly given post-dated checks as proof of their investments, as well as other documents such as original copies of land titles that serve as security for the loans.  RJF issued a total of 16 promissory notes, supported by multiple post-dated checks, to the 22 complainants-investors. The company claimed that the money raised will be used to finance its PAG-IBIG housing project worth about P2.5 billion, or 1,016 housing units for about P200,000 each.  While the company was initially able to give the promised returns to investors, RJF eventually failed to pay them the guaranteed interest and principal, prompting investors to seek relief from the Commission. Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary S-309, 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141; 818-5478  In a conference arranged by the SEC on 14 October 2009, nine complainant-investors named Recto as the RJF officer who enticed them to invest in the company.  The court ruled that the post-dated checks issued by RJF assumed the character of \\\\\\\\u201cevidences of indebtedness,\\\\\\\\u201d which are among the securities mentioned under Section 3 of the SRC.  Section 3 of the SRC defines securities as \\\\\\\\u201cshares, participation or interests in a corporation or in a commercial enterprise or profit-making venture and evidenced by a certificate, contract, instrument, whether writer or electronic in character.  Meanwhile, Section 8 of the SRC provides that securities shall not be sold or offered for sale or distribution in the Philippines without a registration statement duly filed with and approved by the Commission.  \\\\\\\\u201cIn the instant case, the checks were issued by RJF in lieu of the securities enumerated under the (SRC) in an attempt, to take the case out of the purview of the law, which requires prior license to sell or deal in securities and registration thereof. The arrangement was designed to circumvent the law,\\\\\\\\u201d according to the decision.  The court also noted that the RJF is not a registered issuer of securities based on SEC records, and is therefore not licensed to offer or issue securities to the public.  \\\\\\\\u201cIt is one thing for a corporation to issue checks to satisfy isolated individual obligations, and another for a corporation to execute an elaborate scheme where it would comport itself to the public as a pseudo-investment house and issue postdated checks instead of stocks or securities to evidence the investments of its clients,\\\\\\\\u201d the decision read.  \\\\\\\\u201cAccused adopted this system in an attempt to circumvent the Revised Securities Act, which requires a prior license to sell or deal in securities.\\\\\\\\u201d Pursuant to the SEC\\\\\\\\u2019s continuing fight against investment scams, the Commission in 2020 issued advisories against more than 100 groups and individuals for soliciting investments without the necessary license, almost double the total number in 2019.  The SEC likewise issued cease and desist orders and revocation orders against entities engaging in fraudulent investments schemes, including Boss Network, Forsage, and Fast Track Worldwide Inc.   Previously, the Commission has charged 32 individuals in seven cases for violations of the SRC, and in two cases for violations of Republic Act No. 10175, or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.", "Date": "2020-12-14", "Regulatory": "SEC PH", "Title": "SEC SCORES LEGAL VICTORY AGAINST PERPETRATORS OF INVESTMENT SCAM", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov.ph/pr-2020/sec-scores-legal-victory-against-perpetrators-of-investment-scam/", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "Philippines", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 57839, "unique_record_id": "51df84574dSECPH20201214", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "668085e87858910306471574", "parse_date": "2024-06-29 22:08:13", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Unregistered", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "P2,000,000", "gpt_audience": "- Investors\n- Legal professionals\n- Regulatory authorities\n- Financial advisors\n- Media outlets\n- Consumer protection agencies\n- Government officials\n- Business community\n- General public", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "Rolando R.

It is further observed from the ICICI Bank Customer Relationship Form that Equity Mania Financial Advisory is a sole proprietorship of Mr. Ankit Goel. Further, it is noted that under the heading \\\\\\\\u201cType of Industry\\\\\\\\u201d, it is mentioned as \\\\\\\\u201cEquity Financial Service\\\\\\\\u201d.  5.6. From the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s website, it is observed that, payments can be made to the firm in its bank account maintained with ICICI Bank (A/c No. 317805500006). The transactions observed in the abovementioned bank account are summarized as under: Account Number & Bank Period for which bank statement is obtained Total amount Credited (Rs.) No. of Credit Transac tions Last Credit Trans action date Closing Balance A/c No: 317805500006 ICICI Bank December 16, 2016 to August 14, 2020 35,22,443 128 March 20, 2020 1,57,321  Payumoney  December 16, 2016 to August 31, 2020 11,01,670 130 August 23, 2019 NA  Instamojo  December 24, 2017 to October 30, 2020  2,28,827 44 January 22, 2020 NA Total 48,52,941 302    5.7. From the analysis of Bank statement, the following is observed: 5.7.1. The bank account is active. 5.7.2. The total credit received in the aforesaid account is approximately Rs. 48.52 lakh during the period December 16, 2016 to August 14, 2020.  5.7.3. It is observed that there are 302 credit transactions received in the said bank account. From the narrative of the transactions, it appears that the payments have, prima facie, come from various investors / clients. An illustrative list of narrations in the bank account of the firm is as under: Transaction Date Narration Credit (Rs.) 17/9/2019 BIL/INFT/001801869143/Subscription/ 35000 11/10/2019 BIL/INFT/001820615118/2YRFNOSUBSC7OCT/ 45800 22/10/2019 BIL/INFT/001828436003/2YROPTIONSUB/ 55000 25/10/2019 BIL/INFT/001831368251/Midterm Subscre/ 37500__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Equity Mania Financial Advisory                                                        Page 6 of 15  5.8. It is further observed from the submission of the firm (received by SEBI on August 25, 2020) that it has collected Rs. 42,96,283/- from 257 clients offering its services as mentioned on its website. 6. In light of the aforesaid discussions, I prima facie observe based on the contents of firm\\\\\\\\u2019s website wherein various services offered by the firm has been described, that Equity Mania Financial Advisory is prima facie, holding itself out as an investment adviser. Further, it is also prima facie, observed from the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s webpages that it offers various tips / services to its clients in the securities market through phone calls and SMS. Considering the above facts and circumstances, especially the content of the website of the firm coupled with the credit transactions in the bank account, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees / funds credited to the bank account, were for the purpose of availing the services indicated on the website of Equity Mania Financial Advisory.  7. In this factual context, I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d  8. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is observed from the contents of the website of the firm that the firm is prima facie, holding itself out as investment adviser by offering to provide investment advice as defined under regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations by offering to give advice related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription. Further, as noted from the bank account that there are multiple credit entries which when seen together with the contents of the website leads to the prima facie conclusion that the credit entries in the bank account are consideration for the investment advice given by the firm to its clients.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Equity Mania Financial Advisory                                                        Page 7 of 15  Thus, prima facie, the firm is an investment adviser as defined under regulation 2 (m) of IA Regulations.  9. Further, the fact that the firm has admitted of collecting money from its clients for the various investment advisory services offered by the firm as mentioned on its website, is an acknowledgment / admission by the firm that it has not only held itself out as investment adviser but has also acted as an investment adviser for consideration. 10. With respect to the prima facie amount collected by the firm, I note that the website of the firm went live in the month of December, 2016. From the web archive (http://web.archive.org/web/20170708065718/http://equitymania.com/payment.html) the earliest available webpage reflecting the payment details (ICICI Bank Ltd. account details and Payumoney) is on July 8, 2017. The website as on November 19, 2020 also had the same payment details. Thus, it is prima facie observed that the payment details (ICICI Bank Ltd. account details and Payumoney) are there since the inception of the firm / website. Moreover, it is noted that bank account displayed on the website of the firm is in the name of the firm and was opened in the month of December, 2016, the same time when the website went live. Even the first transaction in the Payumoney account is in the month of December, 2016 and the said Payumoney account is linked to the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s ICICI Bank account. From the material available on record, it is noted that the payment gateway, Instamojo account was opened in the month of March, 2017 and is also linked to the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s ICICI Bank account. Thus, considering the ICICI Bank account is in the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s name and is there since the inception of the firm, coupled with the discussion in preceding paragraph that the firm prima facie renders unregistered investment advisory activities, at this stage, it can be prima facie held that all the credits in the bank account of the firm is for / related to, service rendered by the firm. Further, the firm has not submitted any evidence of other sources of credits. Therefore, for the purpose of money collected by the firm from its investor, all the credit transactions are taken into account, which is Rs. 48,52,941/-. Hence, the submission of the firm that it has collected Rs. 42,96,283/- is not acceptable at this stage.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Equity Mania Financial Advisory                                                        Page 8 of 15  Issue No. 2: If answer to aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether Equity Mania Financial Advisory has, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act read with IA Regulations? 11. In order to ensure that investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of SEBI Act reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d Further, as per regulation 3(1) of IA Regulations, the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.  12. The activities of the firm, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that Equity Mania Financial Advisory was holding itself out as an investment adviser and also has been acting as an investment adviser. However, no material is available on record to indicate that Equity Mania Financial Advisory or its proprietor, Mr. Ankit Goel in his individual capacity has a certificate of registration as investment adviser. In this context, it is noted that Equity Mania Financial Advisory or its proprietor, Mr. Ankit Goel in his individual capacity, is not registered with SEBI in any capacity. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by Equity Mania Financial Advisory, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, leads to the conclusion that Equity Mania Financial Advisory is holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser without a certificate of registration from SEBI. In my view, these activities/ representations of Equity Mania Financial Advisory__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Equity Mania Financial Advisory                                                        Page 9 of 15  are, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations. Issue No. 3: If answers to issue nos. (4.1) & (4.2) are affirmative, who are responsible for the violations? 13. I note that Mr. Ankit Goel is the sole proprietor of Equity Mania Financial Advisory. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in Ashok Transport Agency vs. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business.  A suit by or against a proprietary concern is by or against the proprietor of the business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Mr. Ankit Goel is liable for the acts and omissions of Equity Mania Financial Advisory. Issue No. 4: If answer to issue no. 4.2 is in affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any should be issued against those responsible for the prima facie, violations?  14. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. IA Regulations has been formulated with the main objective of regulating investment advisory activities to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of investment advisory activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations, inter alia, seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the criteria set out in the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market.  15. In the instant case, Equity Mania Financial Advisory is soliciting and inducing investors to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips, intra-day calls etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration / certification as mandated under the IA Regulations. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Equity Mania Financial Advisory through its proprietor, from collecting any more fees from the public and__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Equity Mania Financial Advisory                                                        Page 10 of 15  indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. It is noted from material available on record that bank account of Equity Mania Financial Advisory is active. Moreover, the website of the firm was active in the month of November, 2020. Furthermore, the details of the firm including its email and telephone number were mentioned on its website. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Equity Mania Financial Advisory in the securities market is still in existence and imminent. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Equity Mania Financial Advisory is Rs. 48,52,941/- and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.  16. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from the unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from unregistered investment advisor vis-\\\\\\\\xe0-vis an investor who receives such service from a SEBI registered investment adviser stands at a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged under the IA Regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment adviser.  Availing of service from such persons is detrimental to investors and such unqualified service results in irreparable detriment as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victim of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury/detriment to the development of the securities market also qualifies as an \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d. The objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market. 17. Further if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may have to part away with large fees and investment resulting into irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is right of the current entity herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the ex-parte orders in the case of private suits and ex-parte public enforcement actions, is the identification of__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Equity Mania Financial Advisory                                                        Page 11 of 15  the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential deployment of funds by the investors by following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if, prima facie, unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing an ex-parte interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favour of the entity.   18. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Equity Mania Financial Advisory from collecting any more funds from the public and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. As noted in the preceding paragraphs, the bank account of the firm is still active. Moreover, the website of the firm was active as on November, 2020. The same prima facie demonstrates that Equity Mania Financial Advisory can still lure investors to deal through it in the securities market and probability of investors reaching Equity Mania Financial Advisory is still high. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Equity Mania Financial Advisory in the securities market is still in existence and imminent.  19. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Equity Mania Financial Advisory is approximately Rs. 48.52 lakh and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors. In light of the same, I find that there is no other alternative but to take recourse through an interim ex-parte order against Equity Mania Financial Advisory and its proprietor for preventing them from collecting funds by indulging in unauthorized investment advisory services without obtaining the mandatory registrations from SEBI in accordance with the law. As the website of the firm is active which prima facie, shows that the investors can reach it and also its bank account is active, the balance of convenience demands the preventive measure of stopping the collection of money in the bank account of the firm from investors. The__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Equity Mania Financial Advisory                                                        Page 12 of 15  same can be effectively achieved by an appropriate direction of stopping credit into the bank account of the firm. As Equity Mania Financial Advisory and its proprietor have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, the balance of convenience also demands that Equity Mania Financial Advisory and its proprietor have to be prevented from diverting the funds collected from the investors through unauthorized investment advisory activity. Accordingly, an appropriate direction stopping the debit from the bank account of the firm and its proprietor have been incorporated.  20. With the initiation of quasi-judicial proceedings and the given the fact that Equity Mania Financial Advisory and its proprietor has already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI, it is imminent that the firm and its proprietor may divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients. The same may result in defeating the effective implementation of the direction of refund, if any, to be passed after deciding the matter on merits. It therefore becomes necessary for SEBI to take urgent steps to prevent the firm and its proprietor from diverting the money collected from the subscribers / clients. It is also essential to take urgent steps to prevent them from alienating any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets, so that the final remedies, if any, do not become infructuous. In view of the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove, and considering the interests of already existing clients of the firm and its proprietor and also the interests of those who may fall prey to the unregistered investment advisory by reaching the firm through email or telephone, the balance of convenience lies against the firm and its proprietor, which requires immediate action against them including not to divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients / investors.

In light of the aforesaid discussions, I prima facie observe from the contents of Money Streets\\\\\\\\u2019 website wherein various services offered by Money Streets have been described, that it is prima facie holding itself out as an investment adviser. As per the website of Money Streets which is active as on date, and from the investor complaint, it is noted that Money Streets offered various tips / services to its clients in the securities market through telephone calls, SMSs. Further, Considering the above facts and circumstances, especially the content of the website of Money Streets coupled with the credit transactions in the bank accounts and through the payment gateway, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees / funds credited to the bank accounts and by payment gateway, were for the purpose of availing the services indicated on the website of Money Streets.   8.1 In this factual context, I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d   8.2 In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is observed from the contents of the website of the Money Streets that it is holding itself out as an investment adviser by prima facie offering__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Money Streets Advisory Services LLP Page 7 of 16 to provide investment advice as defined under regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations by offering to give advice related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription. Further, as noted from the bank accounts there are multiple credit entries which when seen together with the contents of the websites lead to a prima facie conclusion that the credit entries in the bank accounts are consideration for the investment advice given by Money Streets to its clients. Thus, prima facie the Money Streets is an investment adviser as defined under regulation 2 (m) of IA Regulations.  8.3 Therefore, the activity of Money Streets by virtue of its website contents amounts to holding itself to be giving trading tips, stock specific recommendations, etc., to the investors and general public. The fact of the receipt of money in the bank statements, prima facie, shows, on preponderance of probability basis, that the credit for payment of fees is in fact meant for the advisory services actually rendered by Money Streets. Therefore, Money Streets has not only held itself out as an investment adviser but also is acting as an investment adviser for consideration.  Issue No.2: If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether Money Streets has, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act) read with IA Regulations?  9. In order to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out  investment  advisory  activities  has  to  necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Money Streets Advisory Services LLP Page 8 of 16 buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  Further, as per Regulation 3(1) of  the  SEBI  (Investment  Advisers)  Regulations,  2013 (hereinafter referred to as the IA Regulations), the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.  10. The activities of Money Streets, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that Money Streets is holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser. However, no material is available on record to indicate that Money Streets or its Partners are holding a certificate of registration as investment adviser. In this context, it is noted that  Money Streets or its partners in their individual capacity  are not  registered  with  SEBI  in  the any capacity. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by Money Streets, as  discussed  in  the  preceding  issue,  prima  facie,  leads  to  the  conclusion  that Money Streets is holding itself  out  and  acting  as  an  investment  adviser  without  a  certificate  of registration.  11. In my view, these activities/ representations without holding the certificate of registration as investment adviser is prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.  Issue No. 3: If answers to Issue Nos. (1) & (2) are affirmative, who are responsible for the violations? 12. I note from the LLP Agreement dated September 4, 2017 entered into by Money Streets that Mr.Zulfiqar Ahmed and Mr.Ifteqaar are the designated partners of Money Streets. As per the LLP Agreement, the contribution of Money Streets shall be Rs.6,00,000 which shall be contributed by the partners equally i.e. Rs. 3,00,000 each. Further, the partners are__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Money Streets Advisory Services LLP Page 9 of 16 entitled to share the profit and losses in the ratio of their respective contribution in Money Streets. As per the LLP Agreement \\\\\\\\u201cthe business of the Money Streets Advisory Services LLP shall be: to establish, setup and run in any part of India Investment Advisory Services including Futures & Options in India/outside India or any business in any other manner as may be decided by the majority of Partners\\\\\\\\u201d. Mr.Zulfiqar Ahmed and Mr.Ifteqaar are the partners of Money Streets having equal rights and obligations. This clause coupled with their contribution and the 50:50 profit sharing ratio clearly shows that the designated partners Mr.Zulfiqar Ahmed and Mr.Ifteqaar are controlling the LLP for the purpose of managing the Investment Advisory Services. Therefore, I find that they are in charge and responsible for the affairs of the LLP. 13. It is already established in the preceding paragraphs that Money Streets is carrying out IA activities without obtaining certificate of registration from SEBI. I note that being the signatory to the LLP Agreement of Money Streets which mentions Investment Advisory Services as the only business of Money Streets, the partners viz., Mr.Zulfiqar Ahmed and Mr.Ifteqaar  had knowledge and awareness of providing IA services by the company to its clients without obtaining certificate of registration from SEBI. The requirement of seeking registration when the Investment Advisory Services are provided by Money Streets as an LLP rests with its designated partners. Therefore, I find that Mr.Zulfiqar Ahmed and Mr.Ifteqaar are liable for the contravention of law committed by Money Streets and for the consequences of the contravention. Refund being one of the consequences of the contravention, they are prima facie liable jointly and severally with Money Streets for refund of the fees collected from the clients for unregistered investment advisory activity.  Issue No. 4: If answer to Issue No.  (2) is affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any should be issued against those responsible for the violations?  14. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market.  Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of regulating Investment__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Money Streets Advisory Services LLP Page 10 of 16 Advisory Services to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of such activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations, inter alia, seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the criteria set out in the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market.  15. In the instant case, Money Streets is soliciting and inducing the investors to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration/certification as mandated under the IA Regulations. Further, it is noted from material available on record of that, the website is active as on date and money has been credited to the Bank accounts of Money Streets during the period of examination. Thus, the account is active and can continue to be used to collect fees from unsuspecting investors.    16. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to  take immediate  steps  to  prevent  Money Streets and its partners from  collecting any more  fees from  the  public  and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. I note that the website is active as on date and the investors can also reach Money Streets through telephone, SMSes, etc. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Money Streets in the securities market is still in existence and imminent. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Money Streets is Rs. 92.53 Lacs and the same indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.   17. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from the unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from registered investment advisor in consonance with the IA Regulations visa-__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Money Streets Advisory Services LLP Page 11 of 16 vis an investor who receives such service from unregistered investment adviser stands at a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged under the IA regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment adviser. Availing of service from such persons is detrimental to investors and such unqualified service results in irreparable detriment as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victim of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury/detriment to the development of the securities market also qualifies as an \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d. The objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market.   18. Further if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may have to part away with large fees and investments resulting into irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is right of the current entity herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the ex-parte orders in the case of private suits and ex-parte public enforcement actions, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential loss of investment by the investors by following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if, prima facie, unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not  passing an ex-parte interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favour of the entity.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Money Streets Advisory Services LLP Page 12 of 16 19. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Money Streets and its partners from collecting any more fees from the public and from indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. As noted in the preceding paragraphs, at least till the examination period, monies were being received in the bank account of Money Streets and bank account is still active. Moreover, the website of Money Streets is still active. The aforesaid prima facie demonstrates that Money Streets can still lure investors to deal in the securities market while acting on its advice and probability of investors reaching it is still high. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Money Streets in the securities market is still in existence and imminent.  20. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Money Streets is Rs. 92.53 Lacs and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors. In light of the same, I find that there is no other alternative but to take recourse through an interim ex-parte order against Money Streets and its partners for preventing them from collecting funds by indulging in unauthorized investment advisory services without obtaining the mandatory registrations from SEBI in accordance with the law. As the website and bank accounts of Money Streets is active and the investors can reach them through telephone also the balance of convenience demands the preventive measure of stopping the collection of money in the bank account of the Money Streets from investors. The same can be effectively achieved by an appropriate direction of stopping the credit into the bank account of Money Streets. As Money Streets has already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, the balance of convenience also demands that Money Streets needs to be prevented from diverting the funds collected from the investors through the unauthorized investment advisory activity. Accordingly, an appropriate direction stopping the debit from the bank account of Money Streets has been incorporated. 21. With the initiation of quasi-judicial proceedings, and given the fact that Money Streets and its partners have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Money Streets Advisory Services LLP Page 13 of 16 unregistered investment adviser, it is imminent that they may divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients. The same may result in defeating the effective implementation of the direction of refund, if any, to be passed after deciding the matter on merits. It therefore becomes necessary for SEBI to take urgent steps to prevent Noticee from diverting the money collected from the subscribers / clients. It is also essential to take urgent steps to prevent them from alienating any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets, so that the final remedies, if any, do not become infructuous. In view of the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove, and considering the interests of already existing clients of these Noticees and also the interests of those who may fall prey to the unregistered investment advisory by reaching it through the website or telephone the balance of convenience lies against the Noticee, and requires immediate action against it including not to divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients / investors.  Order 22. In view of the above, pending detailed examination, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me by virtue of Section 19 read with Sections 11, 11(4), 11B(1) and 11D read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992, hereby issue by way of this interim ex-parte order, the following directions:   22.1  Money Streets and its Partners viz., Mr.Zulfiqar Ahmed and Mr.Ifteqaar are directed to: i.

Not to divert any funds raised from investors, kept in bank account(s) and/or in their custody until further orders.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Money Streets Advisory Services LLP Page 14 of 16 iii.

To submit the number and details of clients who have availed their investment advisory services and to submit details of fees collected from each such client, immediately but not later than 5 working days from the date of receipt of this order.  22.2 If Money Streets or its Partners have any open positions in any exchange traded derivative contracts, as on the date of the order, they can close out/ square off such open positions within 3 months from the date of order or at the expiry of such contracts, whichever is earlier. Money Streets and its Partners are permitted to settle the pay-in and pay-out obligations in respect of transactions, if any, which have taken place before the close of trading on the date of this order.  22.3 ICICI Bank (Account Number 029705004355) wherein Money Streets is holding bank account, is directed not to allow any debits/ withdrawals from and not to allow any credits to the said account, without the permission of SEBI. The payment gateway PayU money wherein Money Streets is holding an account shall be deactivated till further orders. The Banks and payment gateway are directed to ensure that all the above directions are strictly enforced.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Money Streets Advisory Services LLP Page 15 of 16 22.4 The Depositories are directed to ensure, till further directions, that they neither permit any debits nor any credits in the demat accounts held by: a.

The brief findings of the investigation and the allegations made, as contained in the SCN, are as follows:  a. Investigation observed that Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s had made announcement on July 10, 2017 during market hours on the exchange platform titled \\\\\\\\u201cUSFDA to Lift Import Alert 99-32 on the company's Unit-II at Visakhapatnam\\\\\\\\u201d.

Therefore, the aforesaid announcement was related to material event as it was disclosed under Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015. Thus, in terms of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015, the said announcement was considered as UPSI as per Regulation 2(1)(n)(vi) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015, whereFinal order in the matter of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s Laboratories Ltd.  Page 3 of 19  material event in accordance with the listing agreement comes under the definition of UPSI.   c. From the submission of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s vide emails dated May 31, 2019 and June 18, 2019), the chronology of events relating to the aforesaid announcement, is as under \\\\\\\\u2013  Table 1 Date and Time(IST) Particulars/Events July 7 2017 at 04:36:23 am Email received by Divis (Kiran Devi) from its Regulatory Counsel (who interacted with US FDA) that 99\\\\\\\\u201332 import alert is being lifted.

The text of the draft announcement to the exchanges is approved by about 11:40 am July 10, 2017 11:40 am After conclusion of the meeting, submission is made to the stock exchange.  d. It was observed that the aforesaid announcement was published on BSE exchange on July 10, 2017 at 11:50:35.  Therefore July 07, 2017-04:36 am to July 10, 2017-11:50 am (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cUPSI Period\\\\\\\\u201d) is considered is as UPSI Period.   e. It was observed that the list of people who had received the email as mentioned in Table 1 also included Madhusudhana Rao Divi, Whole time director of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s. Hence, Madhusudhana Rao Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s is an \\\\\\\\u2018insider\\\\\\\\u2019 as per Regulation 2(1)(g) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015.  f. It was observed from the submissions of the Company vide emails dated August 27, 2019 and July 02, 2019 that the Noticee was an Assistant General Manager and a Designated Person in Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s. The Noticee was observed to report directly to Madhusudhana Rao Divi, an insider and the Noticee also has direct and frequent communication with Madhusudhana Rao Divi during the past six months prior to the announcement dated July 10, 2017.Final order in the matter of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s Laboratories Ltd.  Page 4 of 19   g. In view of the aforesaid, it was observed that the Noticee is Connected Person as per Regulation 2(1)(d)(i) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015, who is reasonably expected to have access to the UPSI and hence, an \\\\\\\\u2018insider\\\\\\\\u2019 as per Regulation 2(1)(g)(i) and Regulation 2(1)(g)(ii) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015.   h. The graphical representation of connections is as follows:  i. It was observed from the trade details received from the exchange that the Noticee had traded in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s during UPSI Period and details of those trades are tabulated in following table:  Table No.: 2  Trading during UPSI period Date Trading member Exchange Instrument Type Buy Quantity Sell Quantity 10/07/2017 JM Financial Services Limited NSE Stock Future 4,000 0 Order & Trade time is before 11:50 am on 10/07/2017.  j. Pursuant to above buy trades during UPSI Period, the Noticee was observed to have sell trades within a few days of post announcement wherein all the buy positions are sold.

Further, it was also observed that the Noticee had traded only in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s during UPSI Period.   l. It was observed that the Noticee, being an insider to the Company, had traded in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s when in possession of the UPSI, thereby indulging in \\\\\\\\u201cinsider trading\\\\\\\\u201d, in terms of Regulation 4(1) of the Insider Trading Regulations, 2015. It is therefore alleged in the SCN that the Noticee had violated Section 12A (d) and (e) of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 4(1) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015.   m. The investigation observed that the value of trade executed during UPSI Period by the Noticee crossed Rs. 10 Lakhs (Ref. Table 4). As a Designated Person of the Company, the Noticee was required to make required disclosures as per Regulations 7(2)(a) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015. However, the said disclosure is not available on the BSE and NSE websites. It was observed from the submission of the Company that it did not receive any disclosure from the Noticee for the trades executed during July 07, 2017-July 10, 2017. Further, the Noticee vide email dated September 04, 2019 had accepted that he did not provide any disclosure to the Company under Insider Trading Regulations, 2015 for the aforementioned trades. Hence, according to the SCN, the Noticee being an employee of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s, had allegedly violated Regulation 7(2)(a) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015.  n. Further, the Noticee, being a Designated Person of the Company, should have obtained pre-clearance from the Company for his aforementioned trade where trade value exceeded Rs Ten Lakhs as per clause 6 of the Minimum Standards for Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Insiders as specified in Schedule B read with Regulation 9(1) of Insider TradingFinal order in the matter of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s Laboratories Ltd.  Page 6 of 19  Regulations, 2015.  It was observed from the submission of the Company that the Noticee did not obtain pre-clearance for his aforementioned trade. Further, the Noticee vide email dated September 04, 2019 had accepted that he did not take any pre-clearance from the Company for the aforementioned trade. Hence, according to the SCN, the Noticee had allegedly violated Clause 6 of the Minimum Standards for Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Insiders as specified in Schedule B read with Regulation 9(1) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015.   o. Further, the SCN has alleged that the Noticee had made the wrongful notional gains on account of insider trading as per following table:  Table No.4  BUY SELL   Segment  Buy Quantity(A) Buy Value (B) Actual Sell Quantity (C ) Remaining Shares Quantity unsold  (D=A-C) Actual Sell value( E) Notional Sell Value (F=D* Settlement price on July 10, 2017 ) Total Sell Value (G=F+E) Wrongful Gains made  (in Rs) (H=G-B) Stock Futures 4,000 27,67,200 0 4,000                    -    29,50,200  29,50,200 1,83,000 Settlement price in the Stock Future of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s on July 10, 2017 was Rs 737.55.  p. In view of above, the Noticee is called upon to show cause as to, (i) why suitable directions under Sections 11B(1) and 11(4) read with section 11(1) of SEBI Act, 1992, including debarment for an appropriate period and disgorgement of wrongful gain should not be issued against him; and (ii) why suitable directions for imposing penalty under sections 11B(2) and 11(4A)  read with Sections 15G, 15A(b) and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Securities  and   Exchange    Board    of    India  (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 should not be issued against him for the alleged violations of the aforementioned provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 and Insider Trading Regulations, 2015.Final order in the matter of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s Laboratories Ltd.  Page 7 of 19  Reply, Personal Hearing and Submissions:  4. The Noticee has filed his reply dated July 29, 2020 and he had also availed the opportunity of personal hearing on October 27, 2020. The key contentions raised by the Noticee to the allegations in the SCN, are as follows:  a. I hereby confirm that there was no internal communication or information regarding UPSI to me through any means. I also confirm that I have not received any sort of information on the UPSI from Mr. Madhusudhan Rao Divi, Whole Time Director. b. The trades were executed by me without knowing about the UPSI. Thus trade is purely co-incidental one and not because of knowing the UPSI.  c. I submit that pre-clearance was not taken and disclosure was not submitted to the Company. This will never be repeated in future and will fully abide by the Code of Conduct.  Consideration of Issues and findings thereon:  5. I have perused the allegations made in the SCN, contentions raised by the Noticee in the reply and submissions made during the personal hearings by the Noticee. I shall now proceed to examine the case on merits.  Re: Whether there was UPSI?  6. UPSI is defined in Regulation 2(1)(n) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015 as follows:   Definitions.  2.(1) In  these  regulations,  unless  the  context  otherwise  requires,  the  following  words, expressions and derivations therefrom shall have the meanings assigned to them as under:\\\\\\\\u2013  (n) \"unpublished price sensitive information\"  means  any  information, relating  to  a  company or its securities, directly or indirectly, that is not generally available which upon becoming generally available, is likely to materially affect the price of the securities and shall, ordinarily including but not restricted to, information relating to the following:  (i)    financial results;Final order in the matter of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s Laboratories Ltd.  Page 8 of 19   (ii)  dividends;        (iii) change in capital structure;     (iv) mergers, de-mergers, acquisitions, delistings, disposals and expansion of business and such other transactions;   (v) changes in key managerial personnel; and  (vi)  material events in accordance with the listing agreement.    NOTE:  It is intended that information relating to a company or securities, that is not generally available would be  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  if  it  is  likely  to  materially  affect  the  price  upon  coming  into the public domain. The types of matters that would ordinarily give rise to unpublished price sensitive information have been listed above to give illustrative guidance of unpublished price sensitive information.   7. I note that the information relating to \\\\\\\\u201cUSFDA to Lift Import Alert 99-32 on the company's Unit-II at Visakhapatnam\\\\\\\\u201d was disclosed by Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s to the stock exchange on July 10, 2017, as part of its obligation under Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015. Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 states \\\\\\\\u201cEvery listed entity shall make disclosures of any events or information which, in the opinion of the board of directors of the listed company, is material\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that the aforesaid announcement was related to material event as it was disclosed under Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 and thus, in terms of Regulation 2(1)(n)(vi) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015, where material event in accordance with the listing agreement (now substantially replaced by SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015), comes under the definition of UPSI, the aforesaid information before becoming generally available was UPSI. I note that the Noticee has not disputed the findings of investigation contained the SCN with regard to identification of UPSI as the information relating to \\\\\\\\u201cUSFDA to Lift Import Alert 99-32 on the company's Unit-II at Visakhapatnam\\\\\\\\u201d. Additionally, I also note that this information about the Company was also of the nature that after becoming generally available, it was likely to materially affect the price of the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s, hence, also in terms Regulation 2(1)(n) of the Insider Trading Regulations, 2015, the aforesaid information was \\\\\\\\u2018unpublished price sensitive information\\\\\\\\u2019, I find that the said information was UPSI before it was disclosed by Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s to stock exchanges on July 10, 2017 at 11:50 am, in terms of regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015.   Re: Whether Noticee is an Insider:Final order in the matter of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s Laboratories Ltd.  Page 9 of 19  8. The SCN alleges that the Noticee was an \\\\\\\\u2018insider\\\\\\\\u2019 in terms of Regulation 2(1)(g)(i) and Regulation 2(1)(g)(ii) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015. The SCN also alleges that the Noticee was a \\\\\\\\u2018Connected Person\\\\\\\\u2019 in terms of Regulation 2(1)(d)(i) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015. It is pertinent to peruse the definition of \\\\\\\\u2018insider\\\\\\\\u2019 and \\\\\\\\u2018Connected Person\\\\\\\\u2019 as per the Insider Trading Regulations, 2015.   \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026Definitions.  2.(1) In  these  regulations,  unless  the  context  otherwise  requires,  the  following  words, expressions and derivations therefrom shall have the meanings assigned to them as under:\\\\\\\\u2013   \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..

From the above provisions, I note that the Insider Trading Regulations, 2015, defines \\\\\\\\u2018insider\\\\\\\\u2019 as meaning any person who is either a \\\\\\\\u2018Connected Person\\\\\\\\u2019 {Regulation 2(1)(g)(i)}; or any person in possession of or having access to UPSI {Regulation 2(1)(g)(ii)}. I note that the SCN alleges that the Noticee was an \\\\\\\\u2018insider\\\\\\\\u2019 in terms of Regulation 2(g)(i) as well as Regulation 2(g)(ii).   10. I also note that the Noticee was in employment with Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s since 1995.  I note that the Noticee was working at the position of Assistant General Manager in the Environment, Health and Safety Department at Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s, during the UPSI Period. These facts show that the Noticee was directly associated with the Company and thus a \\\\\\\\u2018Connected Person\\\\\\\\u2019 in terms of Regulation 2(1)(d)(i) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015. Further, I note that the Noticee has neither disputed his employment relationship with the Company, nor his identification as \\\\\\\\u2018ConnectedFinal order in the matter of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s Laboratories Ltd.  Page 10 of 19  Person\\\\\\\\u2019 in the SCN. In view of this, I find that being the \\\\\\\\u2018Connected Person\\\\\\\\u2019, the Noticee was an \\\\\\\\u2018insider\\\\\\\\u2019 in terms of Regulation 2(1)(g)(i) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015. Since, the Noticee has been found to be an \\\\\\\\u2018insider\\\\\\\\u2019 within the meaning of Regulation 2(1)(g)(i), by virtue of being a \\\\\\\\u2018Connected Person\\\\\\\\u2019, hence, the allegation of Noticee being an \\\\\\\\u2018insider\\\\\\\\u2019 under Regulation 2(1)(g)(ii), is not being gone into, in the present proceedings.   Re: Whether Noticee has traded in violation of Regulation 4(1) of PIT Regulations, 2015:  11. The SCN has alleged that the Noticee has violated Regulation 4(1) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015 and Section 12A (d) and (e) of SEBI Act, 1992, by trading in the securities of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s on July 10, 2017, when in possession of UPSI. Regulation 4(1) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015 and Section 12A (d) and (e) of SEBI Act, 1992, reads as under:        SEBI Act, 1992:   Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control.  12A. No person shall directly or indirectly: - (d)  engage in insider trading;    (e)  deal  in  securities  while  in  possession  of  material  or  non-public  information  or communicate such material or non-public information to any other person, in a manner which is in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  Insider Trading Regulations, 2015:   4.(1) No insider shall trade in  securities  that  are  listed  or  proposed  to  be  listed  on  a  stock exchange when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information:   Provided that the insider may prove his innocence by demonstrating the circumstances including the following \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.   12. I note that the Noticee had bought 4000 quantity of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s Stock Future on July 10, 2017 at 9:15 AM. I note that, on the same day, the disclosure of information relating to \\\\\\\\u201cUSFDA to Lift Import Alert 99-32 on the company's Unit-II at Visakhapatnam\\\\\\\\u201d, was made by Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s on the Stock Exchange platform at 11:50 AM. Thus, the impugned trades were executed by the Noticee approximately 2.5 hours before the UPSI becoming public. I also note that the Noticee has not disputed the impugnedFinal order in the matter of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s Laboratories Ltd.  Page 11 of 19  trades that were executed by him in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s as shown in Table 2 of the SCN.   13. While arguing on its part, the Noticee has contended that he has not received any UPSI and did not have access to any UPSI. I note that Regulation 4(2) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015, categorically states that the burden of proof to establish that a \\\\\\\\u2018Connected Person\\\\\\\\u2019 is not in possession of UPSI lies on the \\\\\\\\u2018Connected Person\\\\\\\\u2019. The reason for putting such burden of proof on the insider is because if an insider who is connected person with the company trades in the securities of that company when there was a UPSI, then it gives rise to a reasonable inference that such person has traded when in possession of UPSI, therefore, the burden of proving that he was not in possession of UPSI when he traded, is on such person. I note that the Noticee in the present matter has merely made a bald statement that he was not in possession of and did not have access to any UPSI without providing any corroborating evidence. I note that by virtue of being a \\\\\\\\u2018Connected Person\\\\\\\\u2019 coupled with his conduct that he took positions in the futures contracts of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s approximately 2.5 hours before the UPSI becoming public and thereafter squared off his position on UPSI becoming public, a strong presumption is created that the Connected Person, by virtue of his association with the Company during the past six months is reasonably expected to have access to UPSI. It is a fact that Noticee being an insider of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s being connected person, has traded in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s when there was a UPSI, therefore, in terms of Regulation 4(2) the burden of proving that while trading in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s, he was not in possession of UPSI, is on the Noticee. For a successful rebuttal, the Noticee ought to have produced supporting evidence for his claims. Thus, I find that the Noticee has not discharged the burden of proof as envisaged in Regulation 4(2) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015, to the effect that he was not in possession of UPSI. As a corollary, there is a reasonable inference that Noticee was in possession of UPSI.    14. On the other hand, I find that the Noticee was observed to report directly and frequently to Mr. Madhusudhana Rao Divi, whole time director at Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s. From the Annual Report of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s for the FY 2017-18, I find that Mr. Madhusudhana Rao Divi was inter alia responsible for activities relating to plant up-gradation to comply with FDA requirements, environment management and regulatory affairs at Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s. I findFinal order in the matter of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s Laboratories Ltd.  Page 12 of 19  that Mr. Madhusudhana Rao Divi came in possession of UPSI when he received the email from Mr. YTS Prasad - General Manager, on July 7 2017 at 8:23 am. By virtue of his frequent and direct reporting relationship to Mr. Madhusudhana Rao Divi, the Noticee who was posted in the Environment, Health and Safety Department at Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s, was reasonably expected to have access to UPSI. I note that the Noticee has not disputed his reporting relationship with Mr. Madhusudhana Rao Divi and he has also not presented any reliable explanation supported by cogent evidence of not having any access to the UPSI. Therefore, from the trading pattern of the Noticee which exhibits executing futures long position before the UPSI becoming public and futures short position after the UPSI is made public, coupled with his direct and frequent relationship with Mr.  Madhusudhana Rao Divi, who had access to UPSI, I find that the Noticee was in possession of UPSI when he traded in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s before it was disclosed to stock exchanges and became public.   15. Noticee has also contended that his trades in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s were independent of and not influenced by any UPSI. At this juncture, it would be appropriate to refer to the explanatory \\\\\\\\u2018Note\\\\\\\\u2019 to Regulation 4(1) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015, which reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNOTE: When a person  who  has  traded  in  securities  has  been  in  possession  of unpublished  price  sensitive  information,  his  trades  would  be presumed  to  have  been motivated  by  the  knowledge  and  awareness  of  such  information  in  his  possession\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d   16. From the aforesaid Note, it is clear that a presumption is created in law that the trading done by an \\\\\\\\u2018insider\\\\\\\\u2019 was motivated by the UPSI in his possession. However, such a presumption is a rebuttable presumption. In the present case, in para 14 I have already found that Noticee was in possession of UPSI when he traded in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s on July 10, 2017 at 9:15 am before it was disclosed to stock exchanges on July 10, 2017 at 11:50 am and became public. I find that the Noticee has not presented and reliable explanation supported by cogent evidence as to why he had traded in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s on July 10, 2017 when he was in possession of UPSI. Therefore, on the basis of the presumption envisaged in the explanatory note to Regulation 4(1) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015 and in the absence ofFinal order in the matter of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s Laboratories Ltd.  Page 13 of 19  a satisfactory explanation from the Noticee to successfully rebut the presumption, I find that the impugned trades made by the Noticee were motivated by the UPSI.   17. In view of the foregoing, I find that the Noticee being an \\\\\\\\u2018insider\\\\\\\\u2019 traded in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s when in possession of UPSI and therefore, the Noticee has violated Regulation 4(1) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015 and Section 12A(d) and 12A(e) of SEBI Act, 1992.   18. For the futures buy trades that were executed by the Noticee on July 10, 2017 when in possession of UPSI, the Noticee has also executed opposite futures sell trades on the following days i.e. on July 11, 2017, July 14, 2017 and July 18, 2017 (details mentioned at Table 3 above), thus, the SCN has alleged that by indulging in insider trading, the Noticee has made a notional wrongful gain of Rs. 1,83,000/. I note that the Noticee has not disputed the calculation of the amount of alleged notional wrongful gain as shown in Table 4 of the SCN, as reproduced in the pre-paras. Therefore, I find that having indulged in the act of insider trading, the Noticee is liable for directions for disgorgement of the amount of wrongful gain alongwith interest thereon.   Re: Whether Noticee has violated Disclosure Obligations:  19. The SCN has also alleged that the Noticee has failed to make the required disclosures as per Regulation 7(2)(a) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015. Regulation 7(2)(a) reads as under:  Disclosures by certain persons: (2) Continual Disclosures. (a) Every promoter, member of the  promoter  group, designated  person and director  of  every  company  shall  disclose  to  the  company  the  number  of  such securities  acquired  or  disposed  of  within  two  trading  days  of  such  transaction  if  the value  of  the  securities  traded,  whether  in  one  transaction  or  a  series  of  transactions over any calendar quarter, aggregates to a traded value in excess of ten lakh rupees or such other value as may be specified;  20. I note that in terms of the aforesaid provision, the Noticee, being a Designated Person at Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s and having executed trades in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s in the second quarter of 2017 over a value of Rs. 10 Lacs (see Table 4 above), was required toFinal order in the matter of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s Laboratories Ltd.  Page 14 of 19  disclose to the Company the number of such securities acquired or disposed of within two trading days of such transactions. However, as noted from the email dated August 27, 2019 written by Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s to SEBI during investigation, the Noticee has failed to make disclosure to the Company in respect of his trades. I also note that the Noticee in his reply dated July 29, 2020 had acknowledged that he had failed to make the required disclosure in terms of the aforesaid provision. Thus, I find that by not disclosing his futures trading in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s for his trades executed between July 10, 2017 to July 18, 2017, the Noticee has violated Regulation 7(2)(a) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015.   Re: Whether Noticee has committed violation of Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Designated Persons:  21. The SCN alleges that the Noticee has failed to obtain the pre-clearance for the buy and sell futures trades that were executed by him in the scrip of Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s, as was mandated by the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s \\\\\\\\u2018Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Insiders\\\\\\\\u2019 if the value of the trades exceeds Rs. 10 Lacs. I note that the \\\\\\\\u2018Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Insiders\\\\\\\\u2019 is framed by Divi\\\\\\\\u2019s pursuant to the minimum standards that are laid down in Schedule B of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015 readwith Regulation 9(1) of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015. The relevant extracts of the provisions of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015 are reproduced as under:  Code of Conduct. 9.(1) The board of directors  of  every  listed  company  and  market  intermediary  shall  formulate  a  code  of  conduct  to  regulate,  monitor  and  report  trading  by  its  employees  and  other  connected persons towards achieving compliance with these regulations, adopting the minimum standards  set  out  in  Schedule  B  to  these  regulations,  without  diluting  the  provisions  of  these  regulations in any manner.

SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  4. A Show Cause Notice dated March 12, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee under Rule 4(1) of the SEBI Adjudication Rules, Rule 4(1) of the Depositories Adjudication Rules and Rule 4(1) of the SCRA Adjudication Rules to show-cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against the Noticee and why penalty should not be imposed upon the NoticeePage 4 of 52   under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act, Section 19D of the Depositories Act, and Section 23D of the SCRA for the violations alleged to have been committed by the Noticee.  5. The following violations were alleged in the SCN to have been committed by the Noticee: Finding A: Non \\\\\\\\u2013Segregation of clients fund and Securities  i. Based on the principles and guidelines stipulated in clause 3 of SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated September 26, 2016, reconciliation of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds lying with the Noticee was done with the total available funds, i.e., cash and cash equivalents with the stock broker and with the clearing corporation/ clearing member to detect any mis-utilization of the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds. It was observed that, out of 57 sample days, the Noticee had misused client funds in 29 sample cases as the value of G, as specified in the above SEBI Circular dated September 26, 2016, is negative.

Besides, he confirmed in his statement that he knew Praveen Mohnot since December 2007 and since Hemant Patel was working in the same organization, he and Praveen Mohnot had several business _____________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KLG Capital Services Limited                                       Page 5 of 34  dealings and as such he and Praveen Mohnot needed to talk frequently.  (e) Hemant Patel was a party to the discussions held between Praveen Mohnot and N. Ravichandran, Deputy Chairman of SKIL, regarding acquisition of the company by APPL prior to the acquisition.  (f) The placements of orders by Hemant Patel (on behalf of Hemant Patel HUF) for buying shares of the company were around the same time when APPL placed orders for purchasing the shares of the company as part of its acquisition of KLG.  (g) Hemant Patel (on behalf of Hemant Patel HUF) had placed two orders for purchase of shares of KLG of value amounting to Rs. 26.16 lakh that resulted in trades worth Rs. 16.16 lakh on February 22, 2008. The value of the orders and trades on a single day were not in line with the value of his trades during October 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008. He had taken loan from Starwort Engineers Private Limited (\"SEPL\") specifically for buying the shares of the company. SEPL is an associate company of Horizon Infrastructure Limited (\"HIL\") of which APPL and SKIL are group companies.  (h) It was also observed that Priyanka Singhvi, daughter of Praveen Mohnot, andAnita Ravichandran, wife of N. Ravichandran, had taken loan from SEPL which was also used for buying shares of KLG around the same period Hemant Patel bought shares of KLG.  (i) Based on the above, SEBI found that Hemant R. Patel had received unpublished price sensitive information and had access to unpublished price sensitive information relating to the acquisition of the company by APPL before the said information became public. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KLG Capital Services Limited                                       Page 6 of 34  Hence, he was an insider according to Regulation 2 (e) of the PIT Regulations. Hemant R. Patel, being an insider, had dealt in the shares of KLG on behalf of Hemant R. Patel (HUF) and made an unjust enrichment of \\\\\\\\u20b942.58 lakh.  (j) Hemant R. Patel communicated UPSI to Praveen Mohnot and N. Ravichandran who subsequently communicated the information to Priyanka Singhvi and Anita Ravichandran respectively, who dealt in the scrip of KLG when in possession of the information.  B. Praveen Mahnot and Priyanka Singhvi: (a) Praveen Mohnot was Executive Director at SKIL. He had signed the MoU with NSBL, merchant banker/broker of APPL, and had dealt with NSBL for the open offer on behalf of APPL. He was party to the discussion, regarding acquisition of the company by APPL, held between Hemant Patel and N. Ravichandran, prior to the acquisition. Hemant Patel and N. Ravichandran were President-Business Development, SKIL and Deputy Chairman, SKIL respectively.  (b) Praveen Mahnot was in touch with Hemant Patel through telephone calls immediately preceding the acquisition. Hemant Patel has admitted in his statement recorded on August 13, 2008 that he had information about the impending sale of the company and on that information he along with Praveen Mahnot and N. Ravichandran took decision to buy shares of KLG. Hemant Patel also figured as contact person in the account opening document of APPL available with the stock broker NSBL. Amit Singh, an officer in NSBL, stock broker of APPL, has mentioned in his statement recorded with SEBI that \"we were in touch with only Mr. Hemant Patel and Mr. Devichand Nimbade about acquisition of shares of KLG Capital Services Ltd. by APPL.\" _____________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KLG Capital Services Limited                                       Page 7 of 34   (c) Girish Dev, CEO of NSBL, has indicated in his statement that \"The mandate for client APPL came to us through Shri Praveen Mohnot. Shri Mohnot was known to our Chairman Shri S.P. Jain from his earlier days. Shri Mohnot was in touch with us for this particular mandate in the sense that it was he who brought the deal to us from APPL/SKIL side.\" Praveen Mohnot possessing the unpublished price sensitive information was further confirmed by the statement of Hemant Patel that \"I had information about impending sale of KLG and on that information I alongwith N Ravichandran and Praveen Mohnot took the decision to buy shares of KLG\".  (d) Praveen Mohnot had communicated the unpublished price sensitive information to his daughter Priyanka Singhvi. This is confirmed by her statement dated August 13, 2008 recorded at SEBI, where she stated that \"I have also discussed with my father before I made the decision to purchase the shares of KLG...Quantity of shares to be purchased and, price was decided by me in consultation with my family. We then decided to take a loan for this purpose, since we did not have the necessary liquidity. Thereafter, I informed my father who also agreed with the same and also arranged for the loan.\"  (e) The placements of orders by Praveen Mohnot\\\\\\\\u2019s daughter for buying securities of the company were also around the time APPL placed orders for purchasing the securities of the company as part of its acquisition of KLG. His daughter purchased shares of the company for more than Rs. 37.25 lakh which was not in line with her trading history between October 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008.  (f) Praveen Mohnot arranged for loan for his daughter specifically for buying the securities of the company from Starwort Engineers Pvt. Ltd.(\"SEPL\") which is an associate _____________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KLG Capital Services Limited                                       Page 8 of 34  company of HIL of which APPL and SKIL are group companies. It was also observed that Hemant Patel and Anita Ravichandran, wife of N. Ravichandran, had taken loans from SEPL which was also used for buying shares of KLG during the same period when Praveen Mohnot\\\\\\\\u2019s daughter was observed to be buying shares of KLG.  (g) Based on the above, SEBI found that Praveen  Mohnot had received unpublished price sensitive information and had access to unpublished price sensitive information relating to the acquisition of the company by APPL before the said information became public. Further, Priyanka Singhvi had received UPSI from her father, Praveen Mohnot. Hence, Praveen Mohnot and Priyanka Singhvi were insiders according to Regulation 2 (e) of the PIT Regulations. Priyanka Singhvi dealt in the scrip of KLG while in possession of such information and made unjust enrichment of \\\\\\\\u20b973.84 lakh against part selling of 81,237 shares of KLG till June 08, 2012 and held 28,673 shares of KLG as on June 08, 2012.  C. N. Ravichandran and Anita Ravichandran: (a) N. Ravichandran, was the Deputy Chairman of SKIL. He was a party to the discussion held between Hemant Patel and Praveen Mohnot, who were President-Business Development and Executive Director of SKIL respectively, regarding acquisition of the company by APPL. He was in touch with Hemant Patel and Praveen Mohnot through telephone calls/SMSs during the period 15.01.08 to 15.06.08. Hemant Patel has admitted in his statement recorded on August 13, 2008 that he had information about the impending sale of the company and on that information, Hemant Patel along with Praveen Mohnot and N. Ravichandran took decision to buy shares of KLG. Hemant Patel also figured as contact person in the account opening document of APPL available with APPL's stock broker/merchant banker, NSBL. Praveen Mohnot had signed the Memorandum of _____________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KLG Capital Services Limited                                       Page 9 of 34  Understanding with NSBL on behalf of APPL before the acquisition of the company.  (b) N. Ravichandran was in touch with Devichand Nimbade, who was designated as authorized person by APPL in its KYC documents filed with NSBL. Devichand Nimbade was in touch with Amit Singh regarding the acquisition of shares of the company. Amit Singh was an officer in NSBL (stock broker/merchant banker of APPL) and has stated in his statement recorded with SEBI that \"we were in touch with only Mr. Hemant Patel and Mr. Devichand Nimbade about acquisition of shares of KLG Capital Services Ltd. by APPL.\"  (c) N. Ravichandran possessing the unpublished price sensitive information is also confirmed by the statement of Hemant Patel that \"I had information about impending sale of KLG and on that information I alongvvith N Ravichandran and Praveen Mohnot took the decision to buy shares of KLG\".  (d) The placements of orders by N. Ravichandran\\\\\\\\u2019s wife, Anita Ravichandran, for buying shares of the company were around the same time APPL placed orders for purchasing the shares of the company as part of its acquisition of KL.G.  (e) Anita Ravichandran, the wife of N. Ravichandran, purchased shares of the company for Rs. 26.16 lakh which was not in line with her trading history between October 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008.  (f) N. Ravichandran arranged loan for his wife for buying the securities of the company from SEPL which is an associate company of HIL of which APPL and SKIL are group companies. This was confirmed by her statement dated August 14, 2008, where she stated _____________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KLG Capital Services Limited                                       Page 10 of 34  that \"I borrowed funds for the purchase of the shares from Chetan Kothari of Starwort Engg. Pvt Ltd. My husband had arranged for the loan as he knew Chetan Kothari. The broker never asked for funds from me for any purchase. I have never done any monetary transactions with my broker. Such things are dealt with, by my husband.\"  (g) It was observed that Hemant Patel and Priyanka Singhvi, daughter of Mr. Praveen Mohnot, too had taken loan from SEPL which was also used for buying shares of KLG during the same period when Anita Ravichandran (wife of N. Ravichandran) was observed to be buying shares of KLG.  (h) Based on the above, SEBI found that N. Ravichandran and Anita Ravichandran had received unpublished price sensitive information and had access to unpublished price sensitive information relating to the acquisition of the company by APPL before the said information became public. Hence, they were insiders according to Regulation 2 (e) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992. N. Ravichandran, being an insider had communicated the UPSI to his wife Anita Ravichandran, who dealt in the scrip of KLG while in possession of such information and made unjust enrichment of \\\\\\\\u20b954.61 lakh.  D. Relationship between APPL, SKIL, HIL and SEPL and the Noticees: (a) SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s investigation revealed that APPL, SKIL, HIL and SEPL belonged to SKIL group. Both APPL and SKIL are group companies of HIL. APPL and SKIL are also promoter group entities of HIL.  (b) Hemant R. Patel, Praveen Mohnot and N. Ravichandran belonged to SKIL Group. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KLG Capital Services Limited                                       Page 11 of 34  3. Based on the above, the Noticees were alleged to have violated Section 12A(d) and (e) of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3(i), 3(ii) and 4 of the PIT Regulations. After considering the facts of the case and the replies filed by the Noticees, SEBI passed an order dated July 24, 2014 (Second SEBI Order) whereby it concluded that the Noticees had violated the provisions of the SEBI Act and the PIT Regulations. Vide the Second SEBI Order, SEBI inter alia directed that the Noticees shall not buy, sell or deal in or access the securities market in any manner whatsoever and shall not hold position of director in a listed company for 10 years. Further, Hemant R. Patel & Hemant R. Patel (HUF), Priyanka Singhvi and Anita Ravichandran were directed to disgorge the unlawful gains made by them, along with interest.  4. The Noticees again filed appeals against the Second SEBI Order before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT wherein they inter alia contended that the Second SEBI Order was violative of the principles of natural justice on the ground that the said order was passed without giving an opportunity of hearing on merits and also on ground that the said order was passed after 11 months of granting of personal hearing. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT vide an order dated February 05, 2015 quashed and set aside the Second SEBI Order and remanded the matter back to SEBI for passing common order on the preliminary issue as to whether the show cause notice dated December 27, 2012 was contrary to the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT dated October 21, 2010 and also on merits. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, while holding that all contentions on both sides were to be kept open, also directed the Noticees to intimate to SEBI, list of documents, inspection of which they sought and also the list of persons whom they wanted to cross examine.   PERSONAL HEARINGS AND REPLIES: 5. Subsequently, the proceedings were continued against the Noticees in accordance with the directions of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, on the basis of charges mentioned in the SCNs dated December _____________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KLG Capital Services Limited                                       Page 12 of 34  27, 2012. Accordingly, inspection of various documents and cross examination of certain persons were provided to the Noticees on various dates. Further, personal hearings were also provided to the Noticees on April 26, 2018, July 12, 2018 and October 11, 2018. During the personal hearing on April 26, 2018, it was specifically clarified by SEBI to the Noticees that SEBI was relying entirely upon the SCNs dated December 27, 2012 and that the same superseded the previous SCNs issued to the Noticees. It was further clarified to them that no fresh SCN would be issued to them in the matter.   6. Post the setting aside of the Second SEBI Order, the Noticees vide their individual letters of different dates have submitted fresh replies to the SCN dated December 27, 2012. The Noticees vide their letters dated September 06, 2018, September 28, 2018, October 04, 2018 November 01, 2018 and November 30, 2018 submitted inter alia the following:  (a) All the allegations against the Noticees are denied. The Noticees refer to all the submissions made earlier to SEBI. (b) The non-availability of cross examination of two persons has broken the continuity of events based upon which the charges in the SCN have been made. (c) The SCN is based on assumptions and presumptions which are not supported by facts or evidence. (d) The SCN does not specifically state as to what is alleged to be UPSI, but in some ways insinuates that the UPSI was the \\\\\\\\u201cacquisition of the company by APPL. \\\\\\\\u201cThe Company\\\\\\\\u201d is defined in the SCN to mean KLG. The SCN itself alleges that a Public Announcement was made in respect of this alleged UPSI on February 28, 2008 after the \"acquisition' of 60.46% of the shares of KLG by APPL on February 27, 2008. Therefore, admittedly after this date there was no UPSI. However, the said SCN does not even allege that any Share _____________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KLG Capital Services Limited                                       Page 13 of 34  Purchase Agreement (SPA) was concluded on any date prior to February 27, 2008 or that for any other reasons, it can be held that there was any UPSI prior to February 27, 2008. In the absence of any such allegations and evidence to support the same, it cannot be alleged that there was any UPSI on February 22, 2008, being the date on which Priyanka Singhvi, Anita Ravichandran and Hemant Patel HUF are alleged to have purchased shares from the market. (e) The SCN does not disclose as to when and how this UPSI of the acquisition of KLG by APPL came into existence. It does not even allege that any such UPSI existed prior to 27.02.22008. Consequently, it cannot be alleged that there was any UPSI on the date of the purchase of shares by the Noticees on 22.02.2008. (f) The SCN does not disclose the list of persons who were aware of the alleged UPSI, nor does it disclose any evidence or material for the same. There are no allegations as to who allegedly was party to the negotiations of the said acquisition of shares of KLG by APPL nor does the SCN even allege as to who in APPL were involved in the decision making process for the acquisition of the said shares of KLG. (g) The said SCN merely relies upon various statements, but primarily on the statements of Hemant Patel. However, from Hemant Patel\\\\\\\\u2019s statement, it is obvious that he had only stated that he was aware that K. L. Garg of KLG was \"looking for some investor\" to whom he could sell his stake in KLG. Hemant Patel never stated that he was aware that APPL was going to purchase K.L. Garg's stake in KLG. Therefore, as far as Hemant Patel was aware, K.L. Garg had not even identified a purchaser, and was still only looking for some investor. In fact, Hemant Patel in the same statement has also expressly recorded that- \"...I was not associated with APPL in any capacity. I came to know of KLG acquisition by APPL only after Share Purchase Agreement was signed between Shri K L Garg and APPL.\" (h) It is indisputable that mere knowledge that K.L. Garg was \"looking for some investor\" _____________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KLG Capital Services Limited                                       Page 14 of 34  cannot be termed as UPSI, nor is it even alleged in the said SCN that the same amounts to UPSI since the said SCN insinuates that the UPSI was the \"... acquisition of the company by APPL...\". Given this admitted factual position, it can never be contended that the Noticees had any UPSI, or it was communicated or that the decision of the said Noticees to trade in the shares was on the basis of any UPSI or while in possession of any UPSI as falsely alleged. (i) SEBI is relying on the statements of Hemant Patel, Praveen Mohnot and N. Ravichandran, as being the foundation of the charge of Insider Trading. However, all three statements corroborate that none of them were aware that APPL was proposing to acquire KLG and that the only information they had was that KLG or its promoter was looking for prospective investors; i.e. that they had not even identified any purchaser. Hemant Patel, N. Ravichandran and Praveen Mohnot have corroborated in their statement that they were not aware of the impending takeover. Mere knowledge that some party is looking to sell shares of a company, can never amount to UPSI, and trading on the basis of such information can never amount to a charge of \"insider trading\" as alleged. Therefore, it can never be alleged that there was any UPSI known to the Noticee and/or to any of the said Noticees at the relevant time or that any UPSI was communicated by/to anyone or that the said Noticees traded on the basis of or while in possession of any UPSI. (j) The fact that prior to the acquisition of the shares on February 27, 2008 there was no UPSI that existed at all is also proved by the fact that KLG neither closed its trading window as per its Code of Conduct under the said Regulations nor disclosed to the stock exchanges the intended acquisition of KLG by APPL, as a material information in terms of listing agreement. In this regard, it is pertinent to refer to the order of Hon'ble SAT in the matter of Factorial Master Fund v. SEBI passed in June 2018. The fact that mere knowledge that _____________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KLG Capital Services Limited                                       Page 15 of 34  KLG\\\\\\\\u2019s promoter was looking for someone to buy up his shares does not amount to any UPSI at all is also substantiated by the Order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Factorial Master Fund. (k) It is also pertinent to note that at the relevant time, the sale of shares by a promoter could not have been alleged to be UPSI. The definition of \\\\\\\\u201cPrice sensitive information\\\\\\\\u201d as provided under Regulation 2 (ha) of the PIT Regulations as applicable then and the explanation provided therein both make it amply clear that the \"information\" had to relate to the internal working of 'the company\". Mere knowledge of the fact that a promoter / share-holder was looking for an investor could not be alleged to be price sensitive information at all. (l) It is settled law that whatever is not prohibited by law is permitted. Therefore, even if it is assumed for the sake of argument and without admitting the allegations in the said SCN that the impugned transactions were executed with the knowledge that K.L. Garg was looking for an investor, the same would not amount to any violation of the PIT Regulations as applicable at the relevant time.  (m) Without prejudice to any of the other submissions, even as a matter of fact, the said acquisition of the shares of KLG by APPL, was not \"price sensitive\". The same is proved by the fact that even after the public announcement of the same on February 28, 2008, the price of the scrip of KLG was barely affected by such information. In fact, immediately after the said purchases of shares on February 22, 2008 and immediately after the said information was made public by the said announcement on February 28, 2008, the price of the said scrip of KLG actually fell marginally (closing price on 28.02.2008 was lower by 95 Paise than the closing price of the scrip on 27.02.2008). This is despite the fact that the price trend was upwards. It is therefore obvious that what the SCN alleges to be the UPSI was in fact not even \"price sensitive information\" as a matter of _____________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of KLG Capital Services Limited                                       Page 16 of 34  demonstrable fact, and the full public disclosure of the alleged UPSI barely affected the prices. Therefore, the allegations in the said SCN are totally incorrect and unsustainable. (n) The allegation in the SCN is that the Noticees were \"... connected person to the company...and reasonable expected to have access to the Unpublished Price Sensitive Information, hence an insider of the Company.. .\\\\\\\\u201d  The SCN defines \"the Company\" as being KLG. However, all allegations of 'connection\" are in respect of the Noticee's alleged connections to the \"SKIL Group\", of which APPL is a part. The SCN does not contain a single particular / fact to show any alleged 'connection\", between the Noticees and KLG at any time prior to February 27, 2008, being the date on which APPL allegedly acquired 60.46% of KLG. In fact, the SCN does not even attempt to make out any \"connection\" or any 'deemed connection\" between the Noticees and APPL. (o) The investigation conducted by SEBI is materially defective since the same is based on mere surmises and conjectures through improbable connections. The Noticees did not deal in the shares of APPL at any point in time nor did they know the concerned officials who were handling the operations of the Brokers. The Noticees have therefore been repeatedly raising the legitimate issue that the said SCN does not in any manner demonstrate as to how it is alleged that the said Noticees were connected or deemed to be connected to KLG. (p) It is also pertinent to note that APPL is an unlisted private limited company and the PIT Regulations do not apply to it. Realizing this, the SCN defines \"the company\" as being KLG. However, since there was no connection or deemed connection between the Noticee and KLG, the allegation in the said SCN is that they were connected to APPL. However, as stated aforesaid, there was no UPSI at the relevant time and the PIT Regulations did not apply to APPL.

Moreover, from the merchant details submitted by Avenues (India) Pvt. Ltd.

No. 50200011186011) and Axis Bank (A/c No. 915020049484055). The transactions observed in the abovementioned bank accounts are summarized as under:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Profit Mount Advisory Service                                                             Page 5 of 15  Transaction Period Bank Name and account number No. of transactions Amount Collected in Rs.

From the analysis of Bank statements, the following is observed: 5.6.1. The bank accounts are active. 5.6.2. The total credit received in the aforesaid accounts is approximately Rs. 40.92 lakh during the period April 16, 2015 to November 17, 2020. 5.6.3. It is observed that there are 546 credit transactions received in the said bank accounts. From the narrative of the transactions, it appears that the payments have, prima facie, come from various investors / clients. An illustrative list of narrations in the HDFC Bank account of the firm is as under: Transaction Date Narration Credit (Rs.) 28/7/2017 IMPS-720907444556-NAUSHAD I ANSARI-HDFC-XXXXXXXX2426-OPTION AND PUT 8,000 11/9/2017 IMPS-725421189561-DIBIN KOSHY SAMUEL-HDFC-XXXXXXXXXX7313-SUBSCRIPTION FEE 7,000 15/2/2018 50200025945519  - TPT-PREMIUM FUTURE SANDIP 10,000 26/2/2018 50200025945519  - TPT-STOCK OPTION FOR SUMIT 8,000  6. In light of the aforesaid discussions, I prima facie observe, based on the contents of firm\\\\\\\\u2019s website wherein various services offered by the firm has been described, that Profit Mount Advisory Service is prima facie, holding itself out as an investment adviser. Further, it is also prima facie, observed from the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s webpages that it offers various tips / services to its clients in the securities market through SMSs, G-talk and phone including live support and follow ups for all entry and exit calls. Considering the above facts and circumstances, especially the content of the website of the firm coupled with the credit transactions in the bank accounts, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees / funds credited to the bank accounts, were for the purpose of availing the services indicated on the website of Profit Mount Advisory Service.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Profit Mount Advisory Service                                                             Page 6 of 15  7. In this factual context, I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d  8. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is observed from the contents of the website of the firm that the firm is prima facie holding itself out as investment adviser by offering to provide investment advice as defined under regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations by offering to give advice related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription. Further, as noted from the bank accounts that there are multiple credit entries which when seen together with the contents of the website leads to the prima facie conclusion that the credit entries in the bank accounts are for consideration for the investment advice given by the firm to its clients. Thus, prima facie, the firm is an investment adviser as defined under regulation 2 (m) of IA Regulations.  9. Further, the fact that the firm, in its account opening form with HDFC Bank and the details submitted to the payment gateway, has mentioned that its business activity is providing advisory service in securities market, coupled with the various subscription packages offered by the firm in various segments of the market viz, equity, derivatives and commodity, when seen in light of the receipt of money in its bank accounts, is an acknowledgment / admission that the credit of money is in fact the fee for the investment advisory services rendered by the firm. Therefore, the firm has not only held itself out as investment adviser but has also acted as an investment adviser for consideration.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Profit Mount Advisory Service                                                             Page 7 of 15  Issue No. 2: If answer to aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether Profit Mount Advisory Service has, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act read with IA Regulations? 10. In order to ensure that investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of SEBI Act reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d Further, as per regulation 3(1) of IA Regulations, the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.  11. The activities of the firm, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that Profit Mount Advisory Service was holding itself out as an investment adviser and also has been acting as an investment adviser. However, no material is available on record to indicate that Profit Mount Advisory Service or its proprietor, Mr. M Ashok Kumar in his individual capacity has a certificate of registration as investment adviser. In this context, it is noted that Profit Mount Advisory Service or its proprietor, Mr. M Ashok Kumar in his individual capacity, is not registered with SEBI in any capacity. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by Profit Mount Advisory Service, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, leads to the conclusion that Profit Mount Advisory Service is holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser without a certificate of registration from SEBI. In my view, these activities/ representations of Profit Mount__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Profit Mount Advisory Service                                                             Page 8 of 15  Advisory Service are, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations. 12. It is observed from the website of the firm that it has mentioned on its website that it is not registered with SEBI. The said statement, however, does not absolve the firm from complying with the mandatory provisions of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations which state in unequivocal terms that no person shall act or hold itself as an investment adviser without obtaining a certificate of registration from SEBI. In the given facts and circumstances of the case, it has been prima facie, observed in preceding paragraphs that the firm is holding out as well as acting as an investment adviser. The same necessarily entails that the firm has to obtain a certificate of registration from SEBI which as noted from records, the firm has failed to obtain.  Issue No. 3: If answers to issue nos. (4.1) & (4.2) are affirmative, who are responsible for the violations? 13. I note that Mr. M. Ashok Kumar is the sole proprietor of Profit Mount Advisory Service. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in Ashok Transport Agency vs. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business.  A suit by or against a proprietary concern is by or against the proprietor of the business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Mr. M. Ashok Kumar is liable for the acts and omissions of Profit Mount Advisory Service. Issue No. 4: If answer to issue no. 4.2 is in affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any, should be issued against those responsible for the prima facie, violations?  14. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. IA Regulations has been formulated with the main objective of regulating investment advisory activities to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of investment advisory activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations, inter alia, seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Profit Mount Advisory Service                                                             Page 9 of 15  also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the criteria set out in the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market.  15. In the instant case, Profit Mount Advisory Service is soliciting and inducing investors to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips, intra-day calls etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration / certification as mandated under the IA Regulations. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Profit Mount Advisory Service through its proprietor, from collecting any more fees from the public and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. It is noted from material available on record that the last transaction in the bank account of Profit Mount Advisory Service is in the month of November, 2020 (HDFC Bank). Moreover, the website of the firm is active as on date. Furthermore, the details of the firm including its email and telephone number are mentioned on its website. Mr. M Ashok Kumar, vide his email dated July 8, 2019 had inter-alia, submitted that he has stopped the investment advisory activity and attached a screen shot in relation to the closure of the Profit Mount Advisory Service website. However, as noted, the website of the firm is still active. Thus, Mr. M Ashok Kumar had only temporarily closed the website. This act of Mr. M Ashok Kumar, prima facie, shows that he is determined in continuing his unregistered investment advisory activities. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Profit Mount Advisory Service in the securities market is still in existence and imminent. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Profit Mount Advisory Service is Rs. 40,92,886/- and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.  16. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from the unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from registered investment advisor in consonance with the IA Regulations vis-a-vis an investor who receives such service from unregistered investment adviser stands__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Profit Mount Advisory Service                                                             Page 10 of 15  at a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged under the IA regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment adviser.  Availing of service from such persons is detrimental to investors and such unqualified service results in irreparable detriment as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victim of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury/detriment to the development of the securities market also qualifies as an \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d. The objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market. 17. Further if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may have to part away with large fees and investment resulting into irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is right of the current entity herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the ex-parte orders in the case of private suits and ex-parte public enforcement actions, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential deployment of funds by the investors by following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if, prima facie, unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing an ex-parte interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favour of the entity.   18. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Profit Mount Advisory Service from collecting any more funds from the public and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Profit Mount Advisory Service                                                             Page 11 of 15  activities. As noted in the preceding paragraphs, monies were being credited in the bank account of the firm as on November, 2020 and its bank accounts are still active. Moreover, the website of the firm is active. The same prima facie demonstrates that Profit Mount Advisory Service can still lure investors to deal through it in the securities market and probability of investors reaching Profit Mount Advisory Service is still high. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Profit Mount Advisory Service in the securities market is still in existence and imminent.  19. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Profit Mount Advisory Service is approximately Rs. 40.92 lakh and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors. In light of the same, I find that there is no other alternative but to take recourse through an interim ex-parte order against Profit Mount Advisory Service and its proprietor for preventing them from collecting funds by indulging in unauthorized investment advisory services without obtaining the mandatory registrations from SEBI in accordance with the law. As the website of the firm is active which prima facie, shows that the investors can reach it and also its bank accounts are active, the balance of convenience demands the preventive measure of stopping the collection of money in the bank accounts of the firm from investors. The same can be effectively achieved by an appropriate direction of stopping credit into the bank account of the firm. As Profit Mount Advisory Service and its proprietor have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, the balance of convenience also demands that Profit Mount Advisory Service and its proprietor have to be prevented from diverting the funds collected from the investors through unauthorized investment advisory activity. Accordingly, an appropriate direction stopping the debit from the bank account of the firm and its proprietor have been incorporated.  20. With the initiation of quasi-judicial proceedings and the given the fact that Profit Mount Advisory Service and its proprietor has already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI, it is imminent that the firm and its proprietor may divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients. The same may result in defeating the effective implementation of the direction of refund, if any, to be passed after deciding the matter on merits. It therefore becomes necessary for SEBI to take urgent steps to prevent the firm and its__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Profit Mount Advisory Service                                                             Page 12 of 15  proprietor from diverting the money collected from the subscribers / clients. It is also essential to take urgent steps to prevent them from alienating any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets, so that the final remedies, if any, do not become infructuous. In view of the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove, and considering the interests of already existing clients of the firm and its proprietor and also the interests of those who may fall prey to the unregistered investment advisory by reaching the firm through email or telephone, the balance of convenience lies against the firm and its proprietor, which requires immediate action against them including not to divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients / investors.   ORDER  21.

Considering the analysis of the details on the website of Eprofitzone and information from the accounts opened with the banks and payment gateway, I, prima facie, observe that Eprofitzone has represented that it is an investment advisory firm that provides tips for the stock and commodity markets.  13. Considering the above facts and circumstances, especially the contents of the website of Eprofitzone coupled with the credit transactions in the bank accounts, directly and through PayUMoney, as detailed above, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees/ funds credited to the bank account, were for the purpose of providing the services indicated on the website of Eprofitzone. Hence, as reflected from the bank statement, I note that Eprofitzone has commenced with the collection of fees/ funds for the purpose of providing the services from December 2016 and has continued the same, at least till the period of examination.  14. It is, prima facie, observed that Eprofitzone is placing information about various services offered by it in the securities market in public domain by using its website. Further, it is also, prima facie, observed that various packages are being offered by Eprofitzone through its website to avail its services. The website categorically mentions the \\\\\\\\u201cadvantages of availing its services\\\\\\\\u201d in various fields of securities market and the advice they offer to their clients in the securities market through daily SMSs.  15. In this regard, I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Eprofitzone Fincap Consultant Private Limited    Page 9 of 20 16. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is, prima facie, observed from the contents of the website that Eprofitzone is holding itself out as investment adviser by offering to provide services related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription and as such, these services fall within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advice\\\\\\\\u201d under Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations. Further, multiple credit entries have been received in the bank accounts and through PayUMoney, which when seen together with the contents of the website, leads to, on preponderance of probability basis, a, prima facie, conclusion that the credit entries in the bank account are for consideration for the investment advice given by Eprofitzone to its clients. Thus, prima facie, Eprofitzone is an investment adviser as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations.  17. Therefore, Eprofitzone has not only held itself out as an investment adviser but has also acted as an investment adviser for consideration.  Issue No.2: If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether Eprofitzone has, prima facie, violated any provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) read with SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (\\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d)?  18. In order to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Eprofitzone Fincap Consultant Private Limited    Page 10 of 20 with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  19. Further, as per Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.  20. It is noted that Eprofitzone is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of an investment adviser, while the characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by it, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, lead to the conclusion that it is holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser. However, no material is available on record to indicate that Eprofitzone or its directors, Mr. Prakash Kumar and Mr. Ajit Kumar, in their individual capacity, have a certificate of registration as investment adviser. In this context, it is also noted that Eprofitzone and its directors, Mr. Prakash Kumar and Mr. Ajit Kumar, in their individual capacity, are not registered with SEBI in any capacity.  21. In my view, these activities/ representations of Eprofitzone without holding the certificate of registration as an investment adviser is, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.  Issue No.3: If answers to Issue Nos. (1) & (2) are affirmative, who are all responsible for the violations?  22. I note that as per MCA records, the directors of Eprofitzone are as below:  DIN Name Appointment Date Cessation Date 0007610258 Prakash Kumar 04/10/2016 Continuing 0007610806 Ajit Kumar 04/10/2016 Continuing__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Eprofitzone Fincap Consultant Private Limited    Page 11 of 20 23. I note that any company though a legal entity cannot act by itself, it can act only through its Directors. They are expected to exercise their power on behalf of the company with utmost care, skill and diligence. In terms of Section 179 of the Companies Act, 2013, the Board of Directors of a company shall be entitled to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as the company is authorized to exercise and do. Therefore, the Board of Directors, being responsible for the conduct of the business of a company, are liable for any non-compliance of law and such liability shall be upon the individual Directors also.  24. I note for the contravention of law committed by the company, apart from the company, the directors of company who at the time of contravention, were having knowledge of the said contravention or their neglect results in the said contravention of law, are also liable for said contravention of law committed by the company.  25. In the instant matter, as per material available on record, I find that that the core activities/ objective of Eprofitzone is to carry on business in securities market as investment adviser. Further, as per material available on record, I also find that apart from investment advisory business, Eprofitzone is not involved in any other business. It is already established in the preceding paragraphs that the company is carrying investment advisory activities without obtaining certificate of registration from SEBI.  26. Thus, the preponderance of the probability indicates that all directors of the company had knowledge and awareness of providing investment advisory services by the company to its clients without obtaining certificate of registration from SEBI. I also note that the liability of the directors also arises if the contravention is attributable to any neglect on the part of them. There is no material on record to indicate that the directors have taken any due diligence efforts to prevent the contravention of running un-registered investment advisory activity by way of making application to SEBI. It shows there is a neglect attributable on the directors.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Eprofitzone Fincap Consultant Private Limited    Page 12 of 20 27. The preponderance of probability indicates that all the directors, regarding the instant contravention, stand on the same footing as they have the knowledge or they have not taken due diligence efforts to apply for registration, i.e., they have neglected in making the application for registration. Therefore, the extent of liability of each director is same as that of the other director. The extent of the liability vested on one director is not minimized in view of the presence of the other director with similar liability. Since every director has failed to discharge its liability, their liability is not only joint but also several in the instant case.  28. Thus, I am of the view that both the directors of Eprofitzone, Mr. Prakash Kumar and Mr. Ajit Kumar, are jointly and severally liable for any contravention of law committed by the company.  29. It is pertinent to mention that Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations stipulates that no person shall act/ hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he obtains a certificate of registration from the Board in accordance with the regulations. The SEBI Act, along with the IA Regulations, provides for various remedies in the interest of investor protection. Section 11B of the SEBI Act, being one of the pivotal measure for the purpose of investor protection, is the section under which the remedial tool of refund is envisaged. The SEBI Act has also prescribed other set of measures under Section 11B of the SEBI Act. The said measures can include direction to refund the amount collected from the investors/ clients for its services. While the primary responsibility for refund of amount collected from the investors lies on the company, it does not absolve the obligation of the directors, who collected the money on behalf of the company by causing the company to indulge in unregistered investment advisory activities, to refund the amount collected. Therefore, the directors who collected the money on behalf of the company are also liable under Section 11B of the SEBI Act to refund the money collected by them, during their tenure of directorship as mentioned above. Accordingly, the amounts collected are liable to be refunded jointly and severally by the company and by the directors in their personal__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Eprofitzone Fincap Consultant Private Limited    Page 13 of 20 capacity. As stated earlier, the liability of the directors is independent and the same can be enforced by way of direction to make refund under Section 11B of SEBI Act.   30. In the instant case, I have already found that Eprofitzone has indulged in investment advisory services without obtaining a certificate of registration from SEBI, thereby contravening the provisions of Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 3(1) of the PMS Regulations. I note that Eprofitzone has collected an amount of Rs. 3,35,13,233/- from investors/ clients. From the material available on record, it is noted that Mr. Prakash Kumar and Mr. Ajit Kumar were directors of Eprofitzone during the period it was, prima facie, found to be involved in providing unregistered investment advisory services. Hence, I am of the view that they are liable to make refund of the amount collected from the clients/ investors during their tenure.   31. In view of the above, I hold that the Directors of Eprofitzone, Mr. Prakash Kumar and Mr. Ajit Kumar, are responsible for the above mentioned acts of the company.  Issue No. 4: If answer to Issue No. (2) is affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any, should be issued against those responsible for the violations?  32. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of regulating activities related to investment advice to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration for such activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations, inter alia, seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the criteria set out in the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Eprofitzone Fincap Consultant Private Limited    Page 14 of 20 33. In the instant case, Eprofitzone is soliciting/ inducing members of the public to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration/certification as mandated under the IA Regulations. Further, it is noted from material available on record, that the website is active as on date and money has been credited to the bank accounts even recently during the period of examination. Thus, the entity and its bank account is active and can continue to be used to collect fees from unsuspecting members of the public.   34. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the, prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Eprofitzone from collecting any more fees from the public and from indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. I note that the website is active as on date. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered services provided by Eprofitzone in the securities market is still in existence and imminent. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Eprofitzone is Rs. 3,35,13,233/- and the same indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.  35. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from an unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from unregistered investment advisor vis-a-vis an investor who receives such service from a SEBI registered investment adviser stands at a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged under the IA Regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not even satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment adviser. Availing such services from unregistered entities is detrimental to investors and such unregistered service would result in irreparable damage as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Eprofitzone Fincap Consultant Private Limited    Page 15 of 20 securities market, as victims of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury/ detriment to the development of the securities market also qualifies as an \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d. The objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market.  36. Further, if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may have to part with large fees and investments resulting into irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is the right of the current entity herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the ex-parte orders in the case of private suits and ex-parte public enforcement actions, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential deployment of funds by the investors by following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if, prima facie, unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing an ex-parte-interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favor of Eprofitzone and its Directors.    37. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the, prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Eprofitzone and its Directors from collecting any more fees from the public and from indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Eprofitzone Fincap Consultant Private Limited    Page 16 of 20 38. I note that the amount of Rs. 3,35,13,233/- has been collected in the bank accounts of Eprofitzone. In light of the same, I find that there is no other alternative but to take recourse through an interim ex-parte order against Eprofitzone and its Directors, Mr. Ajit Kumar and Mr. Prakash Kumar, for preventing them from collecting funds by indulging in unauthorized investment advisory services without obtaining the mandatory registrations from SEBI in accordance with the law. As the website and bank account is active, the balance of convenience demands the preventive measure of stopping the collection of money from investors in the bank accounts belonging to Eprofitzone, which can be achieved by an appropriate direction of stopping the credit into these bank accounts.

Minance Technologies Private Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cMTPL\\\\\\\\u201d) was incorporated on September 28, 2016. MTPL was registered as Authorised Person of Angel Broking Private Limited having registration Number AP0397141543 (NSE) and AP0106120161034 (BSE). Its registered address is at No.35/37 (old no.598), 2nd floor, 11th Main Road, Jayanagar, 5th Block, Bangalore, Karnataka, India, 560041.   2. Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) received complaints against MTPL inter alia alleging that it indulged in unregistered Portfolio Manager activities. Pursuant to the Complaints, SEBI carried out an examination to ascertain whether unregistered portfolio management activities are being carried out by MTPL. The preliminary ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 2 of 17  examination entailed inter alia an analysis of investor complaints, reply of the Company, information available on the website of the entities and their bank statements etc. 3. SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s preliminary examination brought out the following: 3.1 As per the information available on MCA portal, Anurag Bhatia, Soham Soumya Sarkar and Adhiraj singh are/were directors of MTPL.  3.2 Mr. Anurag Bhatia vide his email dated December 12, 2019 stated that MTPL was providing Portfolio Management Services since February 2017.  3.3 The present website of the Minance group is minance.com. The content of the said website did not indicate any portfolio management activity.  3.4 The entity had another website minancecapital.com. The said website is not active and the same was accessed from archive.org and the printouts of the webpages are placed on record. As per the said website, the entity provides managed account service (MAS).  3.5  The entity is not registered with SEBI in any capacity  4. I have perused the materials available on record such as investor complaints, information obtained from various Banks and information gathered from website, etc. An   examination of the material available on record was made in order to verify whether MTPL offered Portfolio Management Services and collected money from various investors without registration from SEBI.  In this context, the following prima facie issues arise for determination in the instant matter:  i. Whether the activities of MTPL are in the nature of Portfolio Management Services? ii. If answer to issue No. (i) is in affirmative, whether, prima facie, MTPL violated the provisions of section 12(1) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 3 of the PMS Regulations? iii. If answer to issue No. (ii) is in affirmative, who are all responsible for the violations? iv. If answer to issue No. (ii) is in affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any should be issued against them? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 3 of 17   Issue no.1: Whether the activities of MTPL are in the nature of Portfolio Management Services? 5. As regards the first issue, I note the following from the material available on record such as website, reply of the entity and investor complaints and the documents furnished by the investors:   5.1 From the website minancecapital.com it is noted that the entity provides managed account service (MAS). Following are the features of the said service: i. Managed Accounts: Accounts are held in investors name and managed by its team of traders and researchers. Investor will have full access to their account every time of that day. ii. They are partners with Angel Broking, India's largest broking house. Investor\\\\\\\\u2019s demat and trading account are with Angel Broking. iii. They design and develop quantitative strategies and use them to invest clients\\\\\\\\u2019 money. Quant strategies are math based and take human inefficiencies out of investing. iv. Once account is opened with Angel Broking and Initial Investment is transferred their traders and researchers take it over from there. They will invest while clients relax. 5.2 From the reply dated December 13, 2019 filed by Anurag Bhatia, Director of MTPL the following are noted: (i) MTPL has AMFI registration for mutual fund distribution and was an authorised person from 2016 to 2019. MTPL also has the licence to do Tax filing. (ii) The business of MTPL are as follows: a) Dealing in unlisted stocks b) Tax filing c) Proprietary trading d) Sub broking (no longer existent) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 4 of 17  e) Wealth management and PMS for clients (iii)Since 2017 Portfolio Management services are provided (iv) All solicited money is via bank transfers into the allocated bank accounts (v) Mobilised funds were invested in unlisted equity, equities, Mutual Funds and Derivative strategies. 5.3 From the Investment Partnership Agreement entered between MTPL and the complainant/investor the following are noted: i. The purpose of the agreement is to invest the investment capital of Minance Partner (i.e. investor/the complainant) in Indian equity, equity derivatives and commodity markets. ii. MTPL will invest the investment capital of Minance Partner to the best of its abilities in line with each and every security, financial, investment and taxation related regulations. The Minance partner shall not purchase, sell or deal in any securities on his or her own discretion.  iii. Profits generated on the portfolio will be shared in 80:20 ratio between Minance partner and MTPL respectively.  iv. All losses are capped at 5% of the Minance partner\\\\\\\\u2019s Investment Capital and any losses more than 5% will be borne by MTPL. v. The Minance partner shall inform MTPL five business days prior to the day of redemption in writing and Minance will deduct its 20% performance fee at the time of redemption. Thus, from the above terms of the agreement, it is prima facie observed that clients have entered into discretionary portfolio services at a profit sharing of 80:20 ratio.    5.4 Further, I note the following information gathered from the Bank Account details, transaction documents and KYC documents collected from the Kotak Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank : ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 5 of 17  5.4.1 MTPL is having accounts in Kotak Bank (Account number: 9912354553), ICICI Bank (Account Number: 5305500490) and HDFC Bank (Account Number: 50200026823764)  5.4.2 From the analysis of Bank statements of Kotak Bank account for the period 19/10/2016 to 28/01/2020, it is noted that a total of 1,825 credit transactions were made from different sources into the said account since October 19, 2016 and the total credit received in the aforesaid account is Rs. 56,40,59,782/-.  5.4.3 From the analysis of Bank statements of ICICI Bank account for the period 26/04/2019 to 31/10/2020, it is noted that a total of 226 credit transactions were made from different sources into the said account since April 26, 2019, and the total credit received in the aforesaid account is Rs.4,99,43,498/-. The credits were observed in the ICICI Bank account as recent as October 31, 2020. 5.4.4 From the analysis of Bank Statements of HDFC Bank for the period 01/08/17 to 19/11/20, it is noted that a total of 67 credit transactions were made from different sources into the said account since August 01, 2017 and the total credit received in the aforesaid account is 33,011,913/. The credits were observed in the Bank account as recent as October 15, 2020.  6. Considering the above facts and circumstances especially, the contents of the website, admission of the director of MTPL that they are doing PMS since 2017 and the terms of Investment Partnership Agreement with investors to manage their portfolio coupled with the credit transactions in the Bank Accounts amounting to Rs. 64,70,15,194/- as detailed in preceding paragraphs, it is prima facie inferred that pursuant to a contract with the investors, MTPL on behalf of its clients has undertaken the management of funds as well as securities since 2017 and the fees/funds were collected through the Bank Accounts were for the purpose of availing the Portfolio Management Services. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 6 of 17  7. I have perused the definition of Portfolio Manager as given in regulation 2(cb) of PMS Regulations 1993, which states \\\\\\\\u201cportfolio manager \\\\\\\\u201cmeans any person who pursuant to a contractor arrangement with a client, advises or directs or undertakes on behalf of the client (whether as a discretionary portfolio manager or otherwise) the management or administration of a portfolio of securities or goods or the funds of the client, as the case may be\\\\\\\\u201d.  8. Thus from the discussion in the above paragraphs, there is prima facie evidence that MTPL is acting as portfolio manager and is engaged in \\\\\\\\u2018portfolio management services\\\\\\\\u2019, which falls under the definition of portfolio manager as defined under Regulations 2(cb) of PMS Regulations.  Issue No: 2 If answer to issue no. (i) is in affirmative, whether MTPL has, prima facie, violated the provisions of section 12(1) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 3 of the PMS Regulations?  9. In order to ensure that no investor is defrauded and the PMS activities are extended in conformity with the PMS Regulations,  it is imperative that any person carrying out portfolio management services has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 7 of 17  Similarly, Regulation 3 of PMS Regulations also provides \"No person shall act as portfolio manager unless he holds a certificate granted by the Board under these regulations\".  10. Thus, as per regulation 3 of PMS Regulations and Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, any person acting as portfolio manager and carrying out portfolio management services has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI regulations i.e. the registration of portfolio manager is mandatory.   11. The activities of MTPL as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions shows that MTPL has acted as Portfolio Manager. However, no material was available on record to indicate that MTPL had a certificate of registration as a Portfolio Manager. Therefore, pursuant to a contract between MTPL and its clients, MTPL on behalf of its clients has undertaken the management of funds as well as the securities of its clients since 2017 prima facie indicates that MTPL is acting as unregistered portfolio manager and is engaged in providing unregistered Portfolio Management Services.  12. It is noted that MTPL is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of a portfolio manager. I also note that the directors viz., Soham Soumya Sarkar, Adhiraj Singh and Anurag Bhatia are not registered with SEBI, in their individual capacity as a Portfolio Manager or any other capacity. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by MTPL as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, prima facie, leads to the conclusion that MTPL had provided services of a portfolio manager without a certificate of registration from 2017 till date and has collected an amount of  Rs. 64,70,15,194/- as fee.    13. In my view, these activities are in violation of various provisions of PMS Regulations and such unregistered portfolio managers like MTPL can put investors at great risk by extending services without the regulatory compliance. Thus, the activities MTPL are prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3 of PMS Regulations. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 8 of 17   Issue No.3: If answer to issue No. (ii) is in affirmative, who are all responsible for the violations? 14. From the MCA documents, I find that Anurag Bhatia is  a director of MTPL since inception till present date. I also note that, Soham Soumya Sarkar and Adhiraj Singh who were earlier directors of MTPL have since resigned. The details of the appointment and resignation of the directors are as following: Name of the Directors Date of Appointment Date of Cessation Anurag Bhatia  28/09/2016 Continuing Adhiraj Singh 28/09/2016 21/06/2019 Soham Soumya Sarkar 18/06/2019 13/09/2019  15. I note that any company though a legal entity cannot act by itself, it  can  act only through its Directors. They are expected to exercise their power on behalf of the company with utmost care, skill and diligence.  In terms of Section 179 of the Companies Act, 2013, the Board of Directors of a company shall be entitled to exercise all such  powers  and  do  all  such  acts  and  things  as  the  company  is  authorized  to exercise and do. Therefore, the Board of Directors being responsible for the conduct of the business of a company are liable for any non-compliance of law and such liability shall be upon the individual Directors also. 16. I note for the contravention of law committed by the company, apart from the company, the directors of company who at the time of contravention, were having knowledge of the said contravention or their neglect results in the contravention of law, are also liable for said contravention of law committed by the company.  17. In the instant matter, I find that the core activities / objective of MTPL are to carry on business in securities market as Portfolio Manager. I also find that apart from PMS, the company is not involved in any other business. It is already established in the preceding paragraphs that MTPL is carrying on PMS without obtaining certificate of registration from SEBI. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 9 of 17  18. Thus, the preponderance of the probability indicates that all directors of the company had knowledge and awareness of providing PMS by the company to its clients without obtaining certificate of registration from SEBI. I also note that the liability of the directors also arises if the contravention is attributable to any neglect on the part of them.  There is no material to indicate that the directors have taken any due diligence efforts to prevent the contravention of running un-registered PMS activity by way of making application to SEBI. It shows there is a neglect attributable on the directors.   19. The preponderance of probability indicates that all the directors, regarding the instant contravention, stands on the same footing as they have the knowledge or they have not taken due diligence efforts to apply for registration, i.e., neglected in making the application for registration. Therefore, the extent of liability of each director is same as that of other directors. The extent of the liability vested on one director is not minimized in view of the presence of another director with similar liability. Since every director failed to discharge its liability, their liability is not only joint but also several in the instant case.   Thus, I am of the view that all directors of the company viz., Soham Soumya Sarkar, Adhiraj Singh and Anurag Bhatia are jointly and severally liable for any contravention of law committed by MTPL.  20. It is pertinent to mention that Section 12 (1) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3 of PMS Regulations stipulates that no person shall act as a portfolio manager unless he obtains a certificate of registration from the Board in accordance with the regulations. The SEBI Act along with the PMS Regulations, provide for various remedies in the interest of investor protection. Section 11B of the SEBI Act being one of the pivotal measure for the purpose of investor protection under which remedial tool of refund is envisaged. SEBI Act has also prescribed other set of measures under section 11B of the SEBI Act. The said measures can include direction to refund the amount collected from the investors/clients for its services. While the primary responsibility for refund of amount collected from the investors lies on the Company, it does not absolve the obligation of ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 10 of 17  the directors, who collected the money on behalf of the company by causing the company to indulge in unregistered PMS activities, to refund. Therefore, the directors who collected the money on behalf of the company are also liable under section 11B of the SEBI Act to refund the money collected by them, during their tenure of directorship as mentioned above. Accordingly, the amounts collected are liable to be refunded jointly and severally by the company and by the directors in their personal capacity.  As stated earlier, the liability of the directors is independent and the same can be enforced by way of direction to make refund under Section 11B of SEBI Act.   21. In the instant case, I have already found that MTPL indulged in Portfolio Management Services without obtaining a certificate of registration from SEBI, contravening the provisions of Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 3 of the PMS Regulations. I note that MTPL has collected an amount of Rs. 64,70,15,194/- from investors/clients. From the material available on record and the details of the appointment and resignation of the directors of MTPL reproduced above, it is noted that Soham Soumya Sarkar, Adhiraj Singh and Anurag Bhatia were directors of the Company during the period MTPL was pima facie found to be involved in unregistered portfolio management services, hence I am of the view that they are liable to make refund of the amount collected from the clients/investors during their tenure.  22. I note that Soham Soumya Sarkar and Adhiraj Singh have resigned from the Company. I am of the view that aforesaid directors were also responsible for all the deeds/acts of the Company during the period of their directorship, even though they have since resigned, and they were obligated during their tenure as directors, to ensure that MTPL carries out PMS activity only after obtaining a certificate of registration from SEBI, and thus contravened the provisions of Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 3 of the PMS Regulations. In view of the failure to discharge the said responsibility, the aforesaid directors are also liable for the aforesaid violations. Issue No.4: If answer to issue No. (ii) is in affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any should be issued against them? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 11 of 17  23. As a regulator of capital markets, SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. PMS Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of regulating such activities to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of such activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. PMS Regulations inter alia seek to create a structure within which portfolio managers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their services by requiring portfolio managers to comply with the relevant provisions of the PMS Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market.  24. It is noted from material available on record that as recently as October 31, 2020, money was credited to the Bank accounts of MTPL. This prima facie indicates that the MTPL is still carrying on its unregistered portfolio management services.  Since the conduct of MTPL as mentioned above is not, prima facie, in the interest of investors and the securities market, therefore, urgent necessary action has to be taken against MTPL immediately, else it may lead to loss of investors\\\\\\\\u2019 trust in the securities market. Further, in view of the facts and circumstance of the case, one cannot lose sight of the fact that the violations discussed hereinabove are ongoing which may lead to its engaging with more investors and may continue to raise money from investors in the pretext of providing securities market related services. Furthermore, in case of non-redressal of investor grievances by MTPL, apart from the regulatory protection to investors, the normal remedies available to investors while dealing with a SEBI registered portfolio manager such as invoking the grievance redressal mechanisms, referring the matters to appropriate forum such as arbitration, etc. would not be available to the investors dealing with unregistered portfolio manager. Therefore, the impact of threat of investors getting lured and affected by the unregistered portfolio management services is still looming large and is imminent. Further, the total amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected in the bank account of MTPL is approximately Rs. 64,70,15,194/- which also indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 12 of 17   25. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive a portfolio management service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from an unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the PMS Regulations. An investor receiving a service from unregistered portfolio manager not in consonance with the PMS Regulations vis a vis an investor who receives such service from registered portfolio manager following the PMS Regulations stands in a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged under the PMS regulations. An unregistered portfolio manager has not even satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as portfolio manager. Availing of services from such persons are detrimental to investors and such unqualified services could result in irreparable detriment of the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 interest as money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victim of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury to the development of the securities market also qualifies as \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable detriment\\\\\\\\u201d as the objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market. 26. Further, if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may subscribe by parting with significant fees and handing over control over their funds / securities and this may cause irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is right of the current Noitcee herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the Noitcee. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the \\\\\\\\u201cex-parte orders in the case of private suits\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cex-parte public enforcement actions\\\\\\\\u201d, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential loss to the investors on account of availing portfolio ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 13 of 17  management services from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if prima facie unregistered portfolio management services is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing an exparte-interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favour of the Noitcee.  27. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent MTPL from collecting any more funds from the public and indulging in unauthorized portfolio management activity. Such action needs to be taken not only to prevent any further harm to investors but also to preserve the integrity of the market.    28. As noted earlier, in the present case, prima facie violations of provision of section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3 of the PMS Regulations, have been noticed on the basis of the examination carried out by SEBI. It is pertinent to mention that several complaints involving huge amounts have been filed against MTPL alleging indulging in unregistered PMS and collection of money and the complainants have claimed refund of the money paid by them towards subscription of the services being offered by MTPL pursuant to the contract. One of the directions that can be passed against MTPL, subject to the adjudication of the allegation on the merits in the final order, under Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11B and 11D of SEBI Act is that of direction to refund the money collected by MTPL from their clients.  29. It is noted that entities covered in this order have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by not subjecting themselves to the regulatory requirements of SEBI.  With the initiation of quasi-judicial proceedings, it is imminent that MTPL may divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients. The same may result in defeating the effective implementation of the direction of refund, if any, to be passed after deciding the matter on merits. It therefore becomes necessary for SEBI to take urgent steps to prevent MTPL from diverting the money collected from the subscribers / clients. It is also essential to ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 14 of 17  take urgent steps to prevent them from alienating any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets, so that the final remedies, if any, do not become infructuous. In view of the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove, and considering the interests of already existing clients of MTPL and also the interests of those who may fall prey to the unregistered portfolio management services being carried out by MTPL, the balance of convenience lies against MTPL, which requires immediate action against them including not to divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients.   30. Further, as the bank accounts of MTPL are active, the balance of convenience demands the preventive measure of stopping the collection of money in the bank accounts of MTPL from investors. The same can be effectively achieved by an appropriate direction of stopping the credit into the bank accounts of MTPL.  As MTPL has already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered portfolio manager, the balance of convenience also demands that MTPL is to be prevented from diverting the funds collected from the investors through the unauthorized PMS activity. Accordingly, an appropriate direction stopping debits from the bank accounts of MTPL has been incorporated.   Order:  31. In view of the foregoing, I, pending conclusion of enquiry on grant of hearing opportunity, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11B (1) and 11D read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act hereby issue by way of this interim ex-parte order, the following directions \\\\\\\\u2013  28.1  MTPL and its Directors viz., Soham Soumya Sarkar, Adhiraj Singh and Anurag Bhatia are directed not to access the securities market and buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities or associate themselves with securities market, either directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, until further orders; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of Minance Technologies Private Limited   Page 15 of 17  28.2 MTPL and its Directors viz., Soham Soumya Sarkar, Adhiraj Singh and Anurag Bhatia are directed to cease and desist from undertaking any activity in the securities market including the activity of acting and representing through any media (physical or digital) as a portfolio manager, directly or indirectly, in any matter whatsoever, until further orders; 28.3 If MTPL or its Directors viz., Soham Soumya Sarkar, Adhiraj Singh and Anurag Bhatia have any open position in any exchange traded derivative contracts, as on the date of the order, they can close out/ square off such open positions within 3 months from the date of order or at the expiry of such contracts, whichever is earlier.

The transactions observed in the abovementioned bank accounts are summarized as under:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Always Gain Advisory Service                                                              Page 6 of 16  Transaction Period  Bank Name and account number No. of transactions Amount Collected in Rs.

From the analysis of Bank statements, the following is observed: 5.6.1. The bank accounts are active. 5.6.2. The total credit received in the aforesaid accounts is approximately Rs. 1.09 crore during the period September 8, 2014 to November 23, 2020. 5.6.3. It is observed that there are 1,468 credit transactions received in the said bank accounts. From the narrative of the transactions, it appears that the payments have, prima facie, come from various investors / clients. An illustrative list of narrations in the ICICI Bank account of the firm is as under: Transaction Date Narration Credit (Rs.) 6-10-2018 NEFT-N279180649225129- PRAKASH T J-Multi bagger fut 12000 26-10-2018 MMT/IMPS/829914820803/MB: NIFTY FUTUR/MANU V /K 2000 8-11-2018 NEFT-N312180675875171- PRAKASH T J-Nifty future-001 8000 12-11-2018 Mmt/imps/831410109322/Option intraday/RAJESH L /H 2100  6. In light of the aforesaid discussions, I prima facie observe, based on the contents of firm\\\\\\\\u2019s websites wherein various services offered by the firm has been described, that Always Gain Advisory Service is prima facie, holding itself out as an investment adviser. Further, it is also prima facie, observed from the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s webpages that it offers various tips / services to its clients in the securities market through SMSs, G-talk and phone including live support and follow ups. Considering the above facts and circumstances, especially the content of the websites of the firm coupled with the credit transactions in the bank accounts, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees / funds credited to the bank accounts, were for the purpose of availing the services indicated on the websites of Always Gain Advisory Service.  7. In this factual context, I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Always Gain Advisory Service                                                              Page 7 of 16  person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d  8. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is observed from the contents of the websites of the firm that the firm is prima facie, holding itself out as investment adviser by offering to provide investment advice as defined under regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations by offering to give advice related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription. Further, as noted from the bank accounts that there are multiple credit entries which when seen together with the contents of the websites leads to the prima facie conclusion that the credit entries in the bank accounts are consideration for the investment advice given by the firm to its clients. Thus, prima facie, the firm is an investment adviser as defined under regulation 2 (m) of IA Regulations.  9. The fact that the firm, in its account opening form with ICICI Bank Ltd. and the details submitted to the payment gateway, has mentioned that its business activity is providing advisory service in securities market coupled with the various subscription packages offered by the firm in various segments of the market viz, equity, derivatives and commodity, when seen in light of the receipt of money in its bank accounts, prima facie shows, on preponderance of probability basis, that the credit of money is in fact the fee for the investment advisory services rendered by the firm. Therefore, the firm has not only held itself out as investment adviser but has also acted as an investment adviser for consideration.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Always Gain Advisory Service                                                              Page 8 of 16  Issue No. 2: If answer to aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether Always Gain Advisory Service has, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act read with IA Regulations? 10. In order to ensure that investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of SEBI Act reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d Further, as per regulation 3(1) of IA Regulations, the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.  11. The activities of the firm, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that Always Gain Advisory Service was holding itself out as an investment adviser and also has been acting as an investment adviser. However, no material is available on record to indicate that Always Gain Advisory Service or its partners, Mr. M Ashok Kumar, Mr. S Ramakrishnan and Mr. G Manohari in their individual capacity have a certificate of registration as investment adviser. In this context, it is noted that Always Gain Advisory Service and its partners, Mr. M Ashok Kumar, Mr. S Ramakrishnan and Mr. G Manohari in their individual capacity are not registered with SEBI in any capacity. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by Always Gain Advisory Service, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, leads to the conclusion that Always Gain Advisory Service__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Always Gain Advisory Service                                                              Page 9 of 16  is holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser without a certificate of registration from SEBI. In my view, these activities/ representations of Always Gain Advisory Service are, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.  Issue No. 3: If answers to issue nos. (1) & (2) are affirmative, who are responsible for the violations? 12. I note from the available records that following are the partners of the firm: Sl. No. Name of the Partner Tenure 1 Mr. M Ashok Kumar 24-7-2014 till date 2 Mr. S Ramakrishnan 24-7-2014 to 14-4-2019 3 Mr. G Manohari 9-4-2019 till date  13. As per Section 25 of The Partnership Act, 1932, \\\\\\\\u201cevery partner is liable jointly with all the other partners and also severally, for all acts of the firm done while he is a partner\\\\\\\\u201d. It has been noted in preceding paragraphs that the websites of the firm are active and the last credit transaction in its bank account is in the month of November, 2020. The same prima facie, shows that the firm is carrying out its unregistered investment advisory activity. Thus, for the prima facie, unregistered investment adviser activities, all the aforesaid partners of Always Gain Advisory Service, are prima facie, jointly and severally liable during their respective terms as partners. Issue No. 4: If answer to issue no. 2 is in affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any, should be issued against those responsible for the prima facie, violations?  14. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. IA Regulations has been formulated with the main objective of regulating investment advisory activities to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of investment advisory activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations, inter alia, seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Always Gain Advisory Service                                                              Page 10 of 16  advisers to comply with the criteria set out in the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market. 15. In the instant case, Always Gain Advisory Service is soliciting and inducing investors to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips, intra-day calls etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration / certification as mandated under the IA Regulations. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Always Gain Advisory Service through its partners, from collecting any more fees from the public and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. It is noted from material available on record that the last transaction in the bank account of Always Gain Advisory Service is in the month of November, 2020 (ICICI Bank). Moreover, the websites of the firm are active as on date. Furthermore, the details of the firm including its email and telephone number are mentioned on its websites. The firm, vide its email dated July 8, 2019 has inter-alia, submitted that it has stopped the investment advisory activity and attached a screen shot in relation to the closure of the Always Gain Advisory Service website. However, as noted, the websites of the firm are still active. Thus, the websites of the firm had only closed temporarily. This act of the firm, prima facie, shows that the partners of the firm are determined in continuing the unregistered investment advisory activities. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Always Gain Advisory Service in the securities market is still in existence and imminent. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Always Gain Advisory Service is Rs. 1,09,27,292/- and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.  16. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from the unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from registered investment advisor in consonance with the IA Regulations vis-a-vis an investor who receives such service from unregistered investment adviser stands__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Always Gain Advisory Service                                                              Page 11 of 16  at a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged under the IA regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment adviser.  Availing of service from such persons is detrimental to investors and such unqualified service results in irreparable detriment as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victim of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury/detriment to the development of the securities market also qualifies as an \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d. The objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market. 17. Further if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may have to part away with large fees and investment resulting into irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is right of the current entity herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the ex-parte orders in the case of private suits and ex-parte public enforcement actions, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential deployment of funds by the investors by following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if, prima facie, unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing an ex-parte interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favour of the entity.   18. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Always Gain Advisory Service from collecting any__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Always Gain Advisory Service                                                              Page 12 of 16  more funds from the public and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. As noted in the preceding paragraphs, monies were being credited in the bank account of the firm as on November, 2020 and its bank accounts are still active. Moreover, the websites of the firm are active. The same prima facie demonstrates that Always Gain Advisory Service can still lure investors to deal through it in the securities market and probability of investors reaching Always Gain Advisory Service is still high. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Always Gain Advisory Service in the securities market is still in existence and imminent.  19. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Always Gain Advisory Service is approximately Rs. 1.09 crore and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors. In light of the same, I find that there is no other alternative but to take recourse through an interim ex-parte order against Always Gain Advisory Service and its partners for preventing them from collecting funds by indulging in unauthorized investment advisory services without obtaining the mandatory registrations from SEBI in accordance with the law. As the websites of the firm are active which prima facie, shows that the investors can reach it and also its bank accounts are active, the balance of convenience demands the preventive measure of stopping the collection of money in the bank accounts of the firm from investors. The same can be effectively achieved by an appropriate direction of stopping credit into the bank account of the firm. As Always Gain Advisory Service and its partners have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, the balance of convenience also demands that Always Gain Advisory Service and its partners have to be prevented from diverting the funds collected from the investors through unauthorized investment advisory activity. Accordingly, an appropriate direction stopping the debit from the bank account of the firm and its partners have been incorporated been incorporated.  20. With the initiation of quasi-judicial proceedings, Always Gain Advisory Service and its partners have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI without getting the certificate of registration as IA, it is imminent that the firm and its partners may divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients. The same may result in defeating the effective__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Always Gain Advisory Service                                                              Page 13 of 16  implementation of the direction of refund, if any, to be passed after deciding the matter on merits. It therefore becomes necessary for SEBI to take urgent steps to prevent the firm and its partners from diverting the money collected from the subscribers / clients. It is also essential to take urgent steps to prevent them from alienating any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets, so that the final remedies, if any, do not become infructuous. In view of the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove, and considering the interests of already existing clients of the firm and its partners and also the interests of those who may fall prey to the unregistered investment advisory by reaching the firm through email or telephone, the balance of convenience lies against the firm and its partners, which requires immediate action against them including not to divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients / investors.   ORDER  21. In view of the above, pending conclusion of enquiry on granting of hearing opportunity as per this Order, to Always Gain Advisory Service and its partners (current and past), Mr. M Ashok Kumar, Mr. S Ramakrishnan and Mr. G Manohari, I, in order to protect the interests of investors and integrity of the securities market, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Sections 11, 11(4), 11B (1) and 11D read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act hereby issue by way of this interim ex-parte order, the following directions:  21.1.

It is further observed from an internet search of the particulars of hosting of the website of the firm, www.hybridresearch.in, based on its domain name that prima facie, the said website was hosted for the first time on May 16, 2019. From the complaint it is observed that the firm has bank accounts maintained with ICICI Bank__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Hybrid Research Advisory Services                                                       Page 6 of 19  and Bank of India. Further, payments can be made to the firm through payment gateway, PayUMoney which is linked with the bank account maintained with Bank of India. The aforesaid bank accounts are in the name of the sole proprietor of the firm, Mr. Nikhil Kumar. The transactions observed in the abovementioned bank accounts are summarized as under: Account Number & Bank Period of Bank Statement  Date of last credit Total Credits (Rs.) 004101575125 - ICICI Bank 16/5/2019 to 11/3/2020 9/3/2020 94,42,326 691310110001145 - Bank of India 16/5/2019 to 11/8/2020 5/8/2020 2,90,77,116                                           Total 3,85,19,442  5.5. From the analysis of Bank statements, the following is observed: 5.5.1. The bank accounts are active. 5.5.2. The total credit received in the aforesaid accounts is approximately Rs. 3.85 crore during the period May 16, 2019 to August 11, 2020. 5.5.3. It is observed that there are numerous credit transactions / large number of payments received in the said bank accounts. From the narrative of the transactions, it appears that the payments have, prima facie, come from various investors / clients.  6. In light of the aforesaid discussions, I prima facie observe, from the contents of firm\\\\\\\\u2019s website(s) wherein various services offered by the firm has been described, that Hybrid Research Advisory Services is prima facie, holding itself out as an investment adviser. Further, it is also prima facie, observed from the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s webpages that it claims to be registered with SEBI as investment advisory firm. Moreover, it is noted that it offered various tips / services to its clients in the securities market through SMSs, social media platforms and phone including follow up messages on every call. Considering the above facts and circumstances, especially the content of the website(s) of the firm coupled with the credit transactions in the bank accounts, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees / funds credited to the bank accounts, were for the purpose of availing the services indicated on the website(s) of Hybrid Research Advisory Services.  7. In this factual context, I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Hybrid Research Advisory Services                                                       Page 7 of 19  person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d  8. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is observed from the contents of the website(s) of the firm that the firm is prima facie, holding itself out as investment adviser by offering to provide investment advice as defined under regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations by offering to give advice related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription. Further, as noted from the bank accounts that there are multiple credit entries which when seen together with the contents of the website(s) leads to the prima facie conclusion that the credit entries in the bank accounts are consideration for the investment advice given by the firm to its clients. Thus, prima facie, the firm is an investment adviser as defined under regulation 2 (m) of IA Regulations.  9. The fact that the firm, is claiming to be registered with SEBI to provide investment advisory services and offers various subscription packages in various segments of the market viz, equity, derivatives and commodity, when seen in light of the receipt of money in its bank accounts, prima facie shows, on preponderance of probability basis, that the credit of money is in fact the fee for the investment advisory services rendered by the firm. Therefore, the firm has not only held itself out as investment adviser but has also acted as an investment adviser for consideration.  Issue No. 2: If answer to aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether Hybrid Research Advisory Services has, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act read with IA Regulations and provisions of PFUTP Regulations? 10. In order to ensure that investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Hybrid Research Advisory Services                                                       Page 8 of 19  obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of SEBI Act reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d Further, as per regulation 3(1) of IA Regulations, the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.  11. The activities of the firm, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that Hybrid Research Advisory Services was holding itself out as an investment adviser and also has been acting as an investment adviser. However, no material is available on record to indicate that Hybrid Research Advisory Services or its proprietor, Mr. Nikhil Kumar in his individual capacity has a certificate of registration as investment adviser. In this context, it is noted that Hybrid Research Advisory Services and Mr. Nikhil Kumar in his individual capacity are not registered with SEBI in any capacity. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by Hybrid Research Advisory Services, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, leads to the conclusion that Hybrid Research Advisory Services is holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser without a certificate of registration from SEBI. In my view, these activities/ representations of Hybrid Research Advisory Services are, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.  12. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b), (c) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Hybrid Research Advisory Services                                                       Page 9 of 19  Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). The text of the aforesaid provisions is reproduced below:  SEBI Act Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control Section 12A: No person shall directly or indirectly:  (a)  use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  (b)  employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange; (c) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; PFUTP Regulations Regulation 3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities No person shall directly or indirectly- (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under; (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Hybrid Research Advisory Services                                                       Page 10 of 19  which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under. 4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a manipulative, fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities market. (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a manipulative fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves any of the following: - \\\\\\\\u2026 (k) disseminating information or advice through any media, whether physical or digital, which the disseminator knows to be false or misleading and which is designed or likely to influence the decision of investors dealing in securities\\\\\\\\u201d. 13. In my view, an unregistered investment advisor like Hybrid Research Advisory Services can put investors at great risk by misleading them. Without having a registered investment advisor certificate, Hybrid Research Advisory Services is holding itself out as an investment advisor and offers services through its website to investors with the objective of making money / collecting fees through subscriptions.  14. Moreover, from the website(s) of the firm it is noted that it claims to be registered with SEBI as an investment advisory firm which follows all the norms made by SEBI for investor protection. Thus, prima facie, it appears that Hybrid Research Advisory Services is knowingly concealing the fact that it is not registered with SEBI as an investment advisor and is also making representations knowing that it is false, thereby luring and inducing investors to deal in securities by availing its services.  15. Furthermore, the firm has claimed the following: 15.1.  \\\\\\\\u201cWe are SEBI registered tips provider and provides you tips that will surely provide you a profit with proper target. 15.2. Under the subscription package, Stock Cash Premium, the firm has claimed that \\\\\\\\u201cwe expect to get return of up to 2% to 3% of invested amount on every call.\\\\\\\\u201d  Thus, by making the aforesaid claims, Hybrid Research Advisory Services is inducing investors to deal in securities by availing its services. Such modus operandi is being__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Hybrid Research Advisory Services                                                       Page 11 of 19  continuously used by Hybrid Research Advisory Services which is evident from the fact that there are continuous credits in its bank accounts.  16. It is observed that the firm has claimed to provide a specific return on client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment or to claim to make a sure profit, is prima facie, an active concealment of the material fact that every investment in the market is subject to market risk. Considering the dynamics of the market, the returns from the investment in the market are unpredictable, no matter how much and for how long the investment is made. Any information that the firm puts out for the consumption of its existing and prospective clients has to be done with great responsibility and should be of such nature that it enables investors to take reasoned and unbiased decisions regarding their investment. This act of conveying specific returns or certainty of profit, is prima facie, indulged for the purpose of luring customers in its net and thereby increasing its income. In light of the same, the act of the firm to actively conceal material information, is a non-genuine and a deceptive act and has been prima facie made with an intent to influence the client to avail its advisory services.   17. The above discussed omission and act of Hybrid Research Advisory Services are prima facie, fraudulent and are covered under the definition of 'fraud' defined under regulation 2(1)(c) of PFUTP Regulations which reads as under: \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d includes any act, expression, omission or concealment committed whether in a deceitful manner or not by a person or by any other person with his connivance or by his agent while dealing in securities in order to induce another person or his agent to deal in securities, whether or not there is any wrongful gain or avoidance of any loss, and shall also include-- (1) a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of material fact in order that another person may act to his detriment; (2) a suggestion as to a fact which is not true by one who does not believe it to be true; (3) an active concealment of a fact by a person having knowledge or belief of the fact; (4) a promise made without any intention of performing it; (5) a representation made in a reckless and careless manner whether it be true or false; (6) any such act or omission as any other law specifically declares to be fraudulent; (7) deceptive behavior by a person depriving another of informed consent or full participation; (8) a false statement made without reasonable ground for believing it to be true;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Hybrid Research Advisory Services                                                       Page 12 of 19  (9) the act of an issuer of securities giving out misinformation that affects the market price of the security, resulting in investors being effectively misled even though they did not rely on the statement itself or anything derived from it other than the market price.   And \\\\\\\\u201cfraudulent\\\\\\\\u201d shall be construed accordingly;  18. It is noted that prima facie fraudulent activities / conduct / act / practice of Hybrid Research Advisory Services as discussed above are prima facie in violation of in violation of provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b), (c) of SEBI Act and regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of PFUTP Regulations.  Issue No. 3: If answers to issue nos. (1) & (2) are affirmative, who are responsible for the violations? 19. I note that Mr. Nikhil Kumar is the sole proprietor of Hybrid Research Advisory Services. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in Ashok Transport Agency vs. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business. . A suit by or against a proprietary concern is by or against the proprietor of the business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Mr. Nikhil Kumar is liable for the acts of Hybrid Research Advisory Services.  Issue No. 4: If answer to issue no. 2 is in affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any, should be issued against those responsible for the prima facie, violations?  20. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The PFUTP Regulations and the IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of preventing fraudulent activities and regulating investment advisory activities to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of investment advisory activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations, inter alia, seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the criteria set out in the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Hybrid Research Advisory Services                                                       Page 13 of 19  integrity of the securities market. Similarly, the PFUTP Regulations seeks to curb fraudulent and manipulative activities in the securities market in order to boost investor confidence in the securities market and to provide an environment conductive to increased participation and investment in the securities market which is vital to the growth and development of the economy. 21. In the instant case, Hybrid Research Advisory Services is soliciting and inducing investors to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips, intra-day calls etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration / certification as mandated under the IA Regulations. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Hybrid Research Advisory Services through its proprietor, from collecting any more fees from the public and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. It is noted from material available on record that the last transaction in the bank account of Hybrid Research Advisory Services is as August 5, 2020 (Bank of India). Moreover, the website of the firm, www.hybridresearch.co.in, is still active as on October 30, 2020. Furthermore, the details of the firm including its location, email (enquiry can be sent to the firm by an email) and telephone number are mentioned on its aforementioned website. Also, the very act of the firm to change its URL / website address, multiple times, prima facie, shows that the firm is trying to avoid regulatory detection and is determined in continuing its unregistered investment advisory activities. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Hybrid Research Advisory Services in the securities market is still in existence and imminent. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Hybrid Research Advisory Services is Rs. 3,85,19,442/- and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.  22. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from the unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from registered investment advisor in consonance with the IA Regulations vis-__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Hybrid Research Advisory Services                                                       Page 14 of 19  a-vis an investor who receives such service from unregistered investment adviser stands at a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged under the IA regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment adviser.

(hereinafter interchangeably referred to as \\\\\\\\u201c3M/ IA/ Noticee\\\\\\\\u201d) is registered as an Investment Adviser (\\\\\\\\u201cIA\\\\\\\\u201d) under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) with effect from September 09, 2014. The name of the company was changed to 3M Team Research Private Limited with effect from December 30, 2016. The present Directors of the company are Mr. Rakesh Sethi and Mr. Pramod Jain. The company has its registered office at 325, Milinda Manor, RNT__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 2 of 22  Marg, Opposite Central Mall, Indore - 452001. Its website address is http://www.3mteam.in.   2. Mr. Vikas Jain (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201ccomplainant\\\\\\\\u201d) filed a complaint with SEBI against the Noticee and submitted documents in support of his allegations. The following allegations have been made by the complainant:  2.1. Mr. Rakesh Sethi, director of the Noticee, insisted on opening a Demat and Trading Account for him in Arihant Capital Markets Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cArihant\\\\\\\\u201d).   2.2. The complainant was provided with details of the \\\\\\\\u2018Wealth Creator BTST Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019 by the Noticee and he paid Rs. 20,000/- to the Noticee in the name of providing Portfolio Management Service (PMS).   2.3. Mr. Rakesh Sethi represents himself as a SEBI Registered Portfolio Manager and a registered Sub-Broker of Arihant. The complainant submitted the webpages from the website of the Noticee depicting the salient feature of the PMS Advisory Service and job openings for PMS Executives offered by it.  3. Based on the above mentioned details, a preliminary examination into the affairs of the Noticee was carried out. Based on the findings of this preliminary examination, vide interim order dated November 26, 2019, the following, prima facie, observations were made against the Noticee and its Directors, Mr. Rakesh Sethi and Mr. Pramod Jain:  3.1. The Noticee has (a) held itself out as a portfolio manager, (b) provided the portfolio management service to its client(s) and (c) charged service fee from client(s) for the same without obtaining the necessary certificate of registration. 3.2. The Noticee was found to be offering assured returns by making representation to that effect on its website.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 3 of 22  3.3. The complaint of Mr. Vikas Jain was referred for arbitration at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) against Arihant and its Authorized Person (AP), Mr. Rakesh Sethi. From the findings in the arbitration awards and on the basis of the material available on record, it was held that Mr. Rakesh Sethi, in his capacity as director of the Noticee, has misused the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s website for his own personal gain as an AP in order to induce the complainant and the same amounts to a scheme or artifice to defraud investors like the complainant.   4. Based on the above observations, the Noticee and its Directors, Mr. Rakesh Sethi and Mr. Pramod Jain, were, prima facie, held to be in violation of the following provisions of securities laws:   4.1. The Noticee was held to be in violation of Section 12(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992, read with Regulation 3 of the SEBI (Portfolio Managers) Regulations, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPMS Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). 4.2. The Noticee was held to be in violation of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992, and Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and 4(1) and 4(2) (k) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). 4.3. The Noticee was held to be in violation of Clauses 1 and 8 of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 15 (9) of the IA Regulations.  5. Mr. Rakesh Sethi, Director of the Noticee, was found to be, prima facie, in contravention of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992, and Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and 4(1) of the PFUTP Regulations.  6. In view of the above observations, the following directions were issued against the Noticee and its present Directors, Mr. Rakesh Sethi and Mr. Pramod Jain:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 4 of 22  6.1. The Noticee and its present directors, and any person while working under it/ them or under its/ their instructions as employee or otherwise, shall cease and desist from undertaking the activity of investment advisory services, including the activity of acting and representing through any media (physical or digital) as an investment advisor, directly or indirectly, till further orders.  6.2. The Noticee, as ensured by the present directors, shall remove all references made by it through any media (physical or digital) regarding (i) holding itself out as a portfolio manager and (ii) expected returns from services/ products offered by it.  6.3. Mr. Rakesh Sethi, director of the Noticee, is restrained from buying, selling or dealing in the securities market or associating himself with the securities market, either directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, till further directions.  6.4. The Noticee shall display the contents of this Order on its website and other social media platforms immediately.  7. Replies of the Noticee and both its Directors were received vide their letters dated December 16, 2019. An opportunity of hearing was also sought and the same was granted on July 15, 2020. The personal hearing was conducted via video-conferencing in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and the same was attended by the Authorized Representative for the Noticee and its Directors. Time was granted till July 30, 2020, to make additional submissions and the same have been received vide July 29, 2020. The submissions of the Noticee and both its Directors post the interim order and post the personal hearing are similar in nature and are mentioned below:  7.1. Complaint of Mr. Vikas Jain:   7.1.1. Apart from the said complainant, no complaints have been made by any of our clients to SEBI which indicates that we have always acted in a__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 5 of 22  righteous manner and not deceived any of our clients. This fact ought to be taken into consideration. 7.1.2. The complainant approached us to enquire about short and long term delivery based investment stocks. We addressed the query and provided information and advice. The complainant was satisfied and we merely suggested the name of Arihant for handling broking on behalf of the complainant and we deny that we insisted that broking account should only be opened with Arihant. As complainant was desirous of opening trading account with Arihant, we forwarded demat and trading account opening forms. 7.1.3. It cannot be concluded that we insisted on opening account with Arihant. It can be alleged that we facilitated account opening process. The complainant could have always opened account with another intermediary. If we had insisted, then complainant could have challenged the alleged \\\\\\\\u201cinsisting\\\\\\\\u201d. Hence, the same is an afterthought and the observations are erroneous and need to be disregarded. 7.1.4. We deny that we received Rs. 20000/- in the name of PMS or offered assured returns to the tune of 200-400% p.a. Email dated 04.04.2014 clearly states that we shall provide advisory services and we have not represented ourselves as a portfolio manager in the email or the enclosed scheme. It is evident that the complainant has misrepresented the facts. 7.1.5. Even though the invoice bears the words \\\\\\\\u201cPMS\\\\\\\\u201d, it cannot be construed to mean that we have provided PMS. It is apparent that we have only provided advisory services. 7.1.6. The complainant could have verified that Regulation 15(1A) of the PMS Regulations requires any portfolio manager not to accept from clients, funds or securities worth less than Rs. 25 lacs/- and hence, the allegation and conclusion of the Ld. WTM falls flat as we had offered investment advisory services and taken Rs. 20000/-.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 6 of 22  7.1.7. Further, there is no copy of the agreement which is pre-requisite as per Regulation 14(1a) of the PMS Regulations. 7.1.8. The complaints at NSE filed by the complainant have been settled since we have already paid the appellate award claim. It was orally agreed by the complainant that he shall withdraw all complaints against us from all forums as the dispute had been resolved. The conduct of the complainant reflects that he has never approached any forum with clean hands and never had any inclination to resolve the dispute. It is humbly submitted that the cause of action against us stood vitiated on the issue of the appellate award and the present proceedings against us for the same cause of action amount to double jeopardy.  7.2. Unregistered Portfolio Management:  7.2.1. We vehemently deny that we are holding out as a portfolio manager. We reiterate that on the website it is clearly mentioned that we offer PMS Advisory Services which makes it apparent that we merely provided advisory services towards long term investments to our clients and not manage the portfolio, as is wrongly alleged. It was strictly an advisory service and cannot be interpreted to mean that we are offering services of a portfolio manager. The term has attained a wrong nomenclature. 7.2.2. Under this section we have provided general information as to what comprises PMS and it should not be construed as providing PMS since we have never admitted that we provided PMS. 7.2.3. PMS and advisory services related to PMS are distinct and separate services and our services could never be deemed to be portfolio management. Assuming that we were offering PMS, Regulation 15(1A) and 14(1a) of the PMS Regulations could never be applied to us since we had not fulfilled any condition to be recognized under PMS. As per Regulation 15(1A), a portfolio manager cannot accept funds/ securities__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 7 of 22  worth less than Rs. 25 lacs from a client. We have only taken Rs. 20000/- from the complainant, which if for providing advisory services. 7.2.4. Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations defines \\\\\\\\u201cinvestment advice\\\\\\\\u201d which amongst others includes advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products i.e., it was advisory services for creating a portfolio. Apart from that we were also advising client with respect to reshuffle, rearrange, and reconstruct investment which is within the scope of the definition of investment advice. 7.2.5. We have taken measures to eliminate misrepresentation, if any, by redesigned our website and the impugned order has rightly concluded that as of date our website does not have such offering. 7.2.6. As regards advertisement on naukri.com, we state that the same was for executives who shall assist in providing advisory services and it cannot be construed to connote that we were offering PMS.  7.2.7. Regarding the invoice of Rs. 20000/- from our Account Department, the term \\\\\\\\u201cPMS\\\\\\\\u201d is short for PMS Advisory Services provided to the complainant. One of the employed sales personnel had unwittingly sent an email without permission of the Administration Department and we most humbly pray that the ignorant conduct of one such person may not be held as the general reflection on our conduct. The term used may be given liberal interpretation in lieu of the fact that we are IAs and do not provide any portfolio management services and there has been no complaint from any of our other clients apart from the complainant. 7.2.8. The complainant has paid Rs. 2 lacs to Arihant and it is a misconception that we were in receipt of Rs. 2 lacs from the complainant. 7.2.9. We deny that we have held ourselves as a Portfolio Manager or provided any PMS services to our clients or charged fee for PMS from our clients. We have only charged fees towards advisory services. We deny having Section 12 (1) of the SEBI Act read with Regulation 3 of the PMS__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 8 of 22  Regulations as we were not required to hold a certificate of registration for portfolio management.  7.3. Offering assured returns:   7.3.1. With respect to \\\\\\\\u201cWealth Creator Stock Future/BTST/STBT Scheme\\\\\\\\u201d, perusal of scheme document shows that we are providing advisory services and moreover, the returns set out are probable returns derived as per the available financial tools and comparative estimate and that there was no promise of the assured returns, as alleged. Further, the complainant was never a party to the scheme and has no locus standi to complain. 7.3.2. The returns mentioned as part of PMS Advisory Services are expected returns and were never meant to be assured returns and are merely projected estimated returns as per available financial tools.  7.3.3. With respect to our advertising of a service/ product named \\\\\\\\u2018Modi 2019 to 2024 (Multibagger calls)\\\\\\\\u2019 on our website where one of the feature of this service/ product is an expected return of 100-200 percent, the contents are based on mere assumptions and on this ground alone, the allegations are liable to be disregarded. We never made any promises to any of our clients for any assured returns. 7.3.4. We always advise clients not to trade in intraday and also discourage frequent trading in market. Based on experience of Mr. Rakesh Sethi, we recommend power of investment by Rule of 72 and power of compounding effect. Rule of 72 is a simple way to determine how long an investment will take to double given a fixed annual rate of interest and is reasonably accurate for low rates of return.  7.3.5. The BTST/STBT scheme was recommended to clients who were looking for quick returns on a daily basis/ having horizon of 2 days. Strategy was based on assumption that recommendations will result in profit on around__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 9 of 22  15-16 days out of 20 trading days in a month and on remaining 4-5 days, trades may result in loss/stop loss trigger. Accordingly, trades in this scheme will result in an overall profit. However, we have disclosed to all clients that the above expected returns are based on our trading experience of over 20 years and are subject to market risks. The Wealth Creator scheme has a holding period of 10 to 30 years. 7.3.6. We merely render investment advice to the clients and have never provided any schemes of unrealistic/ assured returns. The scheme document has been misinterpreted and the estimates are based on financial tools available and we have not made any promises of such returns. Therefore, we have not made any reckless and careless representation. We deny that we have made any false statements without reasonable ground for believing it to be true and have never intended to sell products/ services with expected returns. We deny that we have indulged in any manipulative or deceptive practice or employed any scheme to defraud any person.  7.3.7. None of the general obligations and responsibilities, as defined in Regulation 15(1) of the IA Regulations, have been breached. Neither does Regulation 15(1) nor the Code of Conduct deal with returns and any reference to these is out context. We deny that have violated Regulation 15(9) read with the Code of Conduct for IAs. We have always followed the Code of Conduct. 7.3.8. We deny we have made any false statements without reasonable ground for believing it to be true and have never intended to sell services/ products with expected returns to investors. We have merely provided investment advice. 7.3.9. We have neither indulged in any manipulative nor deceptive practice or employed scheme to defraud nor engaged in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud upon any person. We__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 10 of 22  have not disseminated any false or misleading information or advice likely to influence the decision of investors dealing in securities.  7.3.10. Our Director, Mr. Rakesh Sethi, has been associated with the stock market for the last 30 years and has a background in the banking industry as well. 7.3.11. We are not only advising but also educating people in areas of investment in the stock market. 7.3.12. We deny that we have violated provisions of Sections 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act and provisions of the PFUTP Regulations.   7.4. Additional submissions of Mr. Rakesh Sethi, Director of Noticee:  7.4.1. I deny that I have given any sort of confirmation to the complainant pertaining to assured returns. 7.4.2. I further state that the allegation of the complainant that I started trading in his account and handled his portfolio which resulted in losses is completely erroneous and misleading. All trades of the complainant were executed through Arihant.  7.4.3. I deny that the investment decisions in the complainants account were taken by me and I was only associated for providing investment advice. I have no involvement in the trading done on behalf of the complainant and no conclusion can be drawn against me. 7.4.4. I deny the findings of the arbitration award.  7.4.5. I deny that in the absence of any appeal against the arbitration award, the findings are deemed to be accepted by me. It is a matter of fact and record that the matter was settled between the complainant and the company and therefore the present proceedings clear tantamount to double jeopardy as allegations are based on the same grounds as already been settled.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 11 of 22  7.4.6. It is pertinent to note that merely by not appealing against the appellate arbitral award can never be concluded as admission of liability since it was a business call so as to avoid stress in the legal recourse, legal fees, court fees and incidental fees attached thereto. 7.4.7. I deny that in my capacity as a Director of the company, I have used the contents of the website stating assured returns to lure the complainant to open trading and demat account. The complainant has failed to place credible evidence in his complaint to SEBI that the company or I had insisted that he should open account with Arihant. 7.4.8. I deny that I had control over the funds in the trading account of the complainant. The allegation is a bald statement without any proof of my control over the funds. The complainant has miserably failed to prove the same. It does not stand to reason to conclude that I was in control of the funds because neither I nor the company was POA holders to the bank account of the complainant.  7.4.9. The allegation that all decisions were taken by me for my personal gain remain unsubstantiated. At the most, what could be alleged is that the company received Rs. 20000/- towards advisory fees and nothing beyond that. The allegation is open to scrutiny since there are no documents on record to conclude that I have made personal gains. In the absence of credible evidence, the conclusion arrived at in the order lacks merit. I deny that I had induced the complainant or any person in any manner whatsoever or had devised any scheme to defraud investors using the company\\\\\\\\u2019s website.  7.4.10. I deny that I have indulged in manipulative or deceptive practice or employed scheme to defraud any person. I deny that I have violated Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3 and 4 of the PFUTP Regulations.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 12 of 22   8. Pursuant to personal hearing, the Mr. Rakesh Sethi, Director, has made the following additional submissions:   8.1. The complainant had provided an authority letter for trading in favour of Mr. Rakesh Sethi. The said letter, signed and filed with the broker, authorized Mr. Rakesh Sethi to accept and execute securities dealing orders on behalf of the complainant.  8.2. The complainant has never denied receipt of all SMS and Electronic Contract Notes as well as periodical statements from the broker.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES:  9. I have considered the material on record/ replies/ oral submissions/ written submissions filed by the Noticee and its Directors. The issue to be considered at this stage is as follows:  9.1. Whether in light of the facts and circumstances of the case, the findings of the interim order and the submissions of the Noticee and its Directors in response thereto, the directions issued against the Noticee and its Directors vide the interim order need to be confirmed, revoked or modified in any manner?  9.2. Whether in light of the facts and circumstances of the case, the findings of the interim order and the submissions of the Noticee and its Directors in response thereto, the prayers of the Noticee and its Directors need to be granted or denied?   10. The consideration of the issues in light of the material on record/ replies/ oral submissions/ written submissions made by the Noticee and its Directors is contained in subsequent paragraphs.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 13 of 22  Unregistered Portfolio Management:  11. It was observed in the interim order that the Noticee, prima facie, as part of its services, is holding itself out as a portfolio manager by claiming to offer PMS Advisory Services. It was also held that, prima facie, the Noticee has provided PMS to its client(s) and has charged service fee from client(s) for the same. The evidence that was available in this regard is the contents of the website of the Noticee, where the service/ product \\\\\\\\u201cPMS Advisory Services\\\\\\\\u201d was mentioned, advertisement given by the Noticee for recruitment of PMS Executives and the invoice and email sent by the Noticee to the complainant saying PMS.  12. The Noticee has submitted that \\\\\\\\u201cPMS Advisory Services\\\\\\\\u201d is strictly an investment advisory service and they merely provided advisory services towards long term investments of their clients and did not manage their portfolio. The Noticee has further submitted that PMS Advisory Service falls within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cinvestment advice\\\\\\\\u201d as per Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations. The Noticee has accepted that the term \\\\\\\\u201cPMS Advisory Services\\\\\\\\u201d has attained a wrong nomenclature and that it has made changes to its website to eliminate any misrepresentation. With respect to the job advertisement placed by the Noticee on its website, it has been submitted that the advertisement was for executives who shall assist in providing advisory services. As regards the mentioning of PMS on the invoice given to the complainant, the Noticee has submitted that PMS was a short form for PMS Advisory Services. Further, the email sent by the Accounts Department of the Noticee mentioning that the invoice pertains to payment for PMS Service was an inadvertent error on part of its employee.  13. In the instant case, from the archived pages of the website, it was observed that the Noticee had advertised on its website that it offers PMS Advisory Services. It is also observed from archived records that the Noticee had placed job advertisement for PMS Executives on its website. I note here that such terms cannot be used lightly, least of all by an entity which is registered with SEBI. Hence, I am unable to accept the contention of the Noticee that it has not held itself out as a portfolio manager.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 14 of 22  14. Here, I take note of Regulation 3 of the PMS Regulations, which states the following:  \\\\\\\\u201c3. Registration as portfolio manager .\\\\\\\\u2500 No person shall act as portfolio manager unless he holds a certificate granted by the Board under these regulations:\\\\\\\\u201d  15. I note that though the requirement to get the certificate of registration triggers in before any one acts as a portfolio manager, the breach of the regulation would require, prima facie, evidence of some constituent acts towards acting as a portfolio manager. At this stage, details of any such constituent act, viz., agreement with the clients, collection of funds or control of funds pursuant to any such agreement with the clients, or evidence of construction of portfolio for clients are not available on record.  16. While I find certain merit in the submissions of the Noticee that the use of the term \\\\\\\\u201cPMS Advisory Services\\\\\\\\u201d may have been wrongly interpreted to mean that it has been providing portfolio management services, I note that pursuant to personal hearing the Noticee has furnished an authority letter which has purportedly been given by the complainant in favor of the Director, Mr. Rakesh Sethi. The said authority letter is submitted to support the case of Mr. Rakesh Sethi that he was given authority to accept and execute securities dealing orders on behalf of the complainant.   17. Here, I refer to the Regulation 2(cb) of the PMS Regulations, which defines \\\\\\\\u201cportfolio manager\\\\\\\\u201d as:  \\\\\\\\u201c2 (cb) \\\\\\\\u201cportfolio manager\\\\\\\\u201d means any person who pursuant to a contract or arrangement with a client, advises or directs or undertakes on behalf of the client (whether as a discretionary portfolio manager or otherwise) the management or administration of a portfolio of securities or goods or the funds of the client, as the case may be;\\\\\\\\u201d  18. I note that for portfolio management services to be provided by the Noticee, as per the PMS Regulations, the control/ management of funds/ securities is one of the main features for the portfolio management services.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 15 of 22  19. In view of the above definition, the above mentioned authority letter needs further examination. It also needs to be examined to find out whether pursuant to the above mentioned authority letter, Mr. Rakesh Sethi had control over the funds/ securities of the complainant. Therefore, I am of the view that further examination into the execution and use of such an authority letter vis-\\\\\\\\xe0-vis the act of the Noticee for acting as portfolio manager needs to be carried out.  20. I note that the Noticee has contended that it has not held itself and/ or acted as a portfolio manager as it has not complied with certain provisions of the PMS Regulations, viz., Regulations 15(1A) and 14(1a), which are required to be complied by a registered portfolio manager. I note that this contention cannot be accepted as the test to determine whether an entity has acted as an unregistered portfolio manager is to peruse of the scope of the definition of the \"portfolio manager\" and whether the act of the Noticee falls within the same. The fact that Noticee has not followed certain regulatory requirements, which are required to be complied with post registration, is irrelevant consideration for determination of whether the Noticee has held itself and/ or acted as an unregistered portfolio manager.  Offering assured returns:  21. I note here that the Noticee and its Directors have not denied the fact that they have advertised certain returns as part of the services offered by them viz., returns to the tune of 200-400% from the \\\\\\\\u201cWealth Creator Stock Future/BTST/STBT Scheme\\\\\\\\u201d, assured returns of 10% per month from the PMS Advisory Services, expected return of 100-200% from service/ product \\\\\\\\u201cModi 2019 to 2024 (Multibagger calls)\\\\\\\\u201d. Instead, the Noticee has contended that these are probable/ expected returns derived as per the \"available financial tools\\\\\\\\u201d and are a comparative estimate and that there was no promise of the assured returns. For the service/ product \\\\\\\\u201cModi 2019 to 2024 (Multibagger calls)\\\\\\\\u201d, the Noticee has contended that the contents are based on \\\\\\\\u201cmere assumptions\\\\\\\\u201d and it never made any promises to any of its clients for any assured returns.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of 3M Team Securities Services Pvt. Ltd.    Page 16 of 22  22. During the personal hearing, the Noticee was advised to specifically provide the basis on which these \\\\\\\\u201cprobable/ expected\\\\\\\\u201d returns have been arrived at for each service/ product. The same should be in a format that can be verified and is backed up with data. I note here that the Noticee has submitted that it recommends investment in market by the Rule of 72 and power of compounding effect. The Noticee has submitted that this Rule of 72 is a simple way to determine how long an investment will take to double given a fixed annual rate of interest. However, I note that this rule is used for fixed return instruments like fixed deposits, bonds, etc., where there is no market risk. I note that the Noticee has not provided the basis on which the returns of 200-400% could be arrived at from its \\\\\\\\u201cWealth Creator Stock Future/BTST/STBT Scheme\\\\\\\\u201d or 100-200% returns could be achieved from service/ product \\\\\\\\u201cModi 2019 to 2024 (Multibagger calls)\\\\\\\\u201d.  23. I note here that the Noticee, being a SEBI registered intermediary, is well aware that any form of returns, whether probable/ expected, cannot be committed or indicated for any investment service/ product since all investments in the securities market are subject to market risks.

Gold Crude Research (\\\\\\\\u201cfirm\\\\\\\\u201d) is a sole proprietorship firm of Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma registered under Madhya Pradesh Shop and Establishment Act, 1958 on June 17, 2015. Its registered address at the time of registration was, 411, Mukhiya Marg Parapada, Chata Marga, Mangalwar, Th. Dungla, Dist. Chittorgarh.   2. Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) received an anonymous complaint from an email id, sebiwhistleblower@gmail.com against Gold Crude Research wherein, the complainant, inter alia, alleged that Gold Crude Research was illegally involved in advisory services.   SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s EXAMINATION: 3. In view of the complaint received, SEBI carried out a preliminary examination in January, 2020 to ascertain whether unregistered investment advisory activities are being carried__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gold Crude Research and its Proprietor Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma     Page 2 of 20 out by the firm. To that end the website of the firm, www.goldcruderesearch.com, particulars of its bank accounts, KYC and Account Opening Forms of its bank accounts were perused to gather information. It is noted that above website is inactive as on date. However, the print out of the web pages of the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s website was taken when the aforesaid website was active and have been placed on record. However, it is prima facie observed that the firm is now operating through another website namely, wwwgoldcruderesearchcom.nowfloats.com. The reason for the aforesaid prima facie observation is that the information / material that was available on the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s earlier website including its correspondence address, telephone number and email address, is same as that appears on the second website. Thus, prima facie the firm is carrying out its activities under a different URL / web address.  4. SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s preliminary examination found as follows: 4.1. The firm and its sole proprietor, Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma are not registered with SEBI in the capacity of Investment Adviser or in any other capacity. 4.2. The website (earlier as well as the current) provides information that the firm provides advisory services in the commodities and forex space. 4.3. The firm has bank accounts in SBI Bank Ltd., Axis Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd. where multiple credits have been made from different sources.  Issues for Consideration and Prima Facie Findings 5. I have perused the material available on record such as investor complaint, information available on the website of the firm, bank statements, KYC and account opening forms sought from Banks. A preliminary examination of the material available on record was made in order to verify whether the firm has offered investment advisory services and collected money from various investors without registration from SEBI. In this context, prima facie, the following issues arise for determination in the instant matter: 5.1. Whether Gold Crude Research is holding itself out and/or acting as investment adviser? 5.2. If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether Gold Crude Research has, prima facie, violated any provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) read with SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (\\\\\\\\u201cIA__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gold Crude Research and its Proprietor Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma     Page 3 of 20 Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) and SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) (\\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d)? 5.3. If answers to issue nos. (1) & (2) are affirmative, who are all responsible for the violations? 5.4. If answer to issue no.  (2) is in affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any, should be issued against those who are responsible for the prima facie, violations?

Further, I note the following information gathered from the KYC, account opening forms and bank account statements collected from the banks viz., HDFC Bank and Axis Bank: 7.1. Gold Crude Reserach is a proprietorship concern of Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma. The communication address of the firm is mentioned as A-6, Chandra Nagar, Behind Swagat Garden, MR-9 Road Indore - 452010, Madhya Pradesh.  7.2. The nature of business is mentioned as service provider and under the heading \\\\\\\\u201cdetails of activity\\\\\\\\u201d, it is mentioned as commodity research. In the Axis Bank Ltd., field verification form, under the heading \\\\\\\\u201ctype of business activity\\\\\\\\u201d, it is mentioned as advisory firm.  8. Considering the above analysis of the details on the website of the firm and account opening forms with various banks, I, prima facie, observe that Gold Crude Research has represented as follows:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gold Crude Research and its Proprietor Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma     Page 6 of 20 a) Gold Crude Research has made representations as an investment advisory firm that provides tips for commodity markets and indices.  b) Gold Crude Research has made representations that it offers services in investment planning and strategy for consideration.  9. Considering the above facts and circumstances, especially the contents of the website of the firm coupled with the credit transactions in the bank accounts as detailed in preceding paragraphs, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees/ funds credited to the bank accounts, were for the purpose of providing the services indicated on the website of the firm. Hence, as reflected in the bank statements referred to above, I note that the firm has commenced with the collection of fees/ funds for the purpose of providing the services from June, 2015. Credence for the aforesaid prima facie, finding is further led from web archive (https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/http://goldcruderesearch.com/), which shows that the web page of Gold Crude Research has been \\\\\\\\u201csaved 57 times between July 9, 2015 and May 31, 2019.\\\\\\\\u201d  10. It is, prima facie, observed that Gold Crude Research is placing information in public domain / advertising by using its website, about various services offered by it in the securities market. Further, it is also, prima facie, observed that various packages are being offered by Gold Crude Research through its website to avail its services. The website claims the following advantages of availing its services in the securities market: 10.1. \\\\\\\\u201cWith 1 tip per day of at least 96% accuracy, a stop-loss of 25 points and target of 40 to 60 points, you can be assured of daily gains with GoldCrudeResearch\\\\\\\\u2019s sure shot commodity tips.\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u2013 Crude Oil package 10.2. \\\\\\\\u201cAt GoldCrudeResearch we have helped many a trader in making profits in the energy markets consistently with our proactive support and follow up on trading Tips.\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u2013 Energy Package 10.3. \\\\\\\\u201cWhen you subscribe to the bi-weekly calls on Crude oil and Natural Gas inventory from GoldCrudeResearch, you gain an early starter advantage in your crude investments. Combined with the lightning-fast analysis and demand forecast from the market experts at GoldCrudeResearch, you can expect a significant increase in both trade opportunities, as well as profits.\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u2013 Inventory Special package__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gold Crude Research and its Proprietor Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma     Page 7 of 20 10.4. \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026we provide daily updates on support and resistance levels, targets and stop-loss, and timely updates on your trades to ensure you do not lose out on any of the entry, hold or exit opportunities during each trading day.\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u2013 Bullion package  11. I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d   12. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is observed from the contents of the website of the firm that the firm is prima facie holding itself out as investment adviser by offering to provide investment advice as defined under regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations by offering to give advice related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription. Further, as noted from various bank accounts that there are multiple credit entries which when seen together with the contents of the website leads to the prima facie conclusion that the credit entries in the bank accounts are consideration for the investment advice given by the firm to its clients. Thus, prima facie Gold Crude Research is an investment adviser as defined under regulation 2 (m) of IA Regulations. 13. The fact that the proprietor of the firm, Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma in his reply (sent by email dated March 14, 2016) has admitted to offering services to national and international clients in Comex and MCX and the receipt of money in the bank statements, prima facie, shows that the credit for payment of fees is in fact meant for the advisory services actually rendered by the firm. Therefore, Gold Crude Research has not only held itself out as an investment adviser but has also acted as an investment adviser for consideration.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gold Crude Research and its Proprietor Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma     Page 8 of 20 Issue No. 2: If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether Gold Crude Research has, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act read with IA Regulations and PFUTP Regulations? 14. In order to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of SEBI Act reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  Further, as per regulation 3(1) of IA Regulations, the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d. 15. The activities of the firm, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that the firm is holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser. However, no material is available on record to indicate that the firm or its proprietor, Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma in his individual capacity is having a certificate of registration as investment adviser. In this context, it is noted that the firm and its proprietor, Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma in his individual capacity are not registered with SEBI in any capacity. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by the firm, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, leads to the conclusion that the firm is holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser without a certificate of registration from SEBI. In my view, these activities/ representations without holding the certificate of registration as investment adviser is__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gold Crude Research and its Proprietor Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma     Page 9 of 20 prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations. 16. Further, I would like to refer to the provisions of securities laws which are relevant to the present case i.e. Sections 12A (a), (b), (c) of SEBI Act and regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of PFUTP Regulations. The text of the aforesaid provisions is reproduced below: SEBI Act Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control Section 12A: No person shall directly or indirectly:   (a)  use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;               (b)  employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange; (c) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; PFUTP Regulations Regulation 3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities No person shall directly or indirectly- (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under; (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gold Crude Research and its Proprietor Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma     Page 10 of 20 (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under. 4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities. (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following, namely:- \\\\\\\\u2026 (k) an advertisement that is misleading or that contains information in a distorted manner and which may influence the decision of the investors\\\\\\\\u201d. 17. In my view, an unregistered investment advisor like Gold Crude Research can put investors at great risk as without having a registered investment advisor certificate, Gold Crude Research is holding itself out as an investment advisor and offers services through its website to investors with the objective of making money / collecting fees through subscriptions. The analysis of details of its bank accounts shows that Gold Crude Research has received money in various denominations from various individuals. These proceeds, as discussed in preceding paragraphs, prima facie, leads to the inference that it is consideration for the services that Gold Crude Research provide in the securities market. Furthermore, the firm has claimed the following: 17.1. Under the subscription package, Crude Oil, the firm has claimed as follows: \\\\\\\\u201cWith 1 tip per day of at least 96% accuracy, a stop-loss of 25 points and target of 40 to 60 points, you can be assured of daily gains with GoldCrudeResearch\\\\\\\\u2019s sure shot commodity tips.\\\\\\\\u201d 17.2. Under the subscription package, Natural Gas, the firm has claimed as follows: \\\\\\\\u201cGoldCrudeResearch\\\\\\\\u2019s Natural Gas trading Tips offering includes alongside accurate commodity tips and Natural Gas Inventory reports, granular reports of price and demand fluctuations and one trading call per day with an accuracy of at least 95%.\\\\\\\\u201d__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gold Crude Research and its Proprietor Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma     Page 11 of 20 18. It is observed that the firm has given assurance of daily gains. Also it has claimed that its accuracy is at least 95% - 96% in providing commodity tips under few of its packages. The same is prima facie not supported by any evidence as available on the webpages of the firm. Even, if it were true, it is prima facie observed that the conduct of the firm in claiming that its accuracy is at least 95% - 96% in providing commodity tips is not a full disclosure and is an active concealment of the material fact that past performance, is not a guarantee of future result. In other words, historical performance, if any, when presented, is purely for reference purposes and it is inaccurate to simply assume that these will extend into the future. Every investment in the market is subject to market risk and any investment made by the client can also run into losses and even become zero. Similarly, the claim of the company of assuring daily gains is prima facie an active concealment of the material fact that every investment in the market is subject to market risk. Considering the dynamics of the market, the returns from the investment in the market are unpredictable, no matter how much and for how long the investment is made. Any information that puts out for the consumption of its existing and prospective clients has to be done with great responsibility and should be of such nature that it enables investors to take reasoned and unbiased decisions regarding their investment. This act of conveying assured returns is prima facie, indulged for the purpose of luring customers in its net and thereby increasing its income. In light of the same, the acts of the firm to make incomplete disclosure and active concealment of material information, are non-genuine and deceptive acts and have been prima facie made with an intent to influence the client to avail its advisory services. 19. The above discussed omissions and act of Gold Crude Research, are prima facie, fraudulent and are covered within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d defined under regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations which reads as under: \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d includes any act, expression, omission or concealment committed whether in a deceitful manner or not by a person or by any other person with his connivance or by his agent while dealing in securities in order to induce another person or his agent to deal in securities, whether or not there is any wrongful gain or avoidance of any loss, and shall also include--__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gold Crude Research and its Proprietor Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma     Page 12 of 20 (1) a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of material fact in order that another person may act to his detriment; (2) a suggestion as to a fact which is not true by one who does not believe it to be true; (3) an active concealment of a fact by a person having knowledge or belief of the fact; (4) a promise made without any intention of performing it; (5) a representation made in a reckless and careless manner whether it be true or false; (6) any such act or omission as any other law specifically declares to be fraudulent; (7) deceptive behavior by a person depriving another of informed consent or full participation; (8) a false statement made without reasonable ground for believing it to be true; (9) the act of an issuer of securities giving out misinformation that affects the market price of the security, resulting in investors being effectively misled even though they did not rely on the statement itself or anything derived from it other than the market price.  And \\\\\\\\u201cfraudulent\\\\\\\\u201d shall be construed accordingly;   20. It is noted that prima facie, fraudulent activities / the conduct / act / practice of Gold Crude Research as discussed above are prima facie in violation of provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b), (c) of SEBI Act and regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of PFUTP Regulations.  Issue No. 3: If answers to issue nos. (1) & (2) are affirmative, who are responsible for the violations? 21. I note that Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma is the sole proprietor of Gold Crude Research. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme court in Ashok Transport Agency vs. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business. . A suit by or against a proprietary concern is by or against the proprietor of the business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma is liable for the acts of Gold Crude Research.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gold Crude Research and its Proprietor Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma     Page 13 of 20 Issue No. 4: If answer to issue no. (2) is affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any, should be issued against those responsible for the prima facie, violations? 22. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market.  Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The PFUTP Regulations and the IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of banning fraud and regulating IA activities to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of IA activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations, inter alia, seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the criteria set out in the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market. 23. In the instant case, Gold Crude Research is soliciting and inducing investors to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, commodity tips etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration / certification as mandated under the IA Regulations. Similarly, the PFUTP Regulations seeks to curb fraudulent and manipulative activities in the securities market in order to boost investor confidence in the securities market and to provide an environment conductive to increased participation and investment in the securities market which is vital to the growth and development of the economy. Further, it is noted from material available on record, the website is active as on date and can lure investors to avail the firm services. Furthermore, the very act of the firm to change its URL / website address prima facie, shows that the firm is trying to avoid regulatory detection and is determined in continuing its unregistered investment advisory activities.  24. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Gold Crude Research through its proprietor, from collecting any more fees from the public and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. I note that the website is active as on date and the investors can reach__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gold Crude Research and its Proprietor Mr. Ramnarayan Sharma     Page 14 of 20 Gold Crude Research through its email info@goldcruderesearch.com as available on its website as well as through telephone, 8080808209 as mentioned on its website. The said telephone number is also active as per https://www.findandtrace.com. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Gold Crude Research in the securities market is still in existence and imminent. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Gold Crude Research is Rs. 2,95,32,574/- and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.   25. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from the unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from unregistered investment advisor vis-a-vis an investor who receives such service from a registered investment adviser in consonance with the IA Regulations stands at a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection a", "Date": "2020-12-07", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Interim Order in the matter of M/s.

Order in the matter of Mishka Finance and Trading Limited                                                          Page 5 of 154 Background \\\\\\\\u2013 1. Pursuant to detection of a huge rise in the traded volume and price of the scrip of Mishka Finance and Trading Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cMishka\\\\\\\\u201d/ the \\\\\\\\u201cCompany\\\\\\\\u201d), formerly known as Pyramid Trading and Finance Limited, on the Bombay Stock Exchange Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cBSE\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI conducted an investigation to ascertain the violation of the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India  Act, 1992 (the \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (the \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) in the scrip for the period, February 14, 2013 to December 31, 2014 (the \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d). The price of the shares of Mishka, moved from Rs.5.50 on February 14, 2013 to Rs.327.25 on January 15, 2014. Further to the above, the share of Mishka was split, from one share of face value Rs.10 to 10 shares of face value Rs.1 each on January 16, 2014. Thereafter, the price of the scrip touched a high of Rs.49.90 on February 14, 2014. 2. Upon preliminary inquiry, SEBI prima facie observed that Mishka made a preferential allotment during 2012-13. Once the shares were allotted to the preferential allottees/promoter related group, certain entities started moving the price of the scrip upwards by trading in very low volumes. Subsequent to the release of compulsory lock-in period for 1 year, the Preferential Allottees and the Promoter related entities were provided exit at a high price by certain entities allegedly related/connected amongst themselves and with Mishka. 3. By virtue of the same, it was alleged that the Company and persons in charge of its affairs created preferential allotment of shares as a mode to provide fictitious long  Order in the matter of Mishka Finance and Trading Limited                                                          Page 6 of 154 term capital gains (\\\\\\\\u201cLTCG\\\\\\\\u201d) to its Preferential Allottees and Promoter related entities so as to convert their unaccounted income into accounted one; its Promoters/Directors, Exit Providers, Preferential Allottees and the Promoter related entities artificially increased the volume and price of the scrip and misused securities market system for making illegal gains and to convert ill-gotten gains into genuine one to avail LTCG.  4. Accordingly, the following actions were initiated in the matter: Table \\\\\\\\u2013 1 Sl. No. Event Date  1. Ad interim ex-parte order (\\\\\\\\u201cInterim Order\\\\\\\\u201d) passed by SEBI upon the finding that Mishka and its Promoters, Directors and other suspected entities totalling to 129 were prima facie in violation of the SEBI Act and the PFUTP Regulations, and as such the said entities were restrained from accessing the securities market and further prohibited from buying, selling or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, till further directions. April 17, 2015 2. Order passed by SEBI revoking the directions issued against Jayesh N Kesharia, one of the 129 entities mentioned in the above-mentioned Interim Order.  November 10, 2015  Order in the matter of Mishka Finance and Trading Limited                                                          Page 7 of 154 3. Order passed by SEBI revoking the directions issued against Bharat Bagriand and Manjulaben Sukhdev, part of the 129 entities mentioned in the above-mentioned Interim Order. August 26, 2016 4. Confirmatory Orders numbering total of six (6)  passed by SEBI confirming the directions passed against the remaining 126 entities  October 12, 2015; October 21, 2015; November 10, 2015;  April 13, 2016; July 05, 2016; and August 26, 2016  Order in the matter of Mishka Finance and Trading Limited                                                          Page 8 of 154 5.    Order issued by SEBI revoking directions issued against 113 entities* vide the above-mentioned Interim Order, and confirmed thereto by the confirmatory orders mentioned above.  *Subsequent to the Interim Order and confirmatory orders thereto, SEBI conducted a detailed investigation with respect to the remaining 126 entities. Upon completion of investigation, no adverse findings were made out against 104 entities with respect to their role in the price manipulation /prima facie warranting continuation of action under Sections 11B and 11(4) of the SEBI Act for the violation of provisions of SEBI Act and PFUTP Regulations. Further with regard to 9 entities, no adverse material was found in the Investigation Report with respect to prima facie violations found against them in the Interim Order, and subsequently confirmed. The Investigation Report, though, brought out violations relating to disclosure under SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 and SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares And Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 warranting Adjudication Proceedings in respect of the 9 entities. Therefore, the said Order was passed revoking the directions against 113 entities.  October 05, 2017   5. From the above chronology, it follows that the Interim order was not revoked against 13 entities, i.e. Noticee Nos.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 25, 26, 28, 39 and 59 named in the SCN, after a detailed investigation.  Order in the matter of Mishka Finance and Trading Limited                                                          Page 9 of 154  The Show-cause Notice 6. Accordingly, based on the investigation, a common Show Cause Notice dated December 12, 2017 (the \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to 60 Noticees (13 Noticees against whom the Interim Order was not revoked and 47 new Noticees) named above, calling upon the said Noticees to show cause as to why suitable directions under sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 should not be issued against them for the allegations contained therein. 7. The substantive allegations contained in the SCN are provided hereunder: False and Misleading Objects of the Preferential Issue (Noticee Nos. 1 to 7) 7.1. The Company on September 24, 2012 issued 7,93,700 shares on preferential basis to 46 entities at Rs.85 per share (Face value of Rs.10 per share at premium of Rs.75 per share). Before the preferential allotments, the company had a total shareholding of 4,98,000 shares. It was observed that one Preferential Allottee, namely Pearl Arcade Trading Pvt Ltd was introduced as a Promoter of the Company. The shares issued under preferential allotment were under lock-in till September 23, 2013.  7.2. It was observed that the special resolution passed under section 81(1A) of the Companies Act, 1956, disclosed the following purposes for fund raising through preferential allotment: \\\\\\\\u25aa Capital expenditure including acquisition of company/business;  Order in the matter of Mishka Finance and Trading Limited                                                          Page 10 of 154 \\\\\\\\u25aa Funding long term working capital requirements; \\\\\\\\u25aa Marketing \\\\\\\\u25aa Setting up of offices abroad; and \\\\\\\\u25aa For other approved corporate purposes. 7.3. Upon investigation in the matter, it was observed that there were neither additions to the fixed assets of the Company nor any mention of capital work-in-progress. Further, the cash flow statement for these years did not have any cash flow relating to acquisition and development of moveable and immovable property (i.e. negative cash flow from investing activities); on the contrary company sold its existing investments in the F.Y. 2012-13 and 2013-14. It was also observed that Mishka instead of utilising the preferential issue proceeds for the purpose, as stated in the notices of the general meetings wherein preferential allotments of shares were approved, used it for extending loans & advances etc. 7.4. Thus, the SCN has alleged that Mishka (Noticee No. 1) and its six directors (Noticee No. 2 to 7) during the financial years 2012-13 & 2013-14 namely Ankit Om Prakash Garodia, Jugalkishore Sharma, Amit Kumar Vasishtha, Rameshwar Manohar Wagh, Anand Gupta and Vijay Kumar Jain, presented false and misleading objects of the preferential issue to shareholders in Notice of General Meeting of the members of the Company held on September 03, 2012, and as such, Noticee Nos. 1 to 7 are alleged to have violated Section 12A (a), (b) and (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(f)(k) and (r) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003.  Order in the matter of Mishka Finance and Trading Limited                                                          Page 11 of 154 Manipulation of the Share Price of the Company (Noticee Nos. 8 to 60) 7.5. As on September 30, 2011, the total shareholding of the Company was 4,98,000 shares (held by seven entities and entire shares were in physical mode) of which 4,19,700 shares i.e. 84.28% of total shareholding were held by four Promoter entities, namely,  Embassy Finance & Consultants Pvt Ltd, Wave Inter Trades Pvt Ltd, Tohee Trading & Agencies Pvt Ltd, and Sulabh Impex Limited and remaining 78,300 shares i.e. 15.72% of total shareholding were held by three entities namely Vijay Kumar Jain, Ankit Jain and Rashmi Jain, the details of which are as follows: Table-2 Sr. No. Name Category No. of Shares Held % of Total Paid up Capital As on 30-Sep-2011 1 Embassy Finance & Consultants Pvt Ltd  Promoter 1,24,500 25.00% 2 Tohee Trading & Agencies Pvt Ltd Promoter 1,21,200 24.34% 3 Wave Inter Trades Pvt Ltd Promoter 1,24,000 24.90% 4 Sulabh Impex Limited Promoter 50,000 10.04% Total Promoter Shareholding (A) 4,19,700 84.28% 5 Vijay Kumar Jain Director 36,000 7.23% 6 Ankit Jain Son of Director 32,000 6.42% 7 Rashmi Jain Wife of Director 10,300 2.07% Total Non Promoter Shareholding (B) 78,300 15.72%  Order in the matter of Mishka Finance and Trading Limited                                                          Page 12 of 154 Total Shareholding of the company (A+B) 4,98,000 100.00%  7.6. It was observed during investigation that the above seven entities were connected to each other. Thus, the entire shareholding of the Company was with the aforesaid seven connected entities only, as on 30 September, 2011. 7.7. On December 26, 2011, Sulabh Impex Limited transferred its entire shareholding of 50,000 shares to Ankit Jain through an off-market transfer. Thereafter, six entities (four Promoter entities namely, Tohee Trading & Agencies Pvt Ltd, Wave Inter Trades Pvt Ltd, Embassy Finance and Consultants Pvt Ltd and Vijay Kumar Jain and relatives of Promoter namely Ankit Jain and Rashmi Jain) transferred their entire shareholding (except 2,000 shares of Embassy Finance & Consultants Pvt Ltd) i.e. 4,96,000 in off-market transactions in physical form to 383 entities during the period, December 30, 2011 to February 04, 2013 on 12 dates. Six Promoters and Promoter related entities, stated in their replies that they sold the shares through Roongta Rising Stock Private Limited (hereafter referred as \\\\\\\\u201cRRSPL\\\\\\\\u201d) and received the payment of Rs. 21,21,500 (85.54%) directly from RRSPL and Rs. 3,58,500 (14.46%) from the buyers as per instructions of RRSPL. These entities provided copies of bank statements showing payment received from RRSPL and a copy of letter issued by RRSPL to accept Rs.3,58,500 (14.46%) directly from the buyers. 7.8. Investigation revealed that six Promoters and Promoter related entities had transferred 99.60% of their shareholding (4,96,000 shares) to 383 entities and  Order in the matter of Mishka Finance and Trading Limited                                                          Page 13 of 154 out of which 19 entities further transferred to 69 entities. Therefore ultimately, 99.60% of promoter shareholding was transferred to 452 entities. 7.9. The entities (who received shares in off-market from six promoters and promoter related entities), except Anil Satyanarayan Roongta, A. K. Roongta HUF and Sudha Anil Roongta which are entities related to Roongta, stated that they came to know about shares of Mishka from a newspaper advertisement published by RRSPL. 7.10. Accordingly, the SCN has alleged that RRSPL devised a scheme to manipulate the price of the scrip by issuing an advertisement buying shares from the promoter entities and manipulating the price of the scrip. As a Company functions through its directors, Anil Satyanarayan Roongta and Sudha Anil Roongta (Noticee No. 8 and 9) being directors of RRSPL , were alleged to have violated the provisions of Regulations 3(a)(b)(c)(d) and 4(1) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003. 7.11. Further, 53 entities (Noticee No. 8 to 60) were alleged to have indulged in an act amounting to manipulation of price of the scrip in Patch-1 and Patch-2. Further, these noticees, except Noticee No. 58 to 60, namely Chandravati M Shah, Manharlal N Shah and Nikunj S Agarwal, are also alleged to have sold the shares at inflated price and booked substantial profit. Hence, the 53 entities (Noticee No. 8 to 60)  have been alleged to have violated Regulation 3(a),(b),(c),(d) and Regulation 4(1), 4(2) (a) & 4(2) (e) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003.

However, as settlement applications had been filed by certain Noticees (listed out in Table \\\\\\\\u2013 4 above), whose roles in the matter had a distinct connection with the other Noticees; the present proceedings could not have been concluded before the disposal of the said Settlement Applications. Further opportunity of personal hearing was granted on August 28, 2020 to certain Noticees, who had sought an extension of time for personal hearing and to certain other Noticees who had not appeared for personal hearing before. Further to the said hearing on August 28, 2020, an opportunity was provided to the Noticees who had been heard to submit written submissions, if they so wished.

PM/NR/2020-21/9751 UNDER SECTION15-I OF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA ACT, 1992 READ WITH RULE 5 OF SEBI (PROCEDURE FOR HOLDING INQUIRY AND IMPOSING PENALTIES) RULES, 1995  In respect of Rays Global Corporation (PAN: AAFCR2508C)    In the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  BACKGROUND 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) observed from the quarterly shareholding pattern of Karuturi Global Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cTarget Company\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cKGL\\\\\\\\u201d),  a Company listed at National Stock Exchange (NSE),  for the quarter ending period June 2015 and September 2015, that the shareholding of Rays Global Corporation (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) which  held 4,10,00,000 shares of KGL constituting 5.06% of the share capital of KGL as at the quarter ending period June 2015,  had decreased to 1,18,75,000 shares i.e., 1.16% of the share capital of KGL as at the quarter ending period September 2015.   2. The change in shareholding of the Noticee had triggered disclosure requirements under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares & Takeovers), 2011 (hereinafter referred to \\\\\\\\u201cSAST Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). It was observed that the Noticee failed to make the requisite disclosures under SEBI (SAST) Regulations to the Stock Exchange where the shares of the target company are listed i.e., NSE and to the target company. Therefore, it was alleged that the Noticee had violated the provisions of Regulation 29 (2) read with Regulation 29 (3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER Adjudication Order in respect of Rays Global Corporation in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 2 of 9   3. Pursuant to examination, SEBI initiated Adjudication Proceedings against the Noticee and appointed the undersigned as the Adjudicating Officer vide Order dated October 17, 2019 under Section 19 of SEBI Act read with Sub-section (1) of Section 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Rule 3 of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge the alleged violation committed by the Noticee, under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  4. A Show Cause Notice (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) bearing ref. no. EAD/ADJ/PM/AB/OW/0000013127/2020 dated August 12, 2020 was served on the Noticee under Rule 4 of SEBI Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry be not held against it in terms of Rule 4 of the SEBI Adjudication Rules and penalty be not imposed under Section 15 A (b) of the SEBI Act, 1992 for the violation alleged to have been committed by it. In view of the prevailing circumstances owing to Covid-19 pandemic, the SCN was sent to the Noticee through digitally signed email at it\\\\\\\\u2019s Email IDs: jessica.chiatrustnet@gmail.com and jesphin.silva@portcullis-trustnet.com on August 12, 2020. I note that while the SCN sent to Email ID jesphin.silva@portcullis-trustnet.com bounced, the SCN sent to the Email ID jessica.chiatrustnet@gmail.com did not bounce. Vide the aforesaid SCN, the Noticee was given a timeframe of 21 days to submit its reply, if any, to the charges alleged in the SCN. I note from the records that the Noticee did not file its reply.   5. In the interest of natural justice and in terms of Rule 4(3) of SEBI Adjudication Rules, the Noticee was given an opportunity of personal hearing on November 12, 2020, which was communicated to the Noticee at it\\\\\\\\u2019s Email ID jessica.chiatrustnet@gmail.com on October 29, 2020, sent through digitally signed email. I note that the email sent to the Noticee at the abovementioned Email ID did not bounce. In view of the prevailing circumstances owing to Covid-19 pandemic, the hearing was scheduled through videoconferencing on Adjudication Order in respect of Rays Global Corporation in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 3 of 9  Webex platform on November 12, 2020 and the link for joining the hearing along with the login credentials were sent to the Noticee through email at it\\\\\\\\u2019s Email ID jessica.chiatrustnet@gmail.com on November 11, 2020. However, I note that the Noticee neither submitted it\\\\\\\\u2019s reply nor appeared for the hearing. 6. In this context, I would like to rely upon the observations of The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in the matter of Classic Credit Ltd., vs. SEBI (Appeal  68 of 2003 decided on December 08, 2006) wherein the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, inter alia, observed that - \"............ the appellants did not file any reply to the second show-cause notice. This being so, it has to be presumed that the charges alleged against them in the show-cause notice were admitted by them\\\\\\\\u201d.  7. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT has again in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Others vs SEBI (Appeal  68 of 2013 decided on February 11, 2014), interalia, observed that \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026As rightly contended by Mr. Rustomjee, learned senior counsel for respondents, appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted charges levelled against them in the show cause notices\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d.  8. In view of the above, I note that the Noticee, even after due service of Notices, has neither provided any reply to the allegations made in the SCN nor availed the opportunity of personal hearing to advance it\\\\\\\\u2019s submissions before me. Therefore, I am convinced that the principle of natural justice has been duly followed in the matter, as enough opportunities were provided to the Noticees to reply to the SCN and to appear for hearing. In such circumstance, the allegations in the SCN against the Noticee are taken up for consideration, on the basis of the material available on record  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES Adjudication Order in respect of Rays Global Corporation in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 4 of 9  9. I have taken into consideration the facts and material available on record. I observe that the allegation levelled against the Noticee is that it has failed to make the requisite disclosures under the relevant provisions of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011.    After perusal  of  the material  available  on  record,  I  have  the  following  issues  for consideration, viz.,  I. Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 29 (2) read with Regulation 29 (3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011?  II. Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 15 A (b) of SEBI Act.?  III. If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?  ISSUE-I: Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 29 (2) read with Regulation 29 (3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations?  10. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of SEBI  (SAST) Regulations, 2011, which reads as under:  Regulation 29 (2) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011 Any person, who together with persons acting in concert with him, holds shares or voting rights entitling them to five per cent or more of the shares or voting rights in a target company, shall disclose the number of shares or voting rights held and change   in   shareholding   or   voting   rights,   even   if   such change   results   in shareholding falling below five per cent, if there has been change in such holdings from  the  last  disclosure  made  under  sub-regulation  (1)  or  under  this  sub-regulation; and such change exceeds two per cent of total shareholding or voting rights in the target company, in such form as may be specified. Adjudication Order in respect of Rays Global Corporation in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 5 of 9   Regulation 29 (3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011 \\\\\\\\u201cThe disclosures required under sub-regulation (1) and sub-regulation (2) shall be made within two working days of the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares, or the acquisition of shares or voting rights in the target company to, (a) every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed; and (b) the target company at its registered office\\\\\\\\u201d.  11. I note that it is obligatory on the part of any person who holds more than 5% of shareholding, to make the requisite disclosure to the Stock Exchange and to Company, in case of any change in shareholding in excess of 2% or more within 2 working days.   12. I note that the Noticee is a shareholder of KGL holding 4,10,00,000 shares representing 5.06% of the shareholding of KGL as at the quarter ending period June 2015. The shareholding of the Noticee decreased to 1,18,75,000 shares representing 1.16% of the shareholding of KGL as at the quarter ending period September 2015. The total change in the shareholding of the Noticee was 3.9%. Pursuant to change in shareholding in excess of 2% or more, the Noticee is obligated to make the requisite disclosures in terms of Regulation 29 (2) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations to NSE and to the target company. I note from the email of NSE dated June 27, 2017 and from the email of KGL dated August 17, 2017 that no disclosures were received by NSE & KGL from the Noticee pursuant to it\\\\\\\\u2019s change in shareholding in excess of more than 2% in the target company. There is no material even to indicate any subsequent disclosures about the transaction in reasonable time. Thus, this is case of complete failure on the part of the Noticee who is public shareholder in KGL.  13. From the above findings and also from the confirmations provided by NSE & KGL, it is established that the Noticee failed to make the requisite disclosures under Regulation 29 (2) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations pursuant to change in more than 2% shareholding in the target company. Adjudication Order in respect of Rays Global Corporation in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 6 of 9  14. In the matter of Appeal No. 66 of 2003 -Milan Mahendra Securities Pvt. Ltd. vs. SEBI\\\\\\\\u2013the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, vide its order dated April 15, 2005 also held that, \\\\\\\\u201cthe purpose of these disclosures is to bring about transparency in the transactions and assist the Regulator to effectively monitor the transactions in the market.\\\\\\\\u201d  15. Further, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in its Order dated September 30, 2014, in the matter of Akriti Global Traders Ltd. Vs SEBI had observed that:  \\\\\\\\u201cObligation to make disclosures under the provisions contained in SAST Regulations, 2011 as also under PIT Regulations, 1992 would arise as soon as there is acquisition of shares by a person in excess of the limits prescribed under the respective regulations and it is immaterial as to how the shares are acquired. Therefore, irrespective of the fact as to whether the shares were purchased from open market or shares were received on account of amalgamation or by way of bonus shares, if, as a result of such acquisition/ receipt, percentage of shares held by that person exceeds the limits prescribed under the respective regulations, then, it is mandatory to make disclosures under those regulations.\\\\\\\\u201d  16. In view of the foregoing, I conclude that the Noticee by not making the requisite disclosures upon change in more than 2% shareholding in the target company has violated the provisions of Regulation 29 (2) read with Regulation 29 (3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations.   ISSUE \\\\\\\\u2013 II: Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 15 A (b) of SEBI Act.? 17. It is a well-known fact and practice that as per the requirements of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, there is a requirement of timely disclosure of change in shareholding beyond certain threshold limits. It is obligatory on the part of the person to make timely disclosures to Stock Exchange and to the Company. By not making the requisite disclosures under SEBI (SAST) Regulations, the Adjudication Order in respect of Rays Global Corporation in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 7 of 9  Noticee failed to comply with the statutory requirements of Law. The timely disclosure is mandated under these Regulations for the benefit of the investors at large. There can be no dispute that compliance with the provisions of the Regulations is mandatory and it is the duly of SEBI to enforce compliance of these Regulations.   18. Since the violation of the statutory obligation under the provisions of SEBI (SAST) Regulations has been established against the Noticee, the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under Section 15 A (b) of SEBI Act. The provisions of Section 15 A (b) of SEBI Act are reproduced hereunder.   Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc.  Section 15A of SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2013 If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder:-, (b)  to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees  ISSUE \\\\\\\\u2013 III: If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?  19. While determining the quantum of monetary penalty under Section 15 A (b) of SEBI Act, I have considered the factors stipulated in Section 15-J of SEBI Act, which reads as under:   Section 15J - Factors to be taken into account by the Adjudicating Officer    While  adjudging  quantum  of  penalty  under  section  15 - I,  the  Adjudicating  Officer  shall have due regard to the following factors, namely: (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever Adjudication Order in respect of Rays Global Corporation in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 8 of 9  quantifiable, made as a result of the default;  (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  20. The material made available on record has not quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee and the loss suffered by the investors as a result of the Noticee's default. There is also no material made available on record to assess the amount of loss caused to investors or the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee as a result of default. However, it is important to note that timely disclosure of information, as prescribed under the statute, is an important regulatory tool intended to serve a public purpose. Timely disclosures are also an essential part of the proper functioning of the securities market and failure to do so prevents investors from taking a well-informed investment decision.   21. Therefore, I am not inclined to view the lapse on the part of the Noticee leniently and consider it necessary to impose monetary penalty which would act as deterrent to the Noticee in future.   ORDER 22. Having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the SEBI Adjudication Rules, hereby impose a penalty of \\\\\\\\u20b92,00,000/- (Rupees Two lakhs only) on the Noticee i.e., Rays Global Corporation for violation of the provisions of Regulation 29 (2) read with Regulation 29 (3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011, under Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act.  23. The said penalty imposed on the Noticee, as mentioned above, is commensurate with the violation committed and acts as a deterrent factor for the Noticee and others in protecting the interest of investors. Adjudication Order in respect of Rays Global Corporation in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 9 of 9  24. The Noticee shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days from the date of receipt of this Order, either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR through online payment facility available on the SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in on the following path by clicking on the payment link.

Investment Ltd., in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 1 of 9  BEFORE THE ADJUDICATING OFFICER SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OFINDIA ADJUDICATION ORDER NO. PM/NR/2020-21/9750 UNDER SECTION15-I OF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA ACT, 1992 READ WITH RULE 5 OF SEBI (PROCEDURE FOR HOLDING INQUIRY AND IMPOSING PENALTIES) RULES, 1995  In respect of Maxworth Investment Ltd., (PAN: AAHCM0498G)    In the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  BACKGROUND 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) observed from the quarterly shareholding pattern of Karuturi Global Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cTarget Company\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cKGL\\\\\\\\u201d),  a Company listed at National Stock Exchange (NSE),  for the quarter ending period June 2015 and September 2015, that the shareholding of Maxworth Investment Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) which  held 4,10,00,000 shares of KGL constituting 5.06% of the share capital of KGL as at the quarter ending period June 2015,  had decreased to 1,18,75,000 shares i.e., 1.16% of the share capital of KGL as at the quarter ending period September 2015.   2. The change in shareholding of the Noticee had triggered disclosure requirements under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares & Takeovers), 2011 (hereinafter referred to \\\\\\\\u201cSAST Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). It was observed that the Noticee failed to make the requisite disclosures under SEBI (SAST) Regulations to the Stock Exchange where the shares of the target company are listed i.e., NSE and to the target company. Therefore, it was alleged that the Noticee had violated the provisions of Regulation 29 (2) read with Regulation 29 (3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER Adjudication Order in respect of Maxworth Investment Ltd., in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 2 of 9   3. Pursuant to examination, SEBI initiated Adjudication Proceedings against the Noticee and appointed the undersigned as the Adjudicating Officer vide Order dated October 17, 2019 under Section 19 of SEBI Act read with Sub-section (1) of Section 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Rule 3 of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge the alleged violation committed by the Noticee, under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  4. A Show Cause Notice (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) bearing ref. no. EAD/ADJ/PM/AB/OW/0000013128/2020 dated August 12, 2020 was served on the Noticee under Rule 4 of SEBI Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry be not held against it in terms of Rule 4 of the SEBI Adjudication Rules and penalty be not imposed under Section 15 A (b) of the SEBI Act, 1992 for the violation alleged to have been committed by it. In view of the prevailing circumstances owing to Covid-19 pandemic, the SCN was sent to the Noticee through digitally signed email at it\\\\\\\\u2019s Email IDs: jessica.chiatrustnet@gmail.com and jesphin.silva@portcullis-trustnet.com on August 12, 2020. I note that while the SCN sent to Email ID the email sent to jesphin.silva@portcullis-trustnet.com bounced, the SCN sent to the Email ID jessica.chiatrustnet@gmail.com did not bounce. Vide the aforesaid SCN, the Noticee was given a timeframe of 21 days to submit its reply, if any, to the charges alleged in the SCN. I note from the records that the Noticee did not file its reply.   5. In the interest of natural justice and in terms of Rule 4(3) of SEBI Adjudication Rules, the Noticee was given an opportunity of personal hearing on November 12, 2020, which was communicated to the Noticee at it\\\\\\\\u2019s Email ID jessica.chiatrustnet@gmail.com on October 29, 2020, sent through digitally signed email. I note that the email sent to the Noticee at the abovementioned Email ID did not bounce. In view of the prevailing circumstances owing to Covid-19 pandemic, the hearing was scheduled through videoconferencing on Adjudication Order in respect of Maxworth Investment Ltd., in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 3 of 9  Webex platform on November 12, 2020 and the link for joining the hearing along with the login credentials were sent to the Noticee through email at it\\\\\\\\u2019s Email ID jessica.chiatrustnet@gmail.com on November 11, 2020. However, I note that the Noticee neither submitted it\\\\\\\\u2019s reply nor appeared for the hearing.  6. In this context, I would like to rely upon the observations of The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in the matter of Classic Credit Ltd., vs. SEBI (Appeal  68 of 2003 decided on December 08, 2006) wherein the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, inter alia, observed that - \"............ the appellants did not file any reply to the second show-cause notice. This being so, it has to be presumed that the charges alleged against them in the show-cause notice were admitted by them\\\\\\\\u201d.  7. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT has again in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Others vs SEBI (Appeal  68 of 2013 decided on February 11, 2014), interalia, observed that \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026As rightly contended by Mr. Rustomjee, learned senior counsel for respondents, appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted charges levelled against them in the show cause notices\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d.  8. In view of the above, I note that the Noticee, even after due service of Notices, has neither provided any reply to the allegations made in the SCN nor availed the opportunity of personal hearing to advance it\\\\\\\\u2019s submissions before me. Therefore, I am convinced that the principle of natural justice has been duly followed in the matter, as enough opportunities were provided to the Noticees to reply to the SCN and to appear for hearing. In such circumstance, the allegations in the SCN against the Noticee are taken up for consideration, on the basis of the material available on record  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES Adjudication Order in respect of Maxworth Investment Ltd., in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 4 of 9  9. I have taken into consideration the facts and material available on record. I observe that the allegation levelled against the Noticee is that it has failed to make the requisite disclosures under the relevant provisions of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011.    After perusal  of  the material  available  on  record,  I  have  the  following  issues  for consideration, viz.,  I. Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 29 (2) read with Regulation 29 (3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011?  II. Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 15 A (b) of SEBI Act.?  III. If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?  ISSUE-I: Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 29 (2) read with Regulation 29 (3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations?  10. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of SEBI  (SAST) Regulations, 2011, which reads as under:  Regulation 29 (2) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011 Any person, who together with persons acting in concert with him, holds shares or voting rights entitling them to five per cent or more of the shares or voting rights in a target company, shall disclose the number of shares or voting rights held and change   in   shareholding   or   voting   rights,   even   if   such change   results   in shareholding falling below five per cent, if there has been change in such holdings from  the  last  disclosure  made  under  sub-regulation  (1)  or  under  this  sub-regulation; and such change exceeds two per cent of total shareholding or voting rights in the target company, in such form as may be specified. Adjudication Order in respect of Maxworth Investment Ltd., in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 5 of 9   Regulation 29 (3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011 \\\\\\\\u201cThe disclosures required under sub-regulation (1) and sub-regulation (2) shall be made within two working days of the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares, or the acquisition of shares or voting rights in the target company to, (a) every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed; and (b) the target company at its registered office\\\\\\\\u201d.  11. I note that it is obligatory on the part of any person who holds more than 5% of shareholding, to make the requisite disclosure to the Stock Exchange and to Company, in case of any change in shareholding in excess of 2% or more within 2 working days.   12. I note that the Noticee is a shareholder of KGL holding 4,10,00,000 shares representing 5.06% of the shareholding of KGL as at the quarter ending period June 2015. The shareholding of the Noticee decreased to 1,18,75,000 shares representing 1.16% of the shareholding of KGL as at the quarter ending period September 2015. The total change in the shareholding of the Noticee was 3.9%. Pursuant to change in shareholding in excess of 2% or more, the Noticee is obligated to make the requisite disclosures in terms of Regulation 29 (2) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations to NSE and to the target company. I note from the email of NSE dated June 27, 2017 and from the email of KGL dated August 17, 2017 that no disclosures were received by NSE & KGL from the Noticee pursuant to it\\\\\\\\u2019s change in shareholding in excess of more than 2% in the target company. There is no material even to indicate any subsequent disclosures about the transaction in reasonable time. Thus, this is case of complete failure on the part of the Noticee who is public shareholder in KGL.  13. From the above findings and also from the confirmations provided by NSE & KGL, it is established that the Noticee failed to make the requisite disclosures under Regulation 29 (2) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations pursuant to change in more than 2% shareholding in the target company. Adjudication Order in respect of Maxworth Investment Ltd., in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 6 of 9  14. In the matter of Appeal No. 66 of 2003 -Milan Mahendra Securities Pvt. Ltd. vs. SEBI\\\\\\\\u2013the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, vide its order dated April 15, 2005 also held that, \\\\\\\\u201cthe purpose of these disclosures is to bring about transparency in the transactions and assist the Regulator to effectively monitor the transactions in the market.\\\\\\\\u201d  15. Further, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in its Order dated September 30, 2014, in the matter of Akriti Global Traders Ltd. Vs SEBI had observed that:  \\\\\\\\u201cObligation to make disclosures under the provisions contained in SAST Regulations, 2011 as also under PIT Regulations, 1992 would arise as soon as there is acquisition of shares by a person in excess of the limits prescribed under the respective regulations and it is immaterial as to how the shares are acquired. Therefore, irrespective of the fact as to whether the shares were purchased from open market or shares were received on account of amalgamation or by way of bonus shares, if, as a result of such acquisition/ receipt, percentage of shares held by that person exceeds the limits prescribed under the respective regulations, then, it is mandatory to make disclosures under those regulations.\\\\\\\\u201d  16. In view of the foregoing, I conclude that the Noticee by not making the requisite disclosures upon change in more than 2% shareholding in the target company has violated the provisions of Regulation 29 (2) read with Regulation 29 (3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations.   ISSUE \\\\\\\\u2013 II: Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 15 A (b) of SEBI Act.? 17. It is a well-known fact and practice that as per the requirements of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, there is a requirement of timely disclosure of change in shareholding beyond certain threshold limits. It is obligatory on the part of the person to make timely disclosures to Stock Exchange and to the Company. By not making the requisite disclosures under SEBI (SAST) Regulations, the Adjudication Order in respect of Maxworth Investment Ltd., in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 7 of 9  Noticee failed to comply with the statutory requirements of Law. The timely disclosure is mandated under these Regulations for the benefit of the investors at large. There can be no dispute that compliance with the provisions of the Regulations is mandatory and it is the duly of SEBI to enforce compliance of these Regulations.   18. Since the violation of the statutory obligation under the provisions of SEBI (SAST) Regulations has been established against the Noticee, the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under Section 15 A (b) of SEBI Act. The provisions of Section 15 A (b) of SEBI Act are reproduced hereunder.   Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc.  Section 15A of SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2013 If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder:-, (b)  to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees  ISSUE \\\\\\\\u2013 III: If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15J of SEBI Act?  19. While determining the quantum of monetary penalty under Section 15 A (b) of SEBI Act, I have considered the factors stipulated in Section 15-J of SEBI Act, which reads as under:   Section 15J - Factors to be taken into account by the Adjudicating Officer    While  adjudging  quantum  of  penalty  under  section  15 - I,  the  Adjudicating  Officer  shall have due regard to the following factors, namely: (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever Adjudication Order in respect of Maxworth Investment Ltd., in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 8 of 9  quantifiable, made as a result of the default;  (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  20. The material made available on record has not quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee and the loss suffered by the investors as a result of the Noticee's default. There is also no material made available on record to assess the amount of loss caused to investors or the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee as a result of default. However, it is important to note that timely disclosure of information, as prescribed under the statute, is an important regulatory tool intended to serve a public purpose. Timely disclosures are also an essential part of the proper functioning of the securities market and failure to do so prevents investors from taking a well-informed investment decision.   21. Therefore, I am not inclined to view the lapse on the part of the Noticee leniently and consider it necessary to impose monetary penalty which would act as deterrent to the Noticee in future.   ORDER 22. Having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the SEBI Adjudication Rules, hereby impose a penalty of \\\\\\\\u20b92,00,000/- (Rupees Two lakhs only) on the Noticee i.e., Maxworth Investment Ltd., for violation of the provisions of Regulation 29 (2) read with Regulation 29 (3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011, under Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act.  23. The said penalty imposed on the Noticee, as mentioned above, is commensurate with the violation committed and acts as a deterrent factor for the Noticee and others in protecting the interest of investors. Adjudication Order in respect of Maxworth Investment Ltd., in the matter of Karuturi Global Ltd.,  Page 9 of 9  24. The Noticee shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days from the date of receipt of this Order, either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR through online payment facility available on the SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in on the following path by clicking on the payment link.

In terms of above referred directions of Whole Time Member of SEBI ((hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cWTM\\\\\\\\u201d), the Noticee company was required to take urgent steps to resolve the complaints pending for resolution/redressal  and file a satisfaction report to SEBI within a period of 45 days from the date of this order i.e. February 20, 2020.   3. It is noted that, at the time of SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s order, 16 Complaints were pending. The Noticee failed to submit any updated reply in SCORES for the pending investor grievances within 45 days from the date of the order.   4. Meanwhile, as Noticee Company failed to submit updated Action Taken Report (\\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\xc4TR\\\\\\\\u201d) within 45 days from the date of the order, Bombay Stock Exchange was advised to follow-up with the Noticee Company for resolution, but the Noticee Company failed to resolve the complaints.  5. The complaints pending against the company were perused again and on perusal of the complaints, it was found that, out of 16 complaints, 2 were duplicate complaints and 1 complaint was pertaining to bonus issue, where company has never issued bonus. So effectively, out of 16 complaints, 13 complaints were pending as on July 27, 2020 against the Noticee Company for which no ATR was submitted by it.  6. In view of the non-compliance of SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s WTM order by Noticee, SEBI has initiated adjudication proceedings against the Noticee under the provisions of Section 15HB of the SEBI Act.  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER     7. SEBI has appointed the undersigned as Adjudicating Officer vide order dated August 24, 2020 under section 15 I of SEBI Act read with rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAdjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions of section 15HB of the SEBI Act, the alleged non-compliance by the Noticee.

A Show Cause Notice dated October 16, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to the Noticee in terms of Rule 4 of SEBI (Procedure for holding inquiry and imposing penalties) Rules, 1995 read with Section 15-I of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against it in terms of Rule 4 of SEBI Adjudication Rules and penalty should not be imposed under 15HB of SEBI Act for its alleged failure to comply with the directions issued by WTM vide order dated February 20, 2020.  9. Vide email dated October 26, 2020, Noticee filed reply to the SCN and inter-alia made the following submissions in its letter dated October 26, 2020(hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cletter\\\\\\\\u201d):  We were going perfectly in order to conclude within the stipulated time but due to the Covid-19 Pandemic which showed its effect worldwide and also halted India from 22.03.2020 onwards and everything remain standstill then after. Registered Office of our Company were remain closed till end of May 2020. Even after that when office were reopened we were working only at 30% of the workforce. It was a very challenging period for all of us. Meanwhile when things were getting back in control and we began to operate at our full work force we have taken up this matter (to resolve the SEBI Complaints) and took initiative by sending Letters on dated 25.08.2020 to all the complainants (Annexure-1) asking for their suitable date & time to arrive personally at our registered office address, to listen to them in detail and arrive at an amicable solution. The copies of POD Slip is attached for your reference. The same was brought into the knowledge of complainants by sending mails on the complainant\\\\\\\\u2019s mail id. Some turned up personally and some insisted to talk over phone only.   We were going through the process then only few of our employees got infected and tested positive. Mr. Karnik Pillai (Manager Corporate Affairs-who is also an authorized person for all these matters) tested positive on 19.09.2020 & Mr. Bhaumik Mehta (Accounts Assistant) was tested positive on dated 20.09.2020. Both remain home quarantine for about more than 20 days. Their Reports are attached as Annexure-2 for your kind reference. Since they remained in office with the other office employees before being tested positive, there aroused panic situation among the other employees. Though the other employees were tested negative but few developed symptoms as a result the lockdown time scenario haunted on us again. Not only this the Uncle of Mr Hitesh Patel (Brother of Mr Hitesh Patel\\\\\\\\u2019s father) also tested positive and demised in the recent past creating emotional breakdown among the promoter group. The Images are shared as an evidence of the incident (Annexure-3).  We decided to give a little break and got back on track but are operating at only 20% of the work force that too the employees are coming on alternate days to avoid uncertainty of spreading the virus. Both of our employees seemed recovered but not 100% fit so theyAdjudication Order in respect of Mishtann Foods Ltd. (formerly known as HICS Cements Ltd)                                          Page 4 of 9    also remain present to office on rotational basis. We are heavily affected by this and seek support from your end. Not only our operations are majorly disturbed but also we are keen to resolve the SEBI Complaints.   In between we have received the Show cause notice on dated 16.10.2020 in which we are told to justify the delay and state our actions to resolve all the complaints in 15 days time otherwise will be levied penalties.  In relation to your SCN dated 16.10.2020, kindly note that under the circumstances in which we are operating we are unable to justify our actions in this 15 days and hereby request to your good office, on the above mentioned reasons, not to initiate any inquiry against the Company in terms of Rule 4 of SEBI Adjudication Rules and not to levy any penalty under 15HB OF SEBI Act for the violations alleged to have been committed by the Noticee.   We, rather, request to your good office to provide us time period of 90 days and/or upto 31st Jan 2021 to resolve the same in this situation.  Further this time we assure you that we will, without any further delay, resolve all the complaints and if we cannot / unable to resolve the complaints by the end of above mentioned time period, you may directly pass the adjudication order on the completion of the above time or initiate an actions as you may deem fit.  Hoping with the above favor in this pandemic situation for the last time.     PERSONAL HEARING   10. In order to comply with the principles of natural justice, The Noticee was provided an opportunity of personal hearing through Webex due to ongoing pandemic as well as for Hearing at SEBI Head Office on November 06, 2020.  11.  Mr. Hiteshkumar Gaurishankar Patel- Managing Director of the Noticee, Ms. Sonu Jain- Practicing Company Secretary and Mr. Mihir Shah- Legal Advisor, the Authorised Representatives (ARs) of the Noticee appeared for hearing on the scheduled date and time through WebEx. ARs reiterated the submissions made by Noticee vide letter dated October 26, 2020 and also requested to grant the period of 90 days to resolve the pending complaint.   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS  12. I have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticee, its reply and the documents / evidence available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are :Adjudication Order in respect of Mishtann Foods Ltd. (formerly known as HICS Cements Ltd)                                          Page 5 of 9     a) Whether the Noticee had failed to comply with the directions issued by the Whole Time Member of SEBI vide order dated February 20, 2020?   b) Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act?   c)  If yes, what should be the quantum of penalty?   13. The first issue for consideration is whether the Noticee had failed to comply with the directions issued by the Whole Time Member of SEBI vide order dated February 20, 2020.  14. In the above referred SEBI order dated February 20, 2020, the Whole Time Member of SEBI had inter alia directed the Noticee :  a) The Noticee Company is warned to be careful in resolving the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 complaints within the time line as specified in the circulars issued by SEBI from time to time.   b) As regards the complaints still pending for resolution/redressal for which the Company has been reminded vide email dated February 17, 2020, the Noticee Company is directed to take urgent steps to resolve those pending complaints and file a satisfaction report to SEBI within a period of 45 days from the date of this order.   15. In view of the directions made in the order above, the Noticee, was required to take urgent steps in resolving/redressing pending investor complaints and submit ATR within 45 days from the date of the order. I note that there is no dispute with regard to the fact that Noticee has not complied with the directions made under the said order within the timeline. However, Noticee in its letter  has contended that,  We were going perfectly in order to conclude within the stipulated time but due to the Covid-19 Pandemic which showed its effect worldwide and also halted India from 22.03.2020 onwards and everything remain standstill then after.   16. I have also noted that, Noticee has stated in its letter that, Noticee has taken  initiative by sending Letters on 25.08.2020 to all the complainants in this regard. The letter Inter-alia mentions about arranging personal meeting at its registered address with complainants to arrive at an amicable solution.    17. It is worth mentioning that, the directions issued by the Whole Time Member of SEBI vide order dated February 20, 2020 mentions about taking urgent steps by Noticee in resolution/redressal of pending complaints, I note from documents available on recordAdjudication Order in respect of Mishtann Foods Ltd. (formerly known as HICS Cements Ltd)                                          Page 6 of 9    that, no urgent steps were taken by Noticee for resolution/redressal of pending complaints and only on August 25, 2020, i.e., after more than 6 months of passing of the order, Noticee issued letters to complainants with regard to their complaint.  18. I observe from the documents available on record that majority of the complaints mainly pertains to non-receipt of shares after conversion/endorsement/consolidation/splitting.  19. Further, Noticee has given reason that, delay is due to ongoing pandemic, however, it is noted that considerable amount of time was elapsed since the date of order before the lockdown started due to COVD 19 Pandemic. i.e., March 22, 2020 and Noticee has not provided any document /evidence proving that, it has taken urgent steps for the resolution /redressal of pending complaints after the date of order and it was only on August 25, 2020,that, Noticee has initiated steps by sending letters to investors in relation to their complaints.   20. It is further stated by the Noticee in its letter that, we have received the Show cause notice on dated 16.10.2020 in which we are told to justify the delay and state our actions to resolve all the complaints in 15 days time otherwise will be levied penalties. In this regard it is to be noted that, Noticee has misinterpreted the 14 days\\\\\\\\u2019 time provided in the SCN to the Noticee to submit its reply, if any to the SCN.   21. Noticee has requested the undersigned to grant 90 days and/or upto 31st Jan 2021 to resolve pending complaints. I am of the view that, Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s request is beyond the scope of the present adjudication proceedings. In fact, such act shows utter lack of seriousness on the part of Noticee for resolving the complaints despite the direction of WTM to take urgent steps in this regard much earlier.  It also may be noted that, the Proceedings under section 11B of SEBI Act, 1992 was initiated against Noticee for non \\\\\\\\u2013resolution of investor grievances and failure to obtain SCORES authentication. Although, it is evident from the order that, SCORES authentication was obtained by Noticee and the initial complaints were resolved basis which the 11b proceedings was initiated, however, substantial number of complaints were still pending for redressal on the part of the Noticee Company at the time of order, For which the said directions of redressal /resolution were issued by WTM vide order dated February 20, 2020.  22. It is pertinent to mention that SEBI vide its circular dated December 18, 2014(hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI  Circular\\\\\\\\u201d) had  inter-alia directed   that,  \\\\\\\\u201c all   listed   companies   and   SEBI   registered intermediaries shall review their investors grievances redressal mechanism so as to further  strengthen  it  and  correct  the  existing  shortcomings,  if  any.  The  listed companies  and  SEBI  registered  intermediaries  to  whom  complaints  are  forwarded through SCORES, shall take immediate efforts on receipt of a complaint,Adjudication Order in respect of Mishtann Foods Ltd. (formerly known as HICS Cements Ltd)                                          Page 7 of 9    for its resolution, within thirty days. The listed companies and SEBI registered intermediaries shall keep the complainant duly informed of the action taken thereon.\\\\\\\\u201d  23. In compliance of abovementioned SEBI Circular, I find it is obligatory on the part of the Noticee being a listed company to take immediate efforts on receipt of a complaint, for its resolution within 30 days. However, from the facts available on record, it is observed that the Noticee has repeatedly failed to comply with the same. The leisure approach of the Noticee shows that it has never intended to comply with the direction of the statutory authorities.   24. Therefore, in view of the above I conclude that, the charge of the non-compliance of the directions issued vide order dated February 20, 2020 passed by Whole Time Member of SEBI against the Noticees stands established. The aforesaid non compliance by the Noticee attracts monetary penalty under Section 15 HB of SEBI Act, which reads as follows:   Section 15HB of SEBI Act.  Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided. \\\\\\\\u201c15HB. Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees.\\\\\\\\u201d  25. While determining the quantum of penalty under section 15 HB of the SEBI Act, it is important to consider the factors relevantly as stipulated in section  15J of the SEBI Act which read as under:-  Section  15J -Factors  to  be  taken  into  account  by  the  adjudicating  officer   While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:- (a)  the  amount  of  disproportionate  gain  or  unfair  advantage,  wherever  quantifiable, made as a result of the default;  (b)  the  amount  of  loss  caused  to  an  investor  or  group  of  investors  as  a  result  of  the default;  (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  26. Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of Chairman, SEBI vs. Shriram Mutual Fund {[2006] 5 SCC 361} held that \"In our view, the penalty is attracted as soon asAdjudication Order in respect of Mishtann Foods Ltd. (formerly known as HICS Cements Ltd)                                          Page 8 of 9    contravention of the statutory obligations as contemplated by the Act is established and, therefore, the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes immaterial. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. Hence, we are of the view that once the contravention is established, then the penalty has to follow and only the quantum of penalty is discretionary.\"  27. On the basis of the material available on record, it is not possible to quantify, exact gain or unfair advantage accrued to the Noticee or the extent of loss suffered by the investors as a result of the non-compliance of aforesaid directions. The Noticee by failing to resolve the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 complaints within the time line and to take urgent steps to resolve those pending complaints and file a satisfaction report to SEBI within a period of 45 days from the date of order dated February 20, 2020 has blatantly violated the directions given by SEBI. Besides, non-adherence by Noticee to the regulatory requirement of resolving complaints of investors in time bound manner is found to be repetitive in nature. I am of the view that the entities violating the directions issued by SEBI seriously compromise the regulatory framework and such acts are detrimental to the interest of the investors in the securities market. The interest of the investors and the orderly development of the securities market requires that perpetrators of such activities should be suitably penalized. Such stark defiance displayed by the Noticee towards regulatory directions cannot be viewed lightly. The non-compliance of the Noticee with the SEBI directions have jeopardized the interests of the gullible investors. Therefore, the Noticee must be visited with imposition of appropriate penalty for such defiance displayed by it   towards the regulatory directions issued by SEBI.  ORDER  28. After taking into consideration the nature and gravity of the charges established and reply of Noticee as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, I in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under15 I of SEBI Act read  with Rule 5 of the AO Adjudication Rules, 2005, hereby impose a penalty of Rs. 15,00,000/ - (Rupees Fifteen Lakhs Only) on the Noticee namely Mishtann Foods Ltd.

The aforesaid Noticees were called upon vide the said SCN, to show cause as to why directions under section 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992, (including directions for disgorgement of illegal gains against Noticee No. 1 and Noticee No. 2), be not issued against them for the aforementioned alleged violations of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the PIT Regulations, 1992. The SCN issued to the Noticees, also contained the copies of documents that have been relied upon in the SCN.   3. The genesis of the SCN lies in the fact that SEBI had received certain complaints from NDTV on July 16, 2013 (1st complaint), December 27, 2013 (2nd complaint) and January 9, 2014 (3rd complaint), inter alia, alleging that one Mr. Sanjay Dutt and certain entities associated with him Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 3 Entities                                                                     Page 2 of 61  viz.

Pursuant to the receipt of the above noted complaints from NDTV, SEBI conducted an investigation into the suspected insider trading in the scrip of NDTV during the period of September 01, 2006 to June 30, 2008 (hereinafter referred to as \"Investigation Period\") in course of which the following facts and findings were observed:   (1) The equity shares of NDTV were listed on National Stock Exchange of India Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNSE\\\\\\\\u201d) and BSE Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBSE\\\\\\\\u201d).

Similar trend was also observed at BSE.   (2) During the relevant time, Mr. Vikramaditya Chandra was the Group Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Mr. Ishwari Prasad Bajpai was the Senior Advisor, Editorial and Projects and Mr. Saurav Banerjee was the Director Finance & Group Chief Financial Officer in NDTV.

The details of those price sensitive events and the respective periods of unpublished price sensitive information (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cUPSI\\\\\\\\u201d) as gathered from the disclosures made by the Company and furnished to SEBI in the course of investigation with regard to each of those PSI are depicted in the following table:  Table No. 1: Details of PSI(s)  PSI Start date of UPSI  Date & time when the PSI was disclosed on exchange website UPSI period PSI-1: Expansion of the company in areas beyond news to develop NDTV into a bouquet of channels with entertainment and lifestyle and initiate a major thrust in New Media including the internet.

Although the SCN mentions about this trade of 3250 shares elsewhere in the contents and also the said Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 3 Entities                                                                     Page 6 of 61  trade executed by Noticee No.1 figures in the trade details furnished to the Noticees in Annexures No. 10 and 11 of the SCN, the Table No. 3 referred to above has inadvertently excluded this trade of the Noticee No. 1. However, the undeniable fact remains in record that the Noticee has traded in an aggregate number of 5270 shares of NDTV during the existence of PSI-3.  (10) From an analysis of the details of trades executed by the Noticees as enumerated above and the ESOP allotments made to them, it appears that the Noticees were selling the shares which were allotted to them in ESOPs during the investigation period.  (11) The copies of the emails submitted by NDTV vide letter dated September 14, 2016 shows that the Noticees herein, amongst others, were actively involved in the internal deliberations including various email conversations that led to crystallization of PSI-3 and PSI-6. The particulars of the emails received by the Noticees pertaining to the relevant PSI(s) during the existence of which the Noticees executed their respective sales of NDTV shares, are indicated below:  Table No. 5: Details of the relevant communications  Noticee No. PSI Date of email  Subject of the Email Contents of the Email 1 PSI-3 November 22, 2006 Fw Presentation and Draft Term Sheet Confidentiality agreement between ComVentures and NDTV Re Presentation and Draft Term Sheet Conversation with Keyur on NDA PSI-6 September 07, 2007 News Re Organization KPMG Checklist - Information requirements Checklist from KPMG on reorg 2 PSI-3 December 12, 2006 Re ComVentures Term Sheet Discussion on term sheet 3 PSI-6 September 07, 2007 News Re Organization KPMG Checklist - Information requirements Checklist from KPMG on reorg  (12) Noticees No. 1 and 2 were found to be involved in the process of crystallization of PSI-3 and had direct access to UPSI pertaining to PSI-3. Further, Noticees No. 1 and 3 were found to be involved in the process of crystallization of PSI-6 hence had direct access to UPSI pertaining to PSI-3. Therefore, the Noticees are alleged to be \\\\\\\\u201cinsiders\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of regulation 2(e) (ii) of PIT Regulations, 1992.   (13) In view of the fact that the Noticees were \\\\\\\\u201cinsiders\\\\\\\\u201d with respect to NDTV in terms of regulation 2(e) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 all the surrounding events and most notably Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 3 Entities                                                                     Page 7 of 61  the act of the Noticees having traded in NDTV shares during UPSI period suggest that the Noticees have dealt in securities of NDTV while in possession of UPSI.  (14) Regulation 3(i) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 amongst others, prohibits an insider, either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, from dealing in securities of a company listed on any stock exchange when he is in possession of any UPSI. In terms of regulation 4 of the PIT Regulations, 1992 any insider who deals in securities in contravention of regulation 3 of the PIT Regulations, 1992 is said to be guilty of insider trading.  (15) It was, therefore, observed that the Noticees, by dealing in securities of NDTV while in possession of unpublished price sensitive information of the Company, have apparently violated the provisions of section 12A(d) and (e) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulation 3(i) and regulation 4 of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  Calculation of wrongful gains:  (16) Since the Noticees have traded while in possession of UPSI, the wrongful gains made by them have been calculated as follows:  Table No. 6: The wrongful gains made by the Noticees  @ Note: Wrongful gain has been calculated as per the following method: Wrongful gain = (Average Sell Price - Opening Price on UPSI period starting day) X Net sell quantity during UPSI period  (17) Based on the above stated computation, it has been alleged that the total amount of wrongful gains made by the Noticee No. 1 and Noticee No. 2 is \\\\\\\\u20b96.67 lakhs and \\\\\\\\u20b98.82 lakhs, respectively while Noticee No. 3 incurred a loss of \\\\\\\\u20b90.47 lakhs.  4. I note that based on the findings of investigation, as briefly highlighted above, SEBI issued the instant SCN dated August 31, 2018, alleging, inter alia, that: Name UPSI period pertaining to Sell Quantity Average Sell Price (\\\\\\\\u20b9) based on actuals Opening Price on UPSI period starting day at NSE (\\\\\\\\u20b9)  Wrongful gain (\\\\\\\\u20b9) @ A B C D = A x (B - C) Vikramaditya Chandra PSI-3 5750 328.49 242.00    497,298.85  PSI-6 16000 395.63 385.00    170,086.55  Vikramaditya Chandra Total 21750 - - 667385.40 Ishwari Bajpai PSI-3 10000 330.28 242.00    882,779.80  Ishwari Bajpai Total 10000 - - 882,779.80 Banerjee Saurav PSI-6 2000 361.50 385.00   (47,000.00) Saurav  Banerjee Total 2000 361.50  (47,000.00) Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 3 Entities                                                                     Page 8 of 61   (1) The Noticees No. 1 and 2 were involved in the process of crystallization of PSI-3 and had direct access to the UPSI pertaining to PSI-3.  (2) The Noticees No. 1 and 3 were involved in the process of crystallization of PSI-6 and had direct access to the UPSI pertaining to PSI-3.  (3) All the Noticees clearly fall within the ambit of the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d with respect to NDTV in terms of regulation 2(e) of the PIT Regulations, 1992. (4) All the above-stated six (6) disclosures made by NDTV to the stock exchanges during the Investigation Period are deemed to be price sensitive information in terms of regulation 2(ha) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 and consequently, if such PSI was published, it was likely to have materially affected the price of securities of NDTV. (5) The Noticees, by dealing in securities of NDTV (a company listed on NSE and BSE) while in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, have violated the provisions of section 12A (d), (e) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulation 3(i) and regulation 4 of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  5. In view of the aforesaid findings, in the SCN the Noticees were advised to show cause as to why suitable directions under section 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 be not issued against them for the aforementioned alleged violations of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the PIT Regulations, 1992. The Noticees No. 1 and 2 were additionally advised to show cause as to why direction for disgorgement of illegal gains earned by them be not issued against them for the aforementioned alleged violations of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the PIT Regulations, 1992.  The Noticees were also advised to submit their reply, if any, within 21 days of the receipt of the SCN failing which it would be construed that the Noticees have no reply to submit and SEBI would be free to take action against them on the basis of materials available on record in terms of the SEBI Act, 1992 and other laws as applicable.  6. It is worth mentioning here that the PIT Regulations, 1992 have been repealed by the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015. Regulation 12 of the Regulations, 2015, provides as under:   \\\\\\\\u201cRepeal and Savings. 12.(1) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 are hereby repealed.   (2) Notwithstanding such repeal, \\\\\\\\u2014   (a) the previous operation of the repealed regulations or anything duly done or suffered thereunder, any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the repealed regulations, any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against the repealed regulations, or any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 3 Entities                                                                     Page 9 of 61  such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid, shall remain unaffected as if the repealed regulations had never been repealed;   (b) anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken including any adjudication, enquiry or investigation commenced or show-cause notice issued under the repealed regulations prior to such repeal, shall be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of these regulations;   (3) After the repeal of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992, any reference thereto in any other regulations made, guidelines or circulars issued thereunder by the Board shall be deemed to be a reference to the corresponding provisions of these regulations.\\\\\\\\u201d  7. As a result, any proceedings initiated for alleged contraventions of provisions of the PIT Regulations, 1992 are saved and, hence, can be proceeded with under the said PIT Regulations, 1992. Considering the foregoing, the instant proceedings initiated against the Noticees for their alleged violations of provisions of the PIT Regulations, 1992 can very well be continued as such.  8. I note from the SCN that the Noticees herein are not connected to each other and the only commonality noticed amongst them is that they were in the employment of the Company during the relevant period and are alleged to have been in possession of the relevant PSI(s) before they were published/disclosed by the Company to the Stock Exchanges. Thus each of the Noticees is unique in himself hence, has submitted separate written replies and submissions independent of the other Noticees. However, I note that the Noticee No. 3 (Saurav Banerjee) has raised various preliminary objections to the validity of the SCN and has advanced certain other explanations commonly with Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy who are also noticees before me in another SCN on the same issue for their alleged insider trading in the scrip of NDTV. Since I have already dealt with those common objections and arguments in my order passed in case of Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy being issued simultaneously today with this Order, for the sake of brevity, I would rather desist myself from discussing all  over again, those common objections/ arguments taken by Noticee No. 3 in this proceedings and instead would like to rely upon and adopt the discussions and observations  already made by me on those common points/objections in the order referred to above,  also with respect to the  Noticee No. 3. Therefore, instead of resorting to an ad verbatim reproduction of those preliminary objections raised by the Noticees No. 3 commonly with Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy, I would endeavor to discuss the main highlights of the explanations offered by the said Noticee No. 3 during the proceedings before me. Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 3 Entities                                                                     Page 10 of 61  9. I note that all the three Noticees herein have filed their separate written replies in the matter, the details of which are as under:  Table No. 7: Details of Replies Filed by the Noticees  Sl. No.  Noticee Date of reply 1.  Mr. Vikramaditya Chandra 20/12/2018 10/10/2019 09/11/2020 2.  Mr. Ishwari Prasad Bajpai 21/12/2018 10/11/2020 3.  Mr. Saurav Banerjee 31/07/2019 03/01/2020 11/03/2020 09/11/2020  10. Further, some of these Noticees had sought inspection of the relevant original documents.  Accordingly, in compliance with principles of natural justice, these Noticees were granted opportunity of inspection of those documents that have been relied upon in the SCN on October 30, 2018. Additionally, the Noticee No. 3 was afforded one more opportunity of inspection on September 27, 2019 as well. The Noticees were also granted opportunity of personal hearing before me on various dates as indicated in the table given below:  Table No. 8: Details of Personal Hearing  Sl. No. Noticee Name Date of Personal Hearing 1.  Vikramaditya Chandra 26/09/2019 2.  Ishwari Prasad Bajpai 26/09/2019 3.  Saurav Banerjee 10/07/2019 26/09/2019 13/12/2019 03/01/2020 08/01/2020   11. The Noticees appeared before me through their respective authorized representatives on the afore-stated dates and all of them were heard at length. I have perused the written replies and submissions of the Noticees filed before me in response to the SCN. Considering that these replies are quite voluminous and on many issues repetitive in nature and also include a number of case citations, my endeavor would be to summarize their submissions and to present hereunder the highlights of their averments for the sake of brevity and ease of dealing with all of their submissions. Further, I find that a substantial portions of the replies filed by the Noticees have proceeded on similar lines raising various common issues and objections. It will be appropriate therefore to segregate the common replies from specific replies of each of the Noticees. Accordingly, the replies and submissions made by each of the Noticees are discussed as under: Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 3 Entities                                                                     Page 11 of 61   A. Noticee No. 1 -   (1) During the time of executing the relevant trades, the Noticee was an employee of NDTV. In course of the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s employment with NDTV, and as a result of his commitment and performance in the organization, he was granted ESOPs, in the normal course, and had been vested with 75,000 stock options under the NDTV Employee Stock Option Plan - ESOP 2004. All the relevant trades executed by the Noticee were sale transactions, and were undertaken to legitimately monetize the ESOPs granted to him.  (2) The ComVentures transaction (PSI-3) pertains to an investment of USD 20 million by ComVentures, a venture capital fund, in NDTV's subsidiary NDTV Networks Plc UK, for the purpose of funding its non-news businesses.  (3) NDTV's letter dated October 12, 2015 (\"NDTV October Letter\"), enclosed as Annexure 10 to the SCN, stated that preliminary discussions around this proposal were initiated within NDTV in January, 2007. That said, in its letter dated September 14, 2016, enclosed as Annexure 6 to the SCN, NDTV stated that the negotiations and discussions had started on November 22, 2006. Therefore, it is abundantly clear that the discussions around this time were purely exploratory.   (4) Subsequently, and after multiple rounds of negotiations between the parties, a non-binding term sheet was executed between ComVentures and NDTV, as an expression of interest, which did not create a legal relationship or a binding agreement between the parties. Consequently, NDTV issued a stock exchange announcement on March 12, 2007, wherein it was stated that NDTV had entered into a definitive agreement with ComVentures.  (5) Based on the information provided in the SCN and the annexures enclosed thereto, a chronology of events involving Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s transactions in NDTV share during the existence of PSI-3 is set out as below:  Table No. 9: Chronology of events involving Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s transactions in NDTV share during the existence of PSI-3  Date and Time of Event / Correspondence Nature of Event/ Correspondence 22/11/2006; 05:45 Email correspondence between representatives of NDTV and ComVentures, as applicable, in relation to the ComVenture Transaction 22/11/2006; 06:03 24/11/2006; 15:38 28/11/2006; 08:05 28/11/2006; 10:57 09/12/2006; 10:42 Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 3 Entities                                                                     Page 12 of 61  12/12/2006; 11:34 14/12/2006; 08:03 28/12/2006; 04:20 07/01/2007; 17:56 19/01/2007; 17:59 19/02/2007 Sale of 2,500 shares in the NDTV scrip by the Noticee 28/02/2007; 12:55 Email correspondence between representatives of NDTV and ComVentures, as applicable, in relation to the ComVenture Transaction 02/03/2007; 09:10 10/03/2007; 12:08 12/03/2007; 15:50 12/03/2007 Stock exchange announcement by NDTV 31/08/2018 Issuance of the SCN  (6) The proposed business reorganization pertains to NDTV's decision to evaluate options for reorganization of NDTV with the objective of unlocking shareholder value and to promote focused growth of its various businesses, including demerger/split into news related businesses and investments in 'beyond news' businesses (PSI-6).   (7) In this regard, and as stated in the NDTV October Letter, this was a subject of preliminary discussions among certain persons within NDTV and there was no date identified therein to suggest on which the discussions pertaining to the proposed reorganization were started. It was much later that NDTV issued a stock exchange announcement on April 16, 2008, wherein it was stated that the board of NDTV had decided to evaluate options for the reorganization, including demerger/split of NDTV and for this purpose, a committee had been constituted to evaluate such options.   (8) Based on the information provided in the SCN and the annexures enclosed thereto, a chronology of events surrounding the Noticees transactions in NDTV shares during the existence of PSI-6 is set out below:  Table No. 10: Chronology of events surrounding the Noticees transactions in NDTV shares during the existence of PSI-6  Date and Time of Event / Correspondence Nature of Event/ Correspondence/Transaction  07/09/2007; 20:12 Internal email correspondence between NDTV representatives, as applicable, in relation to the proposed reorganization 12/11/2007; 18:23 20/11/2007 Sale of 3,000 NDTV shares by the Noticee 23/01/2008 Sale of 2,000 NDTV shares by the Noticee 28/01/2008 Sale of 1,500 NDTV shares by the Noticee 11/02/2008 Sale of 3,000 NDTV shares by the Noticee 12/02/2008 Sale of 3,000 NDTV shares by the Noticee 10/03/2020 Sale of 2,000 NDTV shares by the Noticee 11/03/2008 Sale of 1,000 NDTV shares by the Noticee Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 3 Entities                                                                     Page 13 of 61  17/03/2008 Sale of 500 NDTV shares by the Noticee 12/04/2008; 12:43   15/04/2008; 16:55 Internal email correspondence between NDTV representatives, as applicable, in relation to the proposed reorganization 17/04/2008; 18:26 16/04/2008 Stock exchange announcement by NDTV 28/04/2008; 18:26 Internal email correspondence between NDTV representatives, as applicable, in relation to the proposed reorganization 31/08/2018 Issuance of the SCN  (9) Prevailing market conditions during 2006-2008 - During the time of relevant trades, i.e., in 2006-2008, the conditions of the Indian securities market were very volatile. As mentioned in the Annual Reports issued by SEBI during 2006-2008, India was the third most volatile market in the world. In such market situations, based on the advice of his financial advisors to diversify/reallocate the assets to mitigate the risk, the Noticee decided to undertake the relevant trades by selling the shares of NDTV received through ESOPs.  (10) Delay in Initiating Proceedings -   (a) The allegation relates to the trades which were undertaken more than 10 years ago. The SCN is the first instance that any proceedings have been initiated against the Noticee since the time of and in connection with the relevant trades, and there is nothing on record to indicate the reason for the unexplained and unnatural delay in initiating the proceedings.   (b) The initiation of proceedings by SEBI after such a long delay, severely prejudices the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s ability to adequately respond to the SCN in the light of the dated nature of facts surrounding the relevant trades and the fact that the Noticee has ceased to be associated with NDTV or in its employment with effect from October, 2016.   (c) The Noticee does not have access to the underlying documents relating to the relevant trades and due to the passage of time and his resignation from NDTV, he is constrained from coherently recollecting the entire factual background of the transactions relating to the UPSI period.   (d) In this regard, it is an established judicial principle that wherever a power is vested in a statutory authority without prescribing any time-limit, such power should be exercised within a reasonable time1.                                                   1 Ram Chand vs Union of India (1994) SCC 44 Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 3 Entities                                                                     Page 14 of 61   (e) The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (\\\\\\\\u201cthe Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT\\\\\\\\u201d) has also taken note of this pri", "Date": "2020-11-27", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Order on the matter of New Delhi Television Limited - Mr. Vikramadiya Chandra, Mr. Ishwari Prasad Bajpai and Mr. Saurav Banerjee", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/nov-2020/order-on-the-matter-of-new-delhi-television-limited-mr-vikramadiya-chandra-mr-ishwari-prasad-bajpai-and-mr-saurav-banerjee_48312.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 57371, "unique_record_id": "bf4e60421dSEBI20201127", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "66805c8f785891030647129c", "parse_date": "2024-06-29 19:11:44", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Insider Trading", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "6,67,385.40  \n8,82,779.80  \n(47,000.00)", "gpt_audience": "- Investors and shareholders of New Delhi Television Limited (NDTV)\n- Employees and former employees of NDTV\n- Regulatory authorities such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\n- Legal professionals and compliance officers\n- Financial analysts and market researchers\n- Media and journalists covering financial and corporate news\n- Potential investors and stakeholders in NDTV\n- Corporate governance experts and consultants", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

The shareholding of the Noticees as PAC in Centum changed during the investigation period and, as PAC, they were required to make disclosures in terms of SAST Regulations on multiple occasions. SEBI further, observed that the transactions executed by Noticee 3 in the scrip of Centum, during the investigation period, required disclosures in terms of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulation, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \"PIT Regulations, 1992\") read with Regulation 12(2) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulation, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \"PIT Regulations, 2015\") on multiple occasions. However, it was observed that the Noticees have failed to make disclosures as PAC in terms of SAST Regulations and Noticee 3 failed to make disclosures in terms of PIT Regulations, 1992, as required. In view of the same, SEBI has initiated adjudication proceedings under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act against the Noticees.  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 3.

Another Show Cause Notice SEBI/EAD/BJD/MKG/16382/2020 dated October 01, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN 2\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee 3, under the AO Rules to show-cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against the Noticee 3 and why penalty should not be imposed upon it under Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act for the violations of PIT Regulations, 1992 alleged to have been committed by him.  7.

The company in its reply dated July 04, 2015, has provided details of disclosures received by the Noticee 3. However, it was observed that, there were various instances of purchase/ sell as given in the above table which triggered the disclosure requirement and yet, disclosures were not provided by the Noticee 3 to the Company.   d. In view of the above facts and observations, it is alleged that the Noticee 3 has violated Regulation 13(1) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992, on three (3) occasions and Regulation 13(3) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992, on three (3) occasions.  8. The SCN 1 issued to the Noticees was sent through digitally signed email dated October 01, 2020 and were duly delivered to the Noticees. The Noticee 1 vide letter dated October 12, 2020, replied to the SCN 1, on behalf of all the Noticees and inter alia made following submissions- i. At the outset, we would like to state that the shareholding is relating to 2011, 2012, 2013 & 2014. We are not in position to locate file containing to these disclosures as these records are 7-8 years old period. Moreover, it is humanly impossible to remember any specific reasons for non-submission in case even if not submitted.  ii. Notwithstanding what is stated above, we would like to submit followings a) Our shareholding is disclosed in quarterly shareholding pattern as displayed in Stock Exchange website and available to general public (Shareholding pattern period ended Dec-11 to Dec-14 highlighting our shareholding is attached as Annexure- 1). Thus, details of change of holding of the shares of the company were already on the public domain due to the corporate periodic filing made by the company with the stock exchange. b) It is also stated that no loss or harm was caused to any investor or shareholding of the company or any public in any manner. c) Not pecuniary gain and advantage was derived by us. d) We have not acted deliberately in defiance of the law. We have not acted in conscious disregard of our obligation.____________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Centum Electronics Limited                                        Page 7 of 22      iii. It is also stated that we have always acted in compliance of rules and regulations of security market. In view of non-location or non-availability of files containing disclosures, we are handicapped to submit required disclosures as matter is 7-8 years old. Needless to state that, our inability to submit disclosures cannot be termed as non-disclosures.  iv. We would like to draw your attention to many judgements which condemns such inordinate delay and have rules that investigation authority cannot draw adverse interference against that party for not producing records.  v. Having regards to what is stated above, you are requested to view the stated fact in right spirits and perceptive and not to take negative inference.  9. The SCN 2 issued to the Noticee 3 was sent through digitally signed email dated October 01, 2020 and was duly delivered to the Noticee 3. However, the Noticee 3 failed to file any reply to the SCN 2. Thereafter, in the interest of natural justice, all the Noticees including the Noticee 3, were granted opportunities of personal hearing through webex video conferencing on November 19, 2020, vide digitally signed email dated November 05, 2020. Aforesaid email was duly served upon the Noticees and didn\\\\\\\\u2019t bounce. However, the Noticees didn\\\\\\\\u2019t avail opportunity of personal hearing.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES 10. I have carefully perused the charges leveled against the Noticees, reply of the Noticees and the documents / material available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are: (a) Whether the Noticees, as PAC, have violated provisions of Regulations 29(1), 29(2) read with Regulation 29(3) of SAST Regulations on multiple occasions? (b) Whether the Noticee 3 has violated provisions of Regulations 13(1), 13(3) read with Regulation 13(5) of PIT Regulations,1992, on multiple occasions?____________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Centum Electronics Limited                                        Page 8 of 22      (c) Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act?  (d) If so, what would be the quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticees after taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act?  11. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the SAST Regulations and PIT Regulations, 1992 and PIT Regulations, 2015 as below: Relevant provisions of SAST Regulations: 2.(1).(q). \\\\\\\\u2018persons acting in concert\\\\\\\\u2019 means, \\\\\\\\u2014  (1) persons who, with a common objective or purpose of acquisition of shares or voting rights in, or exercising control over a target company, pursuant to an agreement or understanding, formal or informal, directly or indirectly co-operate for acquisition of shares or voting rights in, or exercise of control over the target company.

(2) Any person, who together with persons acting in concert with him, holds shares or voting rights entitling them to five per cent or more of the shares or voting rights in a target company, shall disclose the number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights, even if such change results in shareholding falling below five per cent, if there has been change in such holdings from the last disclosure made under sub-regulation (1) or under this sub-regulation; and such change exceeds two per cent of total shareholding or voting rights in the target company, in such form as may be specified.]  (3) The disclosures required under sub-regulation (1) and sub-regulation (2) shall be made within two working days of the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares, or the acquisition of shares or voting rights in the target company to,\\\\\\\\u2014  (a) every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed; and  (b) the target company at its registered office.  Relevant provisions of PIT Regulations, 1992: Disclosure of interest or holding in listed companies by certain persons - Initial Disclosure 13.

The first issue for consideration is whether the Noticees, as PAC, have violated the provisions of Regulations 29(1), 29(2) read with Regulation 29(3) of SAST Regulations on multiple occasions. It is noted from the disclosure dated March 23, 2013, under Regulation 29(1) of SAST Regulations, made to the Company, by the Noticee 1 to 4 and 6 that they were shown as PAC in the said disclosure. Additionally, it is noted from the Table 1 that the Noticee 1 is director in the Noticee 6, 7 and 8; the Noticee 2 is director in the Noticee 7; the Noticee 3, 4 & 5 are directors in the Noticee 6. Further, the Noticee 1, 2 & 4 are also common directors in Fidelity Multitrade Limited. It is noted that in terms of the Regulation 2(1)(q)(2)(ii) of SAST Regulations that a company, its directors and any person entrusted with the management of the company are deemed to be PAC. Thus, I find that the Noticees are deemed to be PAC in terms of SAST Regulations (herein after referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Bharat Patel PAC/ PAC\\\\\\\\u2019).  13. I note that Regulation 29(1) read with 29(3) of SAST Regulations clearly mandates that any acquirer who acquires shares or voting rights in a target company which taken together with shares or voting rights, if any, held by him and by persons acting in concert with him in such target company, aggregating to five per cent or more of the shares of such target company, shall disclose their aggregate shareholding to \\\\\\\\u2014 (a) every stock exchange where the shares of the Target____________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Centum Electronics Limited                                        Page 12 of 22      Company are listed; and (b) the Target Company at its registered office, within two working days, from the acquisition of the shares. Further, in terms of SAST Regulations, acquirer means any person who, directly or indirectly, acquires or agrees to acquire whether by himself, or through, or with persons acting in concert with him, shares of a target company. I note from the Table 2 that the total shareholding of the Noticees as PAC has changed during the investigation period as below: (i) On February 14, 2012, shareholding of Bharat Patel PAC increased from 3,77,842 shares (3.06% of total paid up share capital of Company) to 14,92,842 shares (12.07% of total paid up share capital of Company).  (ii) Thereafter, on January 29, 2013, shareholding of Bharat Patel PAC again increased from 5,35,551 shares (4.33% of total paid up share capital of Company) to 6,83,551 shares (5.53% of total paid up share capital of Company).   14. I, therefore, note from above that the Noticees as PAC were acquirers and on aforesaid two occasions their total shareholding crossed the threshold of 5% shares of the target company. Thus, they were required to make disclosures in terms of Regulation 29(1) read with 29(3) of SAST Regulations on two aforesaid occasions.  15. Further, In terms of Regulation 29(2) read with 29(3) of SAST Regulations, 2011, any acquirer, who together with persons acting in concert with him, holds shares or voting rights entitling them to five per cent or more of the shares or voting rights____________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Centum Electronics Limited                                        Page 13 of 22      in a target company, shall disclose every acquisition or disposal of shares of such target company representing two per cent or more of the shares or voting rights in such target company with in two working days of receipt of intimation of allotment of shares or acquisition of shares to the target company and Stock exchange. It is noted that total shareholding of the Noticees, as PAC, taken together reached 12.07% shares, in Centum on February 14, 2012. Subsequently, due to disposal / sale of shares on February 15, 2020 by the Noticees, their total shareholding in the Centum reduced by 5.81%. Therefore, the Noticees as PAC were required to make disclosure for aforesaid disposal of shares, in terms of Regulation 29(2) read with 29(3) of SAST Regulations. Similarly, I note from the Table 2 that the Noticees as PAC were required to make disclosures in terms of Regulation 29(2) read with 29(3) of SAST Regulations on seven (7) other occasions during the investigation period.  16. I note from the reply of the Noticees that they have not disputed the facts of the case. In this regard it is contended by the Noticees that they have acted in compliance of rules and regulations of securities market. However, I note that they have failed to submit any cogent evidence in this regard which will substantiate their submissions. It is further noted that Centum, vide letter dated July 04, 2015, has submitted that it has not received disclosures for aforesaid changes in the shareholding of the Noticees. The Noticees further submitted that their shareholding is disclosed in quarterly shareholding pattern displayed in stock exchange website and available in public domain. In this context, I would like to rely on observation of Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (\\\\\\\\u2018SAT\\\\\\\\u2019) in Ambaji Papers Pvt. Ltd. vs. the Adjudicating Officer, SEBI dated January 15, 2014,____________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Centum Electronics Limited                                        Page 14 of 22      wherein similar contention of information being in the public domain was raised by the appellant. Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT observed: \".... that a reading of Regulation 7 of the SAST Regulations, 1997 read with Regulation 35(2) of the SAST Regulations, 2011 clearly points out that not only the company, but an acquirer is also required to inform the stock exchanges at every stage of aggregate of the shareholding or voting rights in the company. The object underlying these regulations is, therefore, unequivocally to bring more transparency by dissemination of complete information to the public as well as shareholders at large not only by the concerned company but by the individual acquirer as well.\"  17. I would also like to rely on observation of Hon'ble SAT in Premchand Shah and Others V. SEBI (Appeal no. 192 of 2010 dated February 21, 2011), wherein it was held that - \"\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.When a law prescribes a manner in which a thing is to be done, it must be done only in that manner.\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026 Non-disclosure of information in the prescribed manner deprived the investing public of the information which is required to be available with them when they take informed decision while making investments \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026 \"  18. The Noticees have further contended that they have not gained any pecuniary gain or advantage by not making the purported disclosures, no loss was caused to the investors. The Noticees also submitted that they have not acted deliberately in defiance of law. In this regard, I note that Hon'ble SAT through various judgments has consistently observed that these factors are not valid grounds for not complying with the mandatory disclosure obligations under the PIT and SAST regulations. In the matter of Virendrakumar Jayantilal Patel vs. SEBI (Appeal No.____________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Centum Electronics Limited                                        Page 15 of 22      299 of 2014 order dated October 14, 2014), Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT observed that - \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. obligation to make disclosures within the stipulated time is a mandatory obligation and penalty is imposed for not complying with the mandatory obligation. Similarly argument that the failure to make disclosures within the stipulated time, was unintentional, technical or inadvertent and that no gain or unfair advantage has accrued to the appellant, is also without any merit, because, all these factors are mitigating factors and these factors do not obliterate the obligation to make disclosures.\\\\\\\\u201d  19. I also note that in Appeal No. 78 of 2014 of Akriti Global Traders Ltd. Vs. SEBI, the Hon'ble SAT vide Order dated September 30, 2014 had observed that - \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026..Argument of appellant that the delay was unintentional and that the appellant has not gained from such delay and therefore penalty ought not to have been imposed is without any merit, because, firstly, penal liability arises as soon as provisions under the regulations are violated and that penal liability is neither dependent upon intention of parties nor gains accrued from such delay.\\\\\\\\u201d Therefore, I find that the contentions of the Noticees are devoid of any merit.  20. In view of the above, I find that the allegation of non-submission of disclosures in terms of Regulation 29(1) and 29(2) read with 29(3) of SAST Regulations, as brought out above, against the Noticees, as PAC, stands established.   21. The next issue for consideration is whether Noticee 3 has violated provisions of Regulation 13(1), 13(3) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992 on multiple____________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Centum Electronics Limited                                        Page 16 of 22      occasions. It is noted that in terms of Regulation 13(1) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992, any person who holds more than 5% shares in any listed company shall disclose to the Company details of his shareholding in the Company, within 2 working days of on becoming such holder. I note from Table 3 that the Noticee 3 acquired 11,15,000 shares (9.02% of paid up share capital of the Company) on February 14, 2020 and, as a result, his shareholding increased from 25,202 shares (0.20% of paid up share capital of the Company) to 11,40,202 shares (9.22% of paid up share capital of the Company), triggering disclosure requirement in terms of Regulation 13(1) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992. Similarly, on two (2) other occasions i.e. on March 04, 2013 and June 17, 2014 his shareholding again crossed 5% in the Company. Thus, the Noticee 3 was required to make disclosures in terms of Regulation 13(1) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992 on three (3) abovementioned occasions.  22. In terms of Regulation 13(3) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992, any person who holds more than 5% shares in any listed company and his shareholding changes by more than 2%, he shall disclose to the Company details of his shareholding and changes therein, within 2 working days of such change.

Hence the funds are mis-utilized to the extent of Rs. 1.79 crore (79 clients) on January 10, 2018 and Rs. 0.91 crore (212 clients) on June 7, 2018. Therefore, SEBI inspection team found that the Noticee had misused pledging client\\\\\\\\u2019s securities in excess of client\\\\\\\\u2019s obligation.

The said hearing was conducted through videoconferencing on the Webex platform in view of the difficulties faced due to Covid-19 pandemic. The Authorised Representative of the Noticee availed the opportunity of personal hearing and sought 5 days\\\\\\\\u2019 time to make additional submissions. The Noticee vide its emails dated November 09, 2020, submitted additional submissions.  7. The submissions made by the Noticee in its aforesaid replies are summarized below:  \\\\\\\\u201cAt the outset we and without prejudice to anything herein stated, we deny that we have committed violations to invoke holding inquiry and impose penalties as alleged. Nothing stated in the SCN should be deemed to have been admitted and / or inferred to have been admitted by us, save and except to the extent expressly admitted herein. The SEBI inspection was concluded at our office from October 1, 2018 to October 5, 2018. However, no discussion was held by the inspection team with us for any observations raised by them. Further, even after the conclusion of the inspection, there were no preliminary observations sent to us wherein explanations could have been submitted by us subsequent to which an observation sheet was send by the inspection team on 3rd April, 2019. This is against principles of natural justice. Even it seems from the show cause notice that the reply submitted by us vide our submissions dated 26th April, 2019 have not being considered and taken on record since the show cause notice states that \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u2019s submission was not accepted by the SEBI inspection team\\\\\\\\u201d.  This is an unilateral observation without recourse to us Surprisingly, even the Exchanges who have raised the observations Adjudication Order in respect of Prudent Broking Services Private Limited    Page 10 of 59      have failed to consider the reconciliation and explanations submitted. We submit that during the course of carrying on business transactions, dealing with the clients, and implementing any circulars there may be certain lapses at the initial teething level, when compliance take time for implementation, but that cannot be translated to non compliance.  In view thereof we plead that a lenient view may be taken and without holding inquiry and penal procedures.   We now deal with our point wise submission herein under: 1. Mis-utilization of client\\\\\\\\u2019s funds and securities: (A) We state and submit that we take utmost care to ensure client funds are segregated and the fund flow is as per the prescribed norms and circulars. It is submitted that the obligation of clients is met through client funds itself, which is maintained separately by us.  We submit that we have never misused client funds. We submit that \"misuse of funds\" is a very strong allegation. We submit that at best there has been temporary mismatch of balance in \\\\\\\\u201cclient ledger\" with balance in \"client bank account\". These were principally due to administrative oversight rather than a malafide intention on our part, which SEBI inspection report seems to suggest but have not placed any evidence to prove the same. It is pertinent to note that during the period of inspection, there were no software driven alerts as they were incorporated in the system much later after the said inspection period and pursuant to issuance of Enhanced Risk Based Supervision Circular no SEBI/HO/MIRSD2/CIR/P/ 2016/95 dated 26.09.2016. It may be appreciated that there were many practical hardship at the initial phase of implementation of the said circular.  We reiterate that the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds have never been misappropriated by us and none of the clients have made any allegations against us for non-payment of dues.  We draw your attention to the fact that Exchange billing times and processing the same at back office takes a lot of time after the market closure timings. Only after the billings and other  connected back office diligence and support is carried out that we come to know how much funds should have been kept as balance in the client bank account against the client credit so that there does not remain funds of credit balance clients utilized for settlement of debit clients or for own use. However, while Adjudication Order in respect of Prudent Broking Services Private Limited    Page 11 of 59      the circular was implemented there were no banking provisions to maintain the funds balance in client bank account by late evening. It was only after 16th December, 2019, RBI extended the timing of NEFT to 24 hours which were further subject to respective banks regulations. So earlier it was very difficult to harmonize with such Regulatory circular in lack of infrastructure available from other Regulators. That initially SEBI has implemented the initial enhance supervision reporting on monthly basis. It was later implemented on weekly basis. However, the inspection team has verified the day other than the reporting day, which was even not mentioned in the SEBI circular on Enhanced Risk Based Supervision vide Circular no SEBI/HO/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated 26.09.2016. So practically, we have not violated any of the clauses including clause 3 of the said circular.  At the further outset and without prejudice to anything else herein stated, we offer our comments to the said SCN submitting that while SEBI seeks to apply Enhanced Risk based Formula to determine extent of mis-utilization in the subject SCN, we are anguished that by the same formula, we have not been given due credit of non-funded portion of bank guarantee which forms part of Enhance Risk Formula. Even the Bankers does not issue the non-funded portion of the bank guarantee without making credit evaluation of the member broker and its promoters. Depositing the bank guarantee Exchange is fully secured upto the amount of the bank guarantee issued by the bank. However, the said fact was not considered while framing the enhanced supervision circular.  Further we would like to we humbly submit that although the said circular came into effect much later in time, the provision of mis-utilizaiton of clients funds were implemented by SEBI long back. We state that the said circular has highlighted and suggested mode of calculation of client funds. Therefore, we most humbly pray that irregularities, if any, may be viewed leniently since they were venial, technical and administrative lapse and not to evade compliance or in defiance of law. We request that you consider the intent to comply rather than procedural lapse which may be due to lack of adequate checks available at that point of time. (B) We further draw your attention to the enclosure 2 of our submission made dated 26th April, 2019 wherein for the sample dated selected by the inspection team we Adjudication Order in respect of Prudent Broking Services Private Limited    Page 12 of 59      have worked out working as per point I and J as mentioned in para 3.3.3. of the SEBI circular on Enhanced Risk Based Supervision vide Circular no SEBI/HO/MIRSD2/CIR/P/ 2016/95 dated 26.09.2016. At no instances, funds of clients used for margin obligation of proprietary trading and funds of credit balance clients used for margin obligation of debit balance clients and proprietary trading. The said enclosure 2 is once again attached herewith as enclosure \\\\\\\\u2013 1. (C) There was no observation with respect to mis-utilization of securities and hence the observation/ allegation is not applicable.  2. Non segregation of client\\\\\\\\u2019s funds and securities: (A) With respect to non-segregation of client\\\\\\\\u2019s funds, we refer to clause 1 of the SEBI circular SMD/SE/CIR/93/23321 dated November, 18, 1993 relating to Regulations of transactions between clients and brokers, wherein it has been mentioned that: \\\\\\\\u201cIt shall be compulsory for all Member brokers to keep the money of the clients in a separate account and their own money in a separate account. No payment for transactions in which the Member broker is taking a position as a principal will be allowed to be made from the client\\\\\\\\u2019s account.\\\\\\\\u201d During the period of inspection, there were no instances found where client\\\\\\\\u2019s funds were deposited in own account or own funds have been deposited in client bank account.  The observation regarding dividend received on behalf of client is routed through own bank account, we would like to submit that since the bank account linked with the client margin demat account was own account. Therefore, the dividend received was in own bank account. However, credit thereof is given to client ledger and payment against the same is done from client bank account only. Enclosure- 2  SEBI circular SMD/SE/CIR/93/23321 dated November, 18, 1993 relating to Regulations of transactions between clients and brokers, it has been mentioned that: \\\\\\\\u201cIt shall be compulsory for all Member brokers to keep the money of the clients in a separate account and their own money in a separate account. No payment for transactions in which the Member broker is taking a position as a principal will be allowed to be made from the client\\\\\\\\u2019s account.\\\\\\\\u201d Adjudication Order in respect of Prudent Broking Services Private Limited    Page 13 of 59      \\\\\\\\u201cEvery member broker who holds or receives money on account of a client shall forthwith pay such money to current or deposit account at bank to be kept in the name of the member in the title of which the word \"clients\" shall appear (hereinafter referred to as \"clients account\")\\\\\\\\u201d We have given credit of the dividend received in client ledger and payment for the same has been made from client bank account only. In view thereof adequate segregation of funds have been dealt with.  (B) Since there was no observation with respect to non-segregation of securities, the said observation stands settled and accepted.    3. Money received from pledging client\\\\\\\\u2019s securities are routed through own bank account It has been alleged that money received from pledging client\\\\\\\\u2019s securities are routed through own bank account. Further, it is stated that \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee has admitted before the inspection team that it has received fund by pledging of client in own bank account. Therefore, Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s submission was not accepted by the SEBI inspection team.\\\\\\\\u201d In respect to the above, we does not deny of having funds received in own bank account. The said rule of availing facility in client bank account was introduced by the SEBI circular on Enhanced Risk Based Supervision vide Circular no SEBI/HO/MIRSD2/CIR/P/ 2016/95 dated 26.09.2016. The facility which we have availed from the bank was sanctioned long back before the issuance of the said circular. At that time banks used to fund the proprietary account only. The same was revised subsequent to issue of the circular and said observation by the inspection team.   However, due to the above it cannot be concluded that we have mis-utilized funds. We have submitted a reconciliation of the receipt of funds in own account and thereafter the same has been transferred to the client bank account. No comments from the inspection team has been received on the same. We would like to submit that our working and reconciliation remain to be considered. . Even the bank account transactions have day to day reconciliation effects. Considering the same, is submitted that there is no case of mis-utilization. Adjudication Order in respect of Prudent Broking Services Private Limited    Page 14 of 59      Further, we draw attention to the important fact that show cause notice has been issued for mis-utilization / non-segregation of funds. However, in the inspection findings, the observation was only on non-segregation of funds. The applicable provision mentioned therein was SEBI circular SMD/SE/CIR/93/23321 dated November, 18, 1993 relating to Regulations of transactions between clients and brokers, it has been mentioned that: \\\\\\\\u201cIt shall be compulsory for all Member brokers to keep the money of the clients in a separate account and their own money in a separate account. No payment for transactions in which the Member broker is taking a position as a principal will be allowed to be made from the client\\\\\\\\u2019s account.\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u201cEvery member broker who holds or receives money on account of a client shall forthwith pay such money to current or deposit account at bank to be kept in the name of the member in the title of which the word \"clients\" shall appear (hereinafter referred to as \"clients account\")\\\\\\\\u201d It is submitted that money which we received in own account was deposited in client account. Working for the same was attached as enclosure \\\\\\\\u2013 4 vide submission made dated 26th April, 2019 which has not been taken on record. The same is attached herewith as enclosure - 3 for your ready reference.   4. Misuse of client\\\\\\\\u2019s funds and securities: It has been alleged that we have pledged client\\\\\\\\u2019s securities (for both debit and credit clients) in excess of client\\\\\\\\u2019s obligation and /or client\\\\\\\\u2019s obligation being more than the proportionate amount of funds raised against respective clients pledged shares.  We deny the above observation. As the inspection team has checked the working as per the inspection working format. However, inspection team failed to consider the post working action taken by the Member. We have based on the said request have got shares released from the NBFCs where the shares were pledged. As a part of NBFC companies policy if any request given to them before 2.00 PM, the said request for release is processed on the same day. In case, the release request is delayed from the said timeline deadline, the release of shares were made on the next day as per general practice. Considering the said release of stocks on the next day, there does not remains and mis-utilization. It is on account of practical hardship Adjudication Order in respect of Prudent Broking Services Private Limited    Page 15 of 59      that processing does not happens 24 hours, the reconciliation gap is there. We further submit that earlier we use to maintain books of accounts on T day billing. Therefore, such reconciliation use to take place. However, no the books of accounts are maintained on T+1 basis in Future and Options segment and T+2 basis on cash market segment. So due to now change in billing cycle we get time to release the stock well in advance before billing.  Documents for the request given for the unpledging the shares, stock received in the demat account on next day and release confirmation from NBFCs and calculations thereof etc has been attached as Enclosure \\\\\\\\u2013 4, Enclosure 5, Enclosure 6. The demat statements of account which are enclosed as Enclosure \\\\\\\\u2013 4 are being sent in soft copy due to large number of pages.  In view of the above, and taken the reconciliation effects, there is no mi-utilization. No opportunity was provided by the inspection team to submit such reconciliation. Even the same was submitted along with our submission dated 26th April, 2019. The said submission was even not taken on record.   5. Non \\\\\\\\u2013 reconciliation of daily reconciliation statement: It has been alleged that daily reconciliation statement clearly indicating the amount of funds transferred between client and own account has not been maintained. It has been mentioned that Noticee has not submitted the daily reconciliation statement at the time of inspection to inspection team.  In connection to the above, we would like to submit that we have never been asked for such reconciliation at the time of the inspection. Neither any pending requirements were given during the end of the inspection and neither anything was asked later on. We have submitted the said reconciliation as enclosure \\\\\\\\u2013 6 along with our submission dated 26th April, 2019 which was not taken on record. The same is also enclosed herewith as ", "Date": "2020-11-27", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Adjudication Order in respect of Prudent Broking Services Private Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/nov-2020/adjudication-order-in-respect-of-prudent-broking-services-private-limited_48306.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 57369, "unique_record_id": "ecbdbb7e6dSEBI20201127", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "66805c4c7858910306471298", "parse_date": "2024-06-29 19:10:32", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Non-compliance", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "No financial penalties are mentioned in the article.", "gpt_audience": "1. **Regulatory Authorities**: Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), National Stock Exchange (NSE), Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), Central Depository Services (India) Limited (CDSL)\n2. **Legal Professionals**: Lawyers, Compliance Officers, Legal Advisors\n3. **Financial Institutions**: Banks, Brokerage Firms, Depository Participants\n4. **Investors**: Retail Investors, Institutional Investors, Clients of Prudent Broking Services Private Limited\n5. **Company Management**: Directors, Compliance Officers, Risk Management Teams of Prudent Broking Services Private Limited\n6. **Auditors and Inspectors**: Internal and External Auditors, SEBI Inspectors\n7. **Industry Analysts**: Financial Analysts, Market Researchers\n8. **Media**: Financial Journalists, Business News Reporters\n9. **Educational Institutions**: Business Schools, Law Schools, Research Scholars\n10. **General Public**: Individuals interested in financial regulations and market practices", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

(The aforesaid entities are hereinafter individually referred to by their respective names/Noticee nos. and collectively as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d, unless the context specifies otherwise)  BACKGROUND  1. The genesis of the present proceedings can be traced to a complaint dated September 8, 2014, against Bishal Agri\\\\\\\\u2013Bio Industries Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBishal /Company\\\\\\\\u201d). In the said complaint, it was alleged inter alia that the Company isOrder in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.  Page 2 of 19 mobilizing funds from general public. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d), examined the records of the Company as filed with Ministry of Corporate Affairs (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cMCA\\\\\\\\u201d), as accessible through MCA21 Portal.  2. Based on the examination of the said records, it was unearthed that during the Financial Year 2011-12, the Company has issued and allotted Redeemable Preference Shares (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cRPS\\\\\\\\u201d), to the public at large, details of which are as under:  ALLOTMENT DETAILS OF REDEEMABLE PREFERENCE SHARES\\\\\\\\u2013  TABLE I \\\\\\\\u2013 DETAILS OF REDEEMABLE PREFERENCE SHARES ISSUED FINANCIAL YEAR NO.

The records available further reveal that securities issued in the nature of RPS by the Company were offered and allotted to more than 49 persons and the offer of such securities to more than 49 persons were against the norms prescribed under Companies Act, 1956, governing the issuance of securities and accordingly were found to be having the character of a public issue. It was thus noticed that the Company and its Directors have contravened and violated Section 56, Section 60 read with Section 2(36) and Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956, as the norms governing issuance of securities to public were not complied with. Accordingly, considering the material available on record, it was thought fit that the matter require urgent intervention in order to protect the interest of investors and therefore SEBI vide interim order dated May 06, 2015 (hereinafterOrder in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.

Vide the above mentioned 1st interim order, the Company and its Directors were restrained from raising money from the investors and also were called upon to show cause as to why suitable directions including directing them jointly and severally to refund money collected through the offer of RPS along with interest, should not be issued against them.  5. The proceedings emanating from the 1st interim order ultimately culminated into passing of a final order dated May 16, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe final order\\\\\\\\u201d), wherein, inter alia, following directions were issued:   a) Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Limited, Mr. Madhab Chandra Purkait, Mr. Gautam Kumar Halder, Mr. Mohd Kalimullah Baidya, Mr. Ram Kumar Sinha, Mr. Sushant Kumar, Mr. Sachin Kumar Thakur, Mr. Sankar Bhattacharjee, Mr. Chandan Shah, Mr. Ratan Chowdhury and Smt.

While conducting the quasi-judicial proceedings that led to the passing of  final order, it was observed that, apart from the above named Directors of the Company as held liable in the 1st interim order, there were also certain other  Directors of the Company (Noticees in present proceedings), against whom no directions were issued in the 1st interim order although the said  Directors were also prima facie, viewed as  responsible for the violations of provisions under Section 56, 60, 67 and 73 of the Companies Act, 1956. Accordingly, in the above mentioned final order, it was also directed that:  \\\\\\\\u201cAs the refunds are not made, SEBI is advised to examine the role of the aforesaid persons and initiate appropriate action against them, in accordance with law, including issuance of a show cause notice calling upon them to show cause as to why, suitable directions including the following should not be imposed upon them:   a. directing them jointly and severally to refund the money collected through the issue of RPS (as found to be unauthorisedly issued in this Order), along with interest at 15% per annum from the date when the refunds became due to the investors till the date of repayment;   b. directing them not to issue prospectus or any offer document or issue advertisement for soliciting money from the public for the issue of securities, in any manner whatsoever, either directly or indirectly, for an appropriate period;   c. directions restraining them from accessing the securities market and prohibiting them from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities for an appropriate period;Order in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.  Page 5 of 19 d. directing them and other companies in which they are directors/promoters holding substantial or controlling interest, to not access the capital market for an appropriate period.\\\\\\\\u201d  7. In compliance with the aforesaid directions issued in the final order, SEBI, undertook examination of the role of the Noticees (in the present proceedings) so as to determine their liabilities.  Based on the outcome of the said examination, another interim order dated October 10, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201c2nd interim order\\\\\\\\u201d) was passed.  In the 2nd interim order, the details of the directorship of the Noticees with the Company have been recorded as under:                                                                                        TABLE II  NAME OF THE PERSON CAPACITY DIN PAN DATE OF APPT.

Further, the 2nd interim order records the following observations with respect to the role and responsibility of the Noticees:  \\\\\\\\u201c10. I note that the person at serial no. 1 of Table II was the Directors of Bishal Agri\\\\\\\\u2013Bio during the period of money mobilization by the Company. The person at serial nos. 2\\\\\\\\u20137 of Table II were Directors of Bishal Agri\\\\\\\\u2013Bio, post the fund\\\\\\\\u2013mobilization by the Company. Upon a consideration of paragraph 3 of this Order, I find that the aforementioned entities are responsible for the offer and allotment of RedeemableOrder in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.  Page 6 of 19 Preference Shares made by Bishal Agri\\\\\\\\u2013Bio in violation of the Public Issue requirements. I also find that the entity at sr. no. 1 of Table II is liable for refund of money to investors to whom such offer and allotment of Redeemable Preference Shares was made by Bishal Agri\\\\\\\\u2013Bio. In the light of the aforesaid, I find this to be a fit case to pass interim directions against the aforesaid Director of Bishal Agri\\\\\\\\u2013Bio.\\\\\\\\u201d  9. The 2nd interim order, based on the aforesaid prima facie findings, goes on to issue the following directions under Para 11 of the 2nd interim order:  i. The Directors of Bishal Agri\\\\\\\\u2013Bio, viz. Priti Rani Chowdhury, Ajoy Paul, Kuntal Bhattacharjee, Sumanta Modak, Litan Saha, Tapas Kumar Mondal and Shashi Kant Dubey, shall not access the securities market or buy, sell or otherwise deal in the securities market, either directly or indirectly, or associate themselves with any listed company or company intending to raise money from the public; ii. Priti Rani Chowdhury shall neither dispose of, alienate or encumber any of her assets nor divert any funds raised from public through the offer and allotment of Redeemable Preference Shares; iii. The abovenamed Directors of Bishal Agri\\\\\\\\u2013Bio shall co-operate with SEBI and shall furnish all information/documents in connection with the offer and allotment of Redeemable Preference Shares sought vide letter dated December 28, 2017.  10. The aforesaid directions against the Noticees were issued upon consideration of the material available on record. Further, in order to ensure protection of interest of investors as well as to provide opportunity of a fair trial to the Noticees, the Noticees were also called upon vide the 2nd interim order to show cause as to why suitable directions should not be issued/imposed on them, including the following directions, viz. \\\\\\\\u2013 i. To jointly and severally refund the money collected through the offer and allotment of Redeemable Preference Shares, with an interest of 15% per annum (the interest beingOrder in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.  Page 7 of 19 calculated from the date when the repayments became due in terms of Section 73(2) of the Companies Act till the date of actual payment), supported by a Certificate of two independent Chartered Accountants to the satisfaction of SEBI (to be submitted to SEBI within 7 days of completion of the refund); and ii. To be restrained/prohibited from accessing the securities market and buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, for a period of four years from the date of effecting the refund as directed above read with the Final Order dated May 16, 2016. 11. I note that the Noticees were granted time of 21 days from the date of receipt of the 2nd interim order, to file reply and a time of 90 days to avail opportunity of personal hearing, failing which, the 2nd interim order has recorded that the prima facie findings recorded against the Noticees in the said 2nd interim order would become final qua the Noticees without any further orders, and the directions issued therein as reproduced under para 9 and 10 above, shall become absolute.  12. From the records, I note that the copy of the 2nd interim order was served on Noticee nos. 2, 4 and 7 by hand delivery whereas the service on remaining Noticees viz., Noticee nos. 1, 3, 5 and 6 could be effected by way of newspaper publication carried out in The Times of India, The Anandabazar Patrika and Sanmarg, in the editions dated May 02, 2019, as the same could not be served due to the following reasons: Noticee  No. Details of the Noticee Remarks 1 Priti Rani Chowdhury  56, Central Road, Kolkata, W.B.-70032 Noticee left the address  5 Litan Saha  Noticee left the address.

I note that despite effecting the service of the said 2nd interim order on all the Noticees, only Noticee nos. 3, 4 and 7 have filed their written replies, the rest of the Noticees viz., Noticee nos. 1, 2, 5 and 6 have neither filed any reply nor have they requested for personal hearing before me, hence the directions contemplated to be issued in the 2nd interim order have now become absolute and final qua them (Noticee nos. 1, 2, 5 and 6).  14. I further note that Noticee no. 3 (Kuntal Bhattacharjee) has filed a written reply dated December 10, 2018 and also has filed a written submission dated February 18, 2020 followed by an amended submission vide email dated September 29, 2020. It has been submitted by the Noticee no. 3 that:  i. The allegations made against him are baseless.  ii. He was appointed as a Project In-Charge in Bishal Distilleries on September 21, 2010. Subsequently, he was appointed as a Director of the Company for the limited period of February 10, 2014 to March 26, 2014. Reliance has been placed on the order dated August 09, 2019, passed by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSAT\\\\\\\\u201d), in the matter of Sayanti Sen Vs. SEBI, to contend that every Director should not be penalized for the acts of the company.  iii. During the period of his Directorship, no violation has been alleged to have been committed by the Company and therefore no liability should be fastened against him.Order in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.  Page 9 of 19 iv. He has not utilized any money belonging to the Company for his personal use.  v. He has repaid some money to the creditors/depositors of the Company, out of his own source of funds.  vi. The liabilities of Bishal Group of Companies were handed over to G.R. Agro Projects Ltd., through a meeting presided over by Shri Shankar Bhattacharjee (Chairman), and it\\\\\\\\u2019s now the liability of G.R. Agro Projects Ltd., to refund the money.  vii. Newspaper publications for returning the money to the depositors have been carried out in various newspapers like \\\\\\\\u201cThe Telegraph Calcutta\\\\\\\\u201d, on June 13, 2014; \\\\\\\\u201cSangbad Pratidin\\\\\\\\u201d on June 18, 2014 by G.R. Agro Projects Ltd. and \\\\\\\\u201cBartaman\\\\\\\\u201d on December 20, 2014 by Bishal Group Welfare Trust Limited. viii. A public notice dated July 07, 2014 was issued by the Noticee no. 3 in \\\\\\\\u201cBusiness Standard\\\\\\\\u201d and another public notice dated June 06, 2014 was issued in \\\\\\\\u201cDainik Statesman\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cDainik Lipi\\\\\\\\u201d, declaring that the Noticee no. 3 is not connected with companies including Bishal Agri Bio Industries Limited w.e.f. June 05, 2014. It was further stated in the said public notices that G.R. Agro Project Limited may be approached by anyone having interest/claim against the companies including Bishal Agri Bio Industries Limited.  ix. In terms of the Chakadha P.S. Case no. 627/2014 and 698/2015, one Mr. Madhab Chandra Purakit, while acting as a Director of the Company, has sold properties belonging to the Company. Further, many vehicles have been seized from Mr. Litan Saha by officials of Chakadha P.S. x. As he is not associated with the Company anymore, he has no submission to offer regarding the selling off the properties of the Company to pay the investors of the Company.Order in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.  Page 10 of 19 i. Similarly, Noticee no. 4 (Sumanta Mondak) had filed his reply dated December 21, 2018 and then a written submission dated February 18, 2020 followed by another amended written submission vide email dated September 29, 2020. Noticee no. 4 has made almost identical submissions, as have been made by Noticee no. 3, with the one factual variance that he was appointed as an employee in Bishal Group of Companies in the year 2012. Subsequently, he was appointed as Director of the Company for the period of February 10, 2014 to March 26, 2014.  15. Noticee no. 7 (Mr. Shashi Kant Dubey) in his written reply vide letter dated December 28, 2018 has submitted inter alia that: i. He was working as an agent of Bishal Group of Companies since January, 2011. He has also made certain investments in different group companies of Bishal Group.  ii. He was appointed as Director of the Company for the period of March 24, 2014 to June 10, 2014. He is not having any knowledge with respect to responsibilities of a Director nor was he involved in any of the matters of the Company except for working as a commission agent during that period.  iii. He has not attended any Board Meeting nor has received any salary.  iv. The Bishal Group of Companies defaulted on payment of maturity amount due to the investors from December, 2013.  16. Since the aforesaid three Noticees have responded to the 2nd interim order by making written submissions. Noticee nos. 3, 4 and 7, were granted opportunity of personal hearing on January 21, 2020, which was rescheduled to February 07, 2020. On the said date of hearing, the counsel for the Noticee nos. 3 and 4 appeared before me and requested for adjournment on the ground of non-availability of the arguing counsel. In view of the request made, the personal hearing in the matter was re-fixed on July 21, 2020, but again on that day, a request for adjournment was made on behalf ofOrder in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.  Page 11 of 19 Noticee nos. 3 and 4 on two grounds viz.: that the arguing counsel is suffering from health issues and that an application for obtaining certified copy of certain documents have been filed in the month of February, 2020 have not been received on account of   imposition of lockdown owing to Covid-19. It was further submitted that the said documents are essential to counter the allegations made against the Noticees in the SCN. The counsel was advised to provide certain details and in the interest of justice, one last opportunity of personal hearing was granted to them and hearing was adjourned to August 16, 2020 with the consent of the said Noticees.  17. Accordingly, on August 16, 2020, the Authorized Representatives (AR) of the Noticee nos. 3 and 4 appeared before me through Video Conferencing and made oral submissions on the lines of the replies already filed on behalf of the aforesaid Noticees. During the said hearing, the AR also referred to certain documents, claimed to be pertaining to attachment of vehicles belonging to the Company. Based on the submissions made by the AR during the course of personal hearing, certain queries were raised and the AR was also advised to file certain documents viz., the resignation letter as Director(s) from the Board of the Company & copy of relevant MCA records; details of mode of acquisition of liabilities of the Company by G. R. Agro and other documents like copy of agreements, balance sheets, valuation reports etc. Subsequently thereafter, the AR, vide his email dated August 31, 2020, sought time to file the documents stating that the Noticees are yet to provide him the requisite documents. Later on, vide email dated September 14, 2020, the aforesaid Noticees were once again advised to provide the requisite documents as called for during their personal hearing. In response thereto, vide email dated September 29, 2020, the Authorized Representative filed amended written submissions on behalf of the said Noticees.Order in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.  Page 12 of 19 18. From the perusal of the said amended written submissions, it is noted that apart from providing certain additional information regarding seizing of vehicles, they are conspicuously silent on various other items of information which were specifically called from the Noticees and to furnish those documents, the  Noticees were  granted adjournment of personal hearing scheduled on July 21, 2020, as they had submitted  that the required documents are not available for which they needed some more time. Nevertheless, I have to proceed on to conclude my observations based on the materials available to me from the records and by the Noticees during the course of proceedings.   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS:  19. In the present proceedings, the limited issue that arises for my consideration is to determine the liabilities of the Noticees herein towards the violations committed by the Company which have been recorded in the final order dated May 16, 2016-. The said findings are reproduced hereunder for ready reference: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026In view of the above observations, I conclude that the Company made a public offer and issued RPS during FY 2011-12 without complying with the provisions of sections 56, 60 and 73 of the Companies Act, 1956 and mobilized funds to the tune of Rs.3 crore\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d 20. Before me, nothing has been produced to suggest that any challenge/appeal has been made by any of the Noticees who were named in the final order dated May 16, 2016 and on the basis of which 2nd interim order cum SCN was passed, against the present Noticees. In view thereof, the findings of the said final order have attained finality. Therefore, the limited scope of the instant proceedings is to examine the roleOrder in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.  Page 13 of 19 and liability of the above named three Noticees, who have responded to the allegations made in the 2nd interim order cum SCN.  21. As noted earlier, it was stipulated in the 2nd interim order that if the Noticees do not make out their case by filing replies and/or availing opportunities of personal hearing, the directions as contemplated under the 2nd interim order shall become final and absolute. It has been noted above that Noticee nos. 1, 2, 5 and 6 have failed to file any reply and therefore the directions issued to them in the 2nd interim order which have been reproduced at para 10 above, have now become final and absolute against them, in terms of the mandate of 2nd interim order.  22. However, only Noticee nos. 3, 4 and 7 have filed their respective replies to the allegations made under the 2nd interim order and only Noticee no. 3 and 4 availed the opportunity of personal hearing to present their case, I proceed to deal with the submissions made and arguments advanced by the said Noticees, in their defense. 23. I find that the only question that merits consideration before me is whether Noticee nos. 3, 4 and 7 in the present proceedings in their respective role as Directors of the Company are liable for issuance of directions against them as contemplated at para 12 of the 2nd interim order and have also been reproduced at para 10 above in this order.  24. The available records on MCA 21 Portal show that these three Noticees before me were Additional Directors of the Company during the FY 2013-14 and 2014-15, whereas the RPS issue was made by the Company in the FY 2011-12. Their directorship on the Board of the Company including tenure thereof has already been elucidated in the 1st interim order and none of these Directors has disputed the same. The main submissions made on behalf of Noticee no. 3 and Noticee no. 4 are that they were employed with the Bishal group of Companies in different functional areas/jobOrder in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.  Page 14 of 19 profiles as employees, whereas Noticee no. 7 has claimed to be agent of the Company, and were not holding the post of Director at the relevant time of issuance of RPS by the Company. It has also been argued that though they held the post of Directorship of the Company, the same was for a very brief period of a few months only and during the said periods, they did not participate in any Board processes which were related to the violations alleged against the Company, so as to be held personally liable for the same. It has been further argued that Mr. Ratan Chowdhary (Noticee no. 10 to the final Order), was the Managing Director of the Company and was the sole in-charge of the RPS issue and the above Noticees had no say in the management of affairs of the Company. The Noticees have submitted that even though they were holding the post of Directors, they were not associated with the conducting and managing the affairs of the Company in any manner. In any case, the Noticee nos. 3, 4 and 7 have undisputedly held the post of Directors of the Company only during the period of post issuance of RPS, as has already been sated in the preceding part of this order.  25. It is also noted that vide final order dated May 16, 2016, the Company and other Noticees have been found to have indulged in activities in violations of Section 56, 60, 67(3), 73(1) and 73(3) of Companies Act, 1956. The said final order also held categorically that the Company has issued RPS to 284 persons and raised money amounting to INR 3.00 Crore during F.Y. 2011-12. I find that the said findings have not been assailed before any court of law and have attained finality. I further note that even the Noticees before me have not denied or disputed the issuance of RPS and mobilization of funds as mentioned above. I note that the public issue of RPS by the Company falls squarely within the scope of Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956 since, in terms of the first proviso to section 67(3), an offer of shares or debenturesOrder in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.  Page 15 of 19 made to fifty persons or more would constitute an offer to the public and in this case, undisputedly the Company has on record issued RPS to 284 persons.  26. As stated above, the Company till date has not preferred to file any appeal against the findings recorded against it in the final order which remains un-assailed. The submissions of the Noticees in the present proceedings center around the contentions that they were neither holding the post of Directors nor were involved in the management and other business affairs of the Company during the relevant point of time when the RPS were issued hence, they should not be held accountable for the alleged violations committed by the Company while mobilizing funds through issuance of RPS. Against the aforesaid background, the limited issue that remain for consideration here is the determination of liability of the said Noticees, in their respective capacity of Directors of the Company, for a period of few months during the post RPS issuance period.  27. From a conjoint reading of the provisions of law prescribed under Sections 56, 60, 67 and 73 of the Companies Act, 18956, it is noted that in case of public offer, the provisions relating to public issue such as filing of prospectus, listing of securities and consequence of failure to get the securities listed on the Stock Exchange etc., as provided under Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956 come into play. Section 73 provides that where the permission has not been applied for, or such permission having been applied for has not been granted, a company shall forthwith repay without interest all the moneys received from the applicants (of securities) in pursuance of the prospectus, and, if any such money is not repaid within eight days after the company becomes liable to repay it, the company and every Director of the company who is an officer in default shall, on and from the expiry of the eighth day, become jointly and severally liable to repay that money with interest.Order in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.  Page 16 of 19 28.  Having considered the above facts and the provisions of relevant law governing public issues of securities under the Companies Act, 1956 I find it appropriate to seek guidance from the judicial decisions in order to determine the liability of a person holding the responsible post of Director in the Company. As the issue in hand pertains to mobilization of fund in contraventions of provisions of law as stated above, as a consequence, the matter deserves consideration from the point of view of refund of the funds so mobilized, and the relevant provisions of law dealing with the same are provided under Section 73 (2) read with Section 5 of the Companies Act, 1956. In this regard, it is relevant to mention here that the issue of liability of \\\\\\\\u2018Officer in Default\\\\\\\\u2019 as provided under Section 5 of the Companies Act, 1956 also came up for consideration before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSAT\\\\\\\\u201d) in the mater of Pritha Bag v. SEBI [Appeal no. 291/2017 \\\\\\\\u2013 DoD February 14, 2019] wherein it has been held that, \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026.In the instant case, the appellant has annexed documents to indicate that the company had a managing director, namely, Mr. Indranath Daw and, therefore, as per the provisions of Section 5 the managing director would be an officer in default. \\\\\\\\u2026Reliance on the judgment of this Court by the respondent in the case of Manoj Agarwal vs. SEBI in Appeal No. 66 of 2016 decided on July 14, 2017 is not applicable and is distinguishable. The Tribunal in the case of Manoj Agarwal found that there was no material to show that any of the officers set out in clauses (a) to (c) of Section 5 or any specified director of the said company was entrusted to discharge the application contained in Section 73 of the Companies Act. In the instant case, there is sufficient material on record to show that there was a managing director and in the absence of any finding that the appellant was entrusted to discharge the application contained in Section 73 of the Companies Act, the direction to refund the amount along with interest from the appellant is wholly illegal\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d 29. I find that in the instant matter, the aforesaid Noticees, have submitted that Mr. Ratan Chowdhary, who was a Director of the Company during the period June 30, 2008 toOrder in the matter of Bishal Agri-Bio Industries Ltd.  Page 17 of 19 February 18, 2014 was acting as the Managing Director, and later on Mr. Chandan Shah became the Managing Director. Though, Noticees have not furnished any document in support of the above claim, however, it is noted from the records that it was Mr. Chandan Shah (Noticee no. 9 to the final order), was appointed as Managing Director of the Company on December 31, 2012 and he remained as Managing Director as such, till June 10, 2014. It is further noted from the final order that subsequently, Mr. Madhab Chandra Purkait (Noticee no. 2 to the final order), who was appointed as Director on October 10, 2014, became the Managing Director of the Company thereafter. Insofar as the liability of Noticee nos. 3, 4 and 7 is concerned, I note that the Noticee no. 3 and 4 were Directors of the Company for a very brief period of February 10, 2014 to March 26, 2014, whereas Noticee no. 7 was Director of the Company for another small period of March 24, 2014 to June 10, 2014.  As noted above, Mr. Chandan Shah (Noticee no. 9 to the final order) was undeniably acting as a Managing Director throughout the period of directorship of Noticee nos. 3, 4 and 7.

It was also observed that MPS had not disclosed an amount of US $ 8.88 million (as on March 31, 2008) lying in its account with BANCO as contingent liability in its financial statements for the financial year 2007-08. By not disclosing the contingent liability in its financial statements, MPS had not adhered to the provisions of Audit Standard (AS) \\\\\\\\u2013 29 issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).  It was also observed that MPS had devised a fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative scheme through the arrangement of Credit Agreement entered by Clifford Capital Partners A.G.S.A.  (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cCLIFFORD\\\\\\\\u201d) with BANCO, wherein the subscription amount of GDRs was paid by CLIFFORD by availing a loan from BANCO and Account Charge agreement entered into with BANCO by MPS by pledging the proceeds of GDR as collateral against the loan availed by CLIFFORD. The aforesaid arrangement was not disclosed in public domain, which not only misled investors with such false and misleading information, but also enabled MPS to made investors to believe that the said GDR issue was genuinely subscribed by the foreign investors and influenced the decision of investors to deal in the shares of MPS. The aforesaid manipulative and deceptive act had resulted in allotment of GDRs without actual receipt of consideration.   It was also observed that the Board of Noticee had passed a Resolution in its Meeting on October 19, 2007, wherein decision was taken to open an account with BANCO and also to authorize BANCO to use the GDR proceeds as security against loan. The said Board Resolution, inter alia, included opening of a bank account with BANCO for the purpose of receiving subscription money in respect of the GDR issue of the Company. The company had authorized Mr. Rajinder Singh to enter into any escrow agreement or similar arrangements and authorized BANCO to use the funds deposited in its bank account as a security in connection with loans sanctioned to CLIFFORD, had acted as a parties to the fraudulent, manipulative and deceptive scheme.

The fact of the case and the allegations made in the SCN are summarised below:  a) SEBI had conducted investigation during November 01, 2007 to December 31, 2007 regarding the issuance of Global Depository Receipts (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cGDRs\\\\\\\\u201d) by M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd. It was observed that M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd. issued 46,54,762 Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) (US$9.99 Million, approximately Rs. 39.42 Crores) on December 04, 2007. Summary of GDRs issued by M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd is as under:  GDR issue  date No. of GDRs Issued (mn.) Capital raised (US$ mn.)

MPS Infotecnics Ltd.                                       Page 5 | 25  of Credit Agreement and Account Charge Agreement by CLIFFORD and the Company respectively.  c) The aforesaid fraudulent arrangement of Credit Agreement and Account Charge Agreement resulted in subscription of GDR issue of the company and the aforesaid arrangement was not disclosed by Noticee. Further, the company submitted a false list of GDR subscribers to SEBI.  The corporate announcements made by the Company were meant to mislead the investors that the GDRs were fully subscribed whereas the GDR issue was indirectly supported by the company itself. Its alleged that the aforesaid failure by Company influenced the decision of investors to deal in the shares of MPS.    d) from the documents available on record, following utilization of the GDRs was observed:   Date of debit in MPS\\\\\\\\u2019 account with Banco Amount of USD debited in MPS\\\\\\\\u2019 account with Banco Date of credit to MPS\\\\\\\\u2019 Indian bank account Amount of funds received by  MPS in India (INR) Remarks 07/01/2008 950,000.00 08/01/2008 3,72,57,726.00 Received in Indian bank account of MPS with DBS Bank 07/01/2008 150,000.00 NA NA Legal Charges for Lead manager 09/01/2008 17,798.00 NA NA Lead manager\\\\\\\\u2019s Fee 03/04/2008 200,000.00 NA NA Paid to Global Absolute Research P.

MPS Infotecnics Ltd.                                       Page 6 | 25  e) It was observed from the company\\\\\\\\u2019s deposit account (a/c no: 6434108525008) with BANCO that an amount of US $8.80 million was transferred to its current account with BANCO (i.e. a/c no: 6341085.15.001) on March 20, 2009 and there was no balance lying in the deposit account as on March 20, 2009. It was observed that an amount of $8.89 million, US $0.01 million were debited to company\\\\\\\\u2019s current account on March 20, 2009 and April 14, 2009 respectively. It was further observed that an amount of US $8.89 million (principal amount due- US $8,798,450, interest due- US $84760.75) was due from CLIFFORD to BANCO on March 20, 2009 and accordingly an amount of US $8.89 million was adjusted by BANCO towards the outstanding loan amount of CLIFFORD, as the company has guaranteed to the Loan taken by CLIFFORD through account charge agreement. It was further observed that an amount of US $0.01 million was adjusted by BANCO on April 14, 2009 as default interest for failure to pay the loan outstanding on due date.   f) Therefore, from the aforesaid, it was noted that CLIFFORD was the sole subscriber to the GDR issue, it has defaulted in repayment of Loan and also received GDRs, thereby GDRs to the extent of US $8.90 million were issued at free of cost. Hence, it was alleged that the issuance of GDRs at free of cost to the extent of US $8.90 million to CLIFFORD at the cost of other investors was fraudulent and thereby violated provisions of sections 12A (a), (b), (c) read with Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4 (1) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003.  g) It was further observed from the corporate announcements made by the company to stock exchange during the investigation period that the company did not inform stock exchange with regard to account charge agreement entered with BANCO for subscription of GDRs of the company which was price sensitive information and could have impacted the price of scrip.

Page 7 | 25   h) The GDRs of the company were delisted from Singapore Exchange on August 28, 2014 and the GDR facility was terminated by Depository i.e. Bank of New York Mellon on July 13, 2015. However, the Noticee did not inform stock exchange about the delisting of GDRs and termination of GDR facility which were material events as well as price sensitive information.  i) Therefore, it was alleged that Noticee violated Clause 36(7) of the Listing Agreement read with Section 21 of the SCRA.   j) It was noted that Accounting Standard \\\\\\\\u2013 1 requires a company to consider prudence, substance over form and materiality as major consideration while drafting its accounting policies. It is alleged that the Noticee did not follow prudence since it did not provide for the potential liability, did not follow substance over form and presented its encumbered cash balance as free cash available with the company and also did not follow materiality as it did not disclose the fact of Account Charge Agreement and the encumbrance on the cash balance as the same is an item, the knowledge of which might influence the decisions of the user of the financial Statements.  k) Noticee in its annual report for financial year 2007-08 had stated that financial statements were prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. It was observed from the annual report for the year 2007-08 that the company had shown cash and Cash equivalents (\\\\\\\\u2018CCE\\\\\\\\u2019) as on March 31, 2008 as Rs 35.53 crore in its Cash flow statement and balance sheet. It was observed that out of Rs 35.53 crore, an amount of Rs 35.06 crore was lying in deposit account with Banco which was pledged against loan taken by Clifford. Hence, it is alleged that amount of Rs 35.06 crore lying in deposit account with Banco cannot be termed CCE as per AS-3. Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd.                                       Page 8 | 25  l) As mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, the company had pledged its GDR proceeds against the loan taken by CLIFFORD for subscription of GDRs of the company. In the instant matter, it is observed that the company can withdraw its GDR proceeds only to the extent of amount of loan repaid by CLIFFORD and there was a possible obligation on the company for an amount of US $8.80 million (balance lying in the account no: 634108525004) on the date of balance sheet i.e. March 31, 2008 in the event of default of repayment of loan taken by CLIFFORD which is of contingent liability in nature. It was observed from the annual report of MPS for the FY ended 2007-08 that the company had not disclosed an amount of US $8.80 million (as on March 31, 2008) lying in deposit account with BANCO as contingent liability in its Financial statements for the FY 2007-08 till FY 2015-16. Therefore, it is alleged that the Noticee failed to comply with the AS-29.  m) Therefore, it is alleged that the Noticee did not comply with the Accounting Standards as stated above and hence, violated Clauses 32 and 50 of the Listing Agreement read with Section 21 of the SCRA.  5. In response to the aforesaid SCN dated May 28, 2018, the Noticee filed its replies which, inter-alia, is summarised as under:  Reply submitted by the Noticee  Noticee vide its reply dated June 13, 2018 and November 11, 2020 made its submissions to the SCN which is summarised as below:  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 At the outset, we deny all the allegations and findings made against us in the SCN. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Company issued GDR on 4th December 2007 after complying with all requirements applicable laws \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Incomplete inspection of documents, SEBI did not provide original/certified true copy of all documents Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s.

We submit that Company had no knowledge whatsoever pertaining to the execution of the allege account charge agreement.

During the said inspection, the Noticee sought original or certified true copies of Credit Agreement and Account Charge Agreement along with cover letter of overseas Authority from which these agreements have been received by SEBI along with Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd.                                       Page 14 | 25  certain other documents.

MPS Infotecnics Ltd.                                       Page 15 | 25  b) With regard to Noticee seeking original or certified true copies of Credit Agreement and Account Charge Agreement along with cover letter of overseas Authority from which these agreements have been received by SEBI, I note that the copies of the documents relied upon, were obtained by SEBI during investigation, through overseas securities market regulators. As copies of all the documents relied upon by SEBI in the SCN was already provided to the Noticee, I find that no prejudice has been caused to Noticee in defending its interest and contesting the allegation made against it in the SCN.   c) From the facts of the case, I find that the Board of the Noticee had passed a Resolution in its Meeting on October 19, 2007, wherein decision was taken to open an account with BANCO and also to authorize BANCO to use the GDR proceeds as security against loan.   The said Board Resolution, inter alia, included opening of a bank account with BANCO  for the purpose of receiving subscription money in respect of the GDR issue of the Company. The company had authorized Mr Rajinder Singh to enter into any escrow agreement or similar arrangements and authorized BANCO to use the funds deposited in its bank account as a security in connection with loans if any availed. On the basis of authorization given by the Board, Mr Rajinder Singh signed the agreement which acted as a security to the loan availed by CLIFFORD for subscription of GDRs. It was further observed that directors i.e. Peeyush Aggarwal, Sanjiv Bhavnani, S. N. Sharma, Adesh Jain and Karun Jain were present and approved the proceedings of the board meeting dated October 19, 2007. The relevant extract of the Board resolution dated October 19, 2007 is as under:   \\\\\\\\u201cRESOLVED THAT the bank account be kept opened with Banco Efisa S.A. (\"the Bank\") or any branch of Banco Efisa S.A., including the Offshore Branch, Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd.

Resolved further that the Bank be and is hereby authorized to use the funds so deposited in the aforesaid bank account as security in connection with loans if any as well as to enter into any Escrow Agreement or similar agreements if and when so required.\"  d) I further observe that on December 04, 2007 MPS issued 4.65 million GDRs (amounting to USD 9.99 million) which was subscribed by CLIFFORD and GDRs were listed in Singapore Stock Exchange. CLIFFORD was the only entity who had subscribed to the entire issue of GDRs and the subscription amount was paid by CLIFFORD by obtained a loan of USD 10 million (i.e., through credit agreement dated October 29, 2007) from BANCO. I also note that simultaneously, an Account Charge Agreement was executed between MPS and BANCO, by pledging the proceeds of the GDR issue to BANCO. The account charge agreement was an integral part of the aforesaid Credit Agreement entered into between CLIFFORD and BANCO. These agreements Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s.

Subscription of GDRs of MPS by CLIFFORD was possible only through Credit Agreement entered into by CLIFFORD with BANCO and Account Charge Agreement entered into by MPS with BANCO. I note that MPS had informed BSE on December 5, 2007 that \\\\\\\\u201cthe Company has successfully closed its maiden Global Depository Receipts (GDR) offering of US$ 10,000,000 on the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) on December 4, 2007.

FACTS OF THE CASE: 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) conducted investigation into the initial public offer of Birla Pacific Medspa Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBPML\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cthe Company\\\\\\\\u201d), for the period from July 7, 2011 to July 15, 2011 (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d), since there was high volatility on the day of listing.  2. Based on the findings of the investigation, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings against credo India Thematic Fund Ltd. (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) under Section 15A(b) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d), for the alleged violation of Violation of Regulation13(3) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992. (hereinafter be referred to as, the \\\\\\\\u201cPIT Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 3. SEBI appointed the Shri D. Sura Reddy as the Adjudicating Officer under section 15 I of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (\\\\\\\\u201cAO Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge the aforesaid allegations under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act on March 10, 2017. Subsequently, Shri Jeevan Sonaparote was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter after which the undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter on September 26, 2019.Page 2 of 3   SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 4. A Show Cause Notice dated April 20, 2017 (hereinafter be referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to the Noticee under Rule 4 of the AO Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated and penalty be not imposed under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act for the allegations as detailed in the said SCN.  5. The scrip of BPML was listed on BSE on July 7, 2011, after IPO which was open for subscription from June 20, 2011- June 23, 2011. It was observed that the Noticee was allotted 1,11,00,000 shares (9.9% shares) in the IPO of BPML. Subsequently, the Noticee sold 81,50,000 shares (7.27% shares) during the period July-September, 2011. However, the requisite disclosure to the exchange was not made and hence it was alleged that the Noticee failed to make appropriate disclosures under Reg. 13(3) of the PIT Regulations. 6. In terms of Regulation 13(3) read with Regulation 13(5) of PIT Regulations a disclosure in Form C has to be made to the company and to the Stock Exchange by any person who is holding more than 5% shares for any transaction which leads to a change in excess of 2% shareholding; and such disclosure has to be made within two working days of such change. 7. The Noticee vide letter dated May 2, 2017 submitted its reply to the SCN stating that it had made the appropriate disclosure on August 12, 2011.  8. Since the undersigned was appointed as AO subsequently, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on November 12, 2020 through email dated October 29, 2020. The Noticee vide e-mail dated October 29, 2020 sought a copy of the SCN which was provided to the Noticee by email dated November 2, 2020. The Noticee resent its reply dated May 2, 2017 vide email dated November 6, 2020 and wanted to know if it needed to attend the hearing. Since, the submissions were made on the preliminary factual issue, the Noticee was informed by email on November 11, 2020 that it shall be intimated after examining the record. 9. In order to ascertain whether the Noticee had indeed made the disclosure, a mail was sent to BSE on November 16, 2020 wherein the disclosure of the Noticee was attached and BSE was asked to confirm if they had received the disclosure as claimed by the Noticee. BSE vide e-mail dated November 18,Page 3 of 3  2020 stated that it had received the disclosure from the Noticee on August 12, 2011.  ORDER 10. Since the disclosures were to be made to the company and the exchanges, the only remaining verification was to be done with BPML. However, BPML hasn\\\\\\\\u2019t responded to even the SCN or hearing notice in the instant matter. Thus, it is not possible to ascertain the receipt of disclosure by BPML. In any case, since the disclosure was made to exchange, it would indicate that the information has been disseminated in the public domain.  11. As stated earlier, since the Noticee has submitted that it had made appropriate disclosures as mandated in the PIT Regulations and the same has also been confirmed by the exchange, it is clear that the allegations leveled in the SCN cannot be sustained. Accordingly, the SCN against the Noticee is disposed off.  12. Copies of this Adjudication Order are being sent to the Noticee and also to SEBI in terms of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules.

While the investigation conducted into the matter, inter alia, revealed that Mr. Sanjay Dutt and his associated entities had indulged in insider trading in the scrip of NDTV (for which separate proceedings have been initiated) at the same time, the investigation also concurrently detected that the two Noticees in the instant proceedings, namely, Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs.  Radhika Roy have carried out insider trading in the scrip of NDTV during the Investigation Period. The findings arising from the investigation with respect to the two Noticees in the present proceedings have been highlighted hereunder:  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 2 Entities                                       Page 2 of 90  (1) As per NDTV\\\\\\\\u2019s Annual Reports for the financial years 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09, Mr. Prannoy Roy, apart from being one of the promoters, was also the Chairman and Whole Time Director of NDTV during the investigation period. Further, Mrs.  Radhika Roy, who is the spouse of Mr. Prannoy Roy, was also one of the promoters and also served as the Managing Director of NDTV.   (2) The equity shares of NDTV were listed on National Stock Exchange of India Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNSE\\\\\\\\u201d) and BSE Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBSE\\\\\\\\u201d). In the course of investigation, information pertaining to various corporate announcements made by NDTV as gathered from the Company and stock exchanges were perused from which it was revealed that the Company had filed six (6) price sensitive information (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPSI\\\\\\\\u201d) for disclosure during the Investigation Period. The details of those price sensitive events and the respective periods of unpublished price sensitive information (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cUPSI\\\\\\\\u201d) with regard to each of those PSIs are depicted in the following table:  PSI Start date of UPSI  Date & time when the PSI was disclosed on exchange website UPSI period PSI-1: Expansion of the Company in areas beyond news to develop NDTV into a bouquet of channels with entertainment and lifestyle and initiate a major thrust in New Media including the internet.

Accordingly, PSI-6 merits further elaboration as under:  (a) NDTV, vide an announcement dated April 16, 2008, informed the stock exchanges that:  (i) the Board of Directors at their meeting held on April 16, 2008, decided to evaluate options for reorganisation of the Company with the objective of unlocking shareholder value and to promote focused growth of its various businesses. The aforesaid reorganisation of NDTV could include de-merger /split of the Company into:  - News related businesses; and  - investments in 'Beyond News' businesses which are currently held through its subsidiary NDTV Networks Plc.   (ii) The creation of focused entities would also enable bringing in strategic and financial partners who have been in discussions with the Company from time to time. To give effect to the above, the Board has decided to constitute a Committee to evaluate various options keeping in view interest of all stakeholders and take appropriate steps including appointment of financial and legal advisors, etc. The above reorganisation plan would be subject to requisite statutory process and approvals.  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 2 Entities                                       Page 4 of 90  (b) The announcement made by NDTV regarding its decision to evaluate options for reorganisation of the Company with the objective of unlocking shareholder value and to promote focused growth was certainly a significant change in the business plans and operations of the Company and, hence, it was a price sensitive information in terms of regulation 2(ha)(vii) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  (c) Some of the pertinent events/correspondences preceding to the filing of PSI-6 in Stock Exchanges and thereafter, are indicated in the table below:  S.No. Date and Time Subject of the e-mail /Event Contents in brief 1.  07/09/2007 20:12 hrs News Re Organization KPMG Checklist - Information requirements Checklist from KPMG on reorg 2.  12/11/2007 18:23 hrs Re NDTV Ltd re organization preliminary views on an alternative structure Meeting for reorg 3.  12/04/2008 12:43 hrs Re Indian Demerger Discussion on announcement on exchanges 4.  15/04/2008 16:55 hrs Resolution Stock Exchange Release for Demerger (Vertical Splits) Announcement on exchanges 5.  16/04/2008 Disclosure of PSI-6 by the Company to the Stock Exchanges   6.  17/04/2008 18:26 hrs Fw Structures discussed yesterday Discussion on freezing of final structure 7.  28/04/2008 21:34 hrs Fw restructuring Mail from NBCU regarding restructuring  (d) The table above indicates that the discussions pertaining to reorganisation of the Company which are germane to the creation of PSI-6 started on September 07, 2007. Thereafter, the disclosure was made by the Company to the Stock Exchanges on April 16, 2008. The Stock Exchanges disseminated the disclosure to the public on April 16, 2008 (at 16:13:09 on NSE and at 17:45:31 on BSE). Hence, the UPSI period for PSI-6 is to be taken as commencing from September 07, 2007 to April 16, 2008.  (e) Incidentally, the UPSI period pertaining to PSI-6 also covers the UPSI period pertaining to the quarterly financial results announcements by the Company for the quarters ending on September 30, 2007, December 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008.  (4) Considering the afore-stated contents, corporate objectives, focus and implication of the PSI-6 for the business plan of the Company, if the said PSI-6 was published before  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 2 Entities                                       Page 5 of 90  its disclosure to the stock exchanges, it would have materially affected the market price of the securities of NDTV.  (5) NDTV vide its reply dated October 12, 2015, has submitted a list of seven entities/persons who were involved in the discussions connected to the six PSIs. It is noted therefrom that Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy were involved in the discussions pertaining all the PSIs, including PSI-6, which undeniably bring Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy within the fold of \\\\\\\\u2018insiders\\\\\\\\u2019 in terms of regulation 2(e) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  (6) As per the information received from the stock exchanges, the trading pattern and trading details of Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy (in both NSE and BSE) during the Investigation Period are tabulated as below:  Name  Trade Date UPSI period pertaining to  Buy Quantity Sell Quantity Buy Value (\\\\\\\\u20b9) Sell Value (\\\\\\\\u20b9) Average Buy Price (\\\\\\\\u20b9) Average Sell Price (\\\\\\\\u20b9) A B C D F = C/A G=D/B  Prannoy Roy 26/12/2007 PSI-6 4835850 0 1934340000 0 400.00 0.00 17/04/2008 - 0 2410417 0 1048772437 0.00 435.10 03/06/2008 - 0 150 0 65265 0.00 435.10 19/06/2008 - 0 1250000 0 565312500 0.00 452.25 Prannoy Roy Total 4835850 3660567 1934340000 1614150202 400.00 440.82 Radhika Roy 17/04/2008 - 0 2503259 0 1089167991 0.00 435.10 Radhika Roy Total 0 2503259 0 1089167991 0.00 435.10  (7) The table above reveals that Mr. Prannoy Roy had bought 48,35,850 shares of NDTV on December 26, 2007. It is observed that 48,35,850 shares were credited on December 28, 2007 to a DP Account (DP id: 12029900 & Client id: 05474471) held jointly by Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy. Thus, Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy had together bought 48,35,850 shares of NDTV on December 26, 2007.  (8) The PSI-6 had come into existence on September 07, 2007 and it was published post trading hours on April 16, 2008. Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy, being insiders, had traded on December 26, 2007 by buying in NDTV shares during the UPSI period relevant to PSI-6.   (9) Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy had together bought 48,35,850 NDTV shares on December 26, 2007 at the rate of \\\\\\\\u20b9400 per share. Subsequently, Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy had sold 24,10,417 and 25,03,259 shares respectively on April 17, 2008 at 10:26:42 at the rate of \\\\\\\\u20b9435.10 per share. The gain made by Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy on the total number of shares jointly purchased by them during the UPSI period has been determined as below:  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 2 Entities                                       Page 6 of 90  Name Buy Quantity during UPSI period pertaining to PSI-6 Actual sell price on April 17, 2008 (\\\\\\\\u20b9) Actual buy price on December 26, 2007 (\\\\\\\\u20b9) Gain (\\\\\\\\u20b9) # A B C (B-C) x A Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy 4835850 435.1 400 169738335  # Gain = (Actual sell price - Actual buy price) x Number of shares bought during UPSI period  (10) Therefore, by making the aforesaid sales of Company\\\\\\\\u2019s shares held by them, Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy have together received a gain of \\\\\\\\u20b916.97 crores for themselves.  (11) Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 mandates all listed companies to frame a code of internal procedures and conduct in alignment with the Model Code specified in Schedule I of the PIT Regulations, 1992 [without diluting the regulations  in any manner and ensuring compliance with the same]. Regulation 12(2) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 warrants that all listed companies shall abide by the code of Corporate Disclosure Practices as specified in Schedule II of these Regulations.  (12) NDTV, in its reply dated June 22, 2015 has submitted the \\\\\\\\u2018Code of conduct for Prevention of Insider Trading\\\\\\\\u2019 (Code of conduct) as adopted by NDTV in terms of the above stated model code specified in Schedule I of the PIT Regulations, 1992 that was in force during the Investigation Period. It is observed that as per the clause 3.2.2 and clause 3.2.4 of the Model Code specified in the Schedule I of the PIT Regulations, 1992, when trading window is closed, employees/ directors shall not trade in company's shares and the trading window shall be opened 24 hours after the UPSI was made public. NDTV in its own code of conduct had also specified an identical stipulation for its employees and insiders.  (13) In the instant matter, the PSI-6 was published post trading hours on April 16, 2008, by way of disclosure to the stock exchange. Consequently, the trading window was required to be closed upto April 17, 2008 (till 24 hours after the UPSI was made public). NDTV in its reply dated October 12, 2015, has also submitted that the trading window for April 16, 2008 announcement was closed upto April 17, 2008.   (14) The announcement pertaining to PSI-6 was published post trading hours on April 16, 2008 at 16:13:09 on NSE and at 17:45:31 on BSE. However, Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy sold 24,10,417 and 25,03,259 shares, respectively on April 17, 2007 at 10:26:42. Therefore, Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy executed the aforesaid sale  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 2 Entities                                       Page 7 of 90  on April 17, 2008, during the period when the trading window for them was closed, i.e., within 24 hours of the public announcement pertaining to PSI-6 on April 16, 2008.  3. On the basis of the afore-stated findings from the investigation, a common show cause notice (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) dated August 31, 2018 was issued to Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy (hereinafter individually referred to by their respective names and collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d). The salient aspects thereof are as under:  (a) That Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy were insiders in terms of regulation 2(e) of the PIT Regulations, 1992;   (b) That Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy indulged in the act of insider trading by trading in the scrip of NDTV while in possession of UPSI relating to the proposed reorganization of the Company, which included a possible de-merger/ split of the Company into News related businesses and investments in \\\\\\\\u2018Beyond News\\\\\\\\u2019 businesses with an  objective of unlocking shareholder value and to promote focused growth of Company\\\\\\\\u2019s various businesses and therefore, have violated the provision of sections 12A(d) and (e) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3(i) and 4 of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  (c) That Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy sold their shares of NDTV on April 17, 2008, during trading window closure period, i.e., within 24 hours of the public announcement pertaining to PSI-6 on April 16, 2008 and as such have violated NDTV's Code of Conduct and the provisions of regulation 12(2) read with regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  (d) That Mr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy together have made a wrongful gain of \\\\\\\\u20b916.97 crores by trading in the shares NDTV while in possession of UPSI relating to the reorganization of the Company.  4. Accordingly, the Noticees were advised to show cause as to why suitable directions undersection 11(1), 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992, including direction for disgorgement of illegal gains, be not issued to them in view of the aforementioned alleged violations of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the PIT Regulations, 1992. The Noticees were also advised to submit their reply, if any, within 21 days of the receipt of the SCN failing which it would be construed that the Noticees have no reply to submit and SEBI would be free to take action against them on the basis of material available on record, in terms of the SEBI Act, 1992 and other laws as applicable.  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 2 Entities                                       Page 8 of 90  5. It is worth mentioning here that the PIT Regulations, 1992, have been repealed by the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015. Regulation 12 of the Regulations, 2015, provides as under:   \\\\\\\\u201cRepeal and Savings. 12.(1) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 are hereby repealed.   (2) Notwithstanding such repeal, \\\\\\\\u2014   (a) the previous operation of the repealed regulations or anything duly done or suffered thereunder, any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the repealed regulations, any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against the repealed regulations, or any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid, shall remain unaffected as if the repealed regulations had never been repealed;   (b)anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken including any adjudication, enquiry or investigation commenced or show-cause notice issued under the repealed regulations prior to such repeal, shall be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of these regulations;   (3) After the repeal of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992, any reference thereto in any other regulations made, guidelines or circulars issued thereunder by the Board shall be deemed to be a reference to the corresponding provisions of these regulations.\\\\\\\\u201d  6. As a result, any proceedings initiated for contraventions of provisions of the PIT Regulations, 1992 are saved and, hence, can be proceeded with under the said PIT Regulations, 1992. Considering the foregoing, the instant proceedings initiated against the Noticees for their alleged violations of provisions of the PIT Regulations, 1992 can very well be continued as such.  7. I note from the records that the Noticees did not file any reply to the SCN within the time prescribed therein. In fact, after receiving the SCN, the Noticees had sought inspection of documents and in compliance with the principles of natural justice, inspection of all the documents pertaining to and relied upon in the SCN were provided to the Noticees on October 30, 2018. Thereafter, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticees on July 10, 2019. On that day, Mr. Pawan Sharma (Advocate) from M/s DMD Advocates, appeared before me as the Authorized Representative of the Noticees and sought an adjournment in the matter citing some misunderstanding/communication on his part  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 2 Entities                                       Page 9 of 90  with their Senior Counsel. His request for an adjournment of the proceedings was considered. Mr. Pawan Sharma was advised to file a reply on behalf of the Noticees in response to the SCN as the same had not been filed even after completing inspection of documents 8 months ago. The said Authorized Representative of the Noticees assured that the requisite reply would be filed within two weeks from the date of the said personal hearing, i.e., July 10, 2019. Thereafter, vide a letter dated July 31, 2019, a written reply to the SCN was filed by M/s DMD Advocates on behalf of the Noticees who sought liberty to make  further submissions on facts and law at the time of next personal hearing. The Noticees also undertook to file separately the copies of documents relied upon  in support of their case.   8. Accordingly, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticees on September 26, 2019. On the said date, advocates Ms. Fereshte Sethna, alongwith Mr. Adhiraj Malhotra from M/s DMD Advocates, appeared as the Ld. Authorized Representatives of the Noticees and submitted a letter seeking, inter alia, another inspection of documents. It is worthwhile to mention here that no such objection or request for inspection was made by/on behalf of the Noticees on the previous date of hearing, i.e., July 10, 2019. Nevertheless, in the interest of principles of natural justice, the request for a 2nd round inspection of documents was granted to the Noticees. While allowing inspection of documents, I was guided by the order dated August 29, 2018, passed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in Writ Petition No. 9114/2018 - RRPR Holdings Pvt. Ltd. vs. SEBI- filed by one of the promoters of NDTV (RRPR Holdings Ltd. is jointly promoted by the Noticees herein) in respect of another matter pending before SEBI. In the aforesaid order, on the issue of inspection of documents, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court had observed as under:  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026.The SEBI shall insure the inspection of materials that have been investigated pertaining to the show cause notice, which is the subject matter of investigation, is provided. However, if there is any confidential material concerning a third party, which too might be under investigation or other confidential material, which the SEBI feels would be prejudicial, it is open to it segregate or detag such material while complying with the order.\\\\\\\\u201d  9. The Ld. Authorized Representatives were, accordingly, advised to confine their inspection of documents as per the directions of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court. Accordingly, they undertook to take the inspection on September 27, 2019. The Ld. Authorized Representatives were also asked to file additional reply, if any, by October 25, 2019 and with their consent, the personal hearing was rescheduled on November 13, 2019. From a perusal of the records before me, I note that the Ld. Authorized Representatives of the Noticees inspected the relevant documents on the scheduled date, however, vide email dated October 24, 2019, they requested for an extension of time for filing their additional reply by approximately two more weeks in view of the Diwali holidays. It was also requested by  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 2 Entities                                       Page 10 of 90  them to reschedule the personal hearing date from November 13, 2019 to November 22, 2019 or to some other date as per mutual convenience owing to some overseas engagement of their Counsel appearing on behalf of the Noticees. Considering the foregoing requests, personal hearing qua the Noticees was again shifted to November 25, 2019 and the same was duly communicated to them.  10. However, vide email dated November 05, 2019, the Ld. Authorized Representatives of the Noticees again sought extension of time to file additional reply in the matter. They contended that inspection of documents  remained incomplete and that full and fair inspection of all documents and/or material collected by SEBI during the course of investigation be granted to them, including but not limited to internal file noting, orders/directions and statements recorded, if any, after which the Noticees would file an additional reply. The Ld. Authorized Representatives requested to schedule the remainder inspection at the earliest.   11. I note from the records before me that inspection of all the annexures to the SCN and documents relevant to the Noticees as well as relied upon in the SCN issued to them, had already been given to the Noticees on October 30, 2018, itself when they conducted their first inspection and only after completion of inspection of the documents, personal hearing was granted to the Noticees on July 10, 2019. As stated earlier, on the said date of personal hearing the Ld. Authorized Representative of the Noticees appeared and sought adjournment in the matter on account of some misunderstanding/communication gap between him and their Counsel briefed in the matter. He did not raise any objection or put forth any issues regarding deficiency in the inspection that had already been completed on behalf of the Noticees on October 30, 2018. Accordingly, the request made by the Counsel was considered sympathetically and the personal hearing was adjourned to a mutually convenient date. Again on the next date of personal hearing, i.e., September 26, 2019, the Ld. Authorized Representatives sought inspection of documents, i.e., nearly 11 months after the 1st inspection of documents was conducted by them. However, respecting the principles of natural justice, one more opportunity to conduct inspection was granted on September 27, 2019 and in conformity with the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court (supra), the Ld. Authorized Representatives were permitted to inspect the relevant parts of the Investigation Report which are relevant to the case of the Noticees and documents that have been relied upon by SEBI in the SCN. They were also provided with the copies of those relevant parts of the Investigation Report including the annexures to the SCN.  12. In this regard, it needs to be noted that the investigation report is nothing but a compilation of all the factual findings made during the investigation which are comprehensively reproduced. The materials relied upon during investigation or the relevant extracts thereof are incorporated into the investigation report either in the body of the report or as annexures thereto. In the present case, relevant extracts of the investigation report  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 2 Entities                                       Page 11 of 90  pertaining to the Noticees alongwith all the annexures thereof have been provided to the Noticees alongwith the SCN. Considering the same, the request of the Ld. Authorized Representatives seeking inspection of various non-relevant and extraneous documents (internal file noting, orders/directions and statements recorded if any, etc.), that have not been relied upon in the SCN for framing charges against the Noticees and again, after eleven months of conducting their first inspection and one month after conducting the second round of inspection, in my opinion, has to be perceived as nothing but a delaying tactic which cannot be entertained. After having inspected and received the copies of all the documents that have been relied upon in the SCN in support of the allegations made therein and in the absence of any plausible explanation as to how non-inspection of those documents/materials which have no bearing with the allegations made in the SCN (i.e. non-relevant portions of investigation report, internal file noting or statements of third parties recorded, if any, which have not been referred to in the SCN) would prejudice the case of the Noticees in the present proceedings, it was not possible to accede to such  untenable demands for inspection. Therefore, the next date for personal hearing was fixed on December 13, 2019.  13. On December 13, 2019, the Ld. Authorized Representatives appeared and informed that the Noticees had filed a Writ Petition bearing number 3581/2019 (\\\\\\\\u2018Dr. Prannoy Roy & Anr. vs SEBI & Anr.\\\\\\\\u2019) before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Bombay High Court challenging the SCN and, therefore, a short adjournment may be granted. It was conveyed to the Ld. Authorized Representatives of the Noticees that the SCN in the instant case was issued on August 31, 2018 and since then, the proceedings have been progressing at a very slow pace due to frequent adjournments of personal hearing granted to them especially between July 2019 to December 2019. Even on the last occasion, it was quite clearly conveyed to the Noticees that no further adjournment would be granted in the matter and after consulting them a final hearing was fixed for final hearing on December 13, 2019. However, the Ld. Authorized Representatives persisted with their request. It was clarified to them that mere filing of a writ petition cannot be a ground for further postponement of the proceedings/hearing unless directed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court. Nevertheless, looking at their emphatic requests, the personal hearing had to be adjourned and with the consent of the Ld. Authorized Representatives the same was scheduled finally on January 03, 2020.  14. On January 03, 2020, the Ld. Authorized Representatives of the Noticees appeared and apart from making a detailed oral submission before me, tendered a copy of their written submission in the matter to me. After hearing them personally and after a careful perusal of their written submission, I would now summarize the explanations offered and arguments advanced by the Noticees as under:  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 2 Entities                                       Page 12 of 90  (a) On October 30, 2018 inspection of the documents and records,  pertaining to the SCN was provided. However, as recorded in the Minutes pertaining thereto, inspection of the Investigation Report, internal notings and orders, etc. was not provided.  (b) On September 26, 2019, the requirement for grant of full and fair inspection of all material including the Investigation Report, statements, notings and orders, etc. was reiterated on the basis of which another inspection was granted on September 27, 2019, during which a heavily redacted investigation report was provided to them.     (c) The adjudication in this case is being conducted, inter alia, under the PIT Regulations, 1992 and the materials required to sustain such an adjudication for which grant of inspection is imperative, are:  (i) Copy of notice that was required to be provided to the Noticees in compliance of regulation 6(1) of the Regulations failing which the adjudication proceedings would be unsustainable by virtue of being vitiated by fundamental procedural irregularity; or  (ii) Copy of an order in terms of regulation 6(2) of the Regulations, if any, in the event a notice under regulation 6(1) was not issued.  (iii) Copy of the investigation report in terms of regulation 9(1) of the Regulations.  (d) With the delivery of a heavily redacted investigation report, it is evident that the material information is being withheld from the Noticees. It is also significant that such a heavily redacted report was furnished thirteen months after the SCN was issued.  (e) It is the case of the Noticees that no gain was made, much less wrongful gain, in relation to the transaction of sale of NDTV shares on April 17, 2008. The Noticees had availed a loan and purchased 48,35,850 equity shares from GA Global Investments Ltd. (at an average price of \\\\\\\\u20b9400/- per equity share) on December 26, 2007.   (f) Following the purchase transactions with GA Global Investments Ltd. which triggered an open offer, the Noticees were constrained to substantially avail loans to fulfill their obligations under the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Takeover Regulations, 1997\\\\\\\\u201d). The Public Announcements, Letter of Offer and Post Offer Public Announcement, establish inter alia the basis on which the price of \\\\\\\\u20b9438.98/- per share was arrived at. The Noticees then purchased 1,26,90,257 equity shares of NDTV in the Open Offer.

G. Export Industries Limited  In the matter of Non-Redressal of investor complaints on SCORES  ___________________________________________________________________ FACTS OF THE CASE IN BRIEF 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter, SEBI) vide Circular No. CIR/OIAE/2/2011 dated June 03, 2011, directed all listed companies to obtain SEBI Complaints Redressal System (hereinafter, SCORES) authentication and also redress any pending investor grievances in that platform only. Subsequently, SEBI also vide Circulars No CIR/OIAE/1/2012 dated August 13, 2012, No. CIR/OIAE/1/2013 dated April 17, 2013 and No CIR/OIAE/1/2014 dated December 18, 2014, (hereinafter, SEBI circulars) inter-alia directed all companies whose securities were listed on stock exchanges to obtain SCORES authentication within a period of 30 days from the date of issue of this circular and also to redress the pending investor grievances within the stipulated time period. 2. It was alleged that N. G. Export Industries Limited (hereinafter, Noticee/Company) had failed to obtain the SCORES authentication, to redress investor grievances pending therein and to submit the Action Taken Reports within the timelines stipulated by SEBI, therefore not complying with the aforesaid SEBI Circulars.Adjudication Order in respect of N. G. Export Industries Limited                                                                              Page 2 of 9        APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  3. The undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer (\\\\\\\\u2018AO\\\\\\\\u2019) vide order dated June 12, 2019, under Section 19 read with Section 15-I of Securities and Exchange Board of India, 1992 (hereinafter, \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and under Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter, Rules) to enquire into and adjudge under Section 15HB and Section 15C of the SEBI Act, for the aforementioned alleged violations by the Noticee. Earlier, the case was assigned to Shri Sudeep Mishra, Shri Achal Singh and Shri Anindhya K. Das. I therefore proceed in the matter from where it had been left by the previous Adjudicating Officer.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 4. A Show Cause Notice dated September 10, 2014 (hereinafter, SCN) was issued by the erstwhile Adjudicating Officer to the Noticee under Rule 4 of the Rules, calling it to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against it in terms of Rule 4 of the Rules, read with Section 15-I of SEBI Act and penalty be not imposed on it under Section 15HB and Section 15C of the SEBI Act for allegedly failing to obtain  SCORES  authentication, to  redress  the  grievances of  the  investors pending therein, and  to submit  the  Action  Taken  report,  within  the  timelines specified by SEBI. However, the SCN returned undelivered with the reason \\\\\\\\u201cAddressee left\\\\\\\\u201d.  5. Subsequently, pursuant to the appointment of the undersigned as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, a copy of the aforesaid SCN dated September 10, 2014 was sent along with a notice of Personal Hearing dated September 18, 2020 vide digitally signed email dated September 18, 2020, to the Noticee.  The said notice of Personal Hearing dated September 18, 2020 provided an opportunity of personal hearing to the Noticee on October 07,2020. The said email containing SCN and Hearing Notice was duly delivered to the Noticee. However, the Noticee neither replied to the SCN nor did he appear for the Hearing.  However, the director of the company vide his email dated October 07, 2020 submitted that they are in home quarantine and he further requested to adjourn the hearing after 30 days soAdjudication Order in respect of N. G. Export Industries Limited                                                                              Page 3 of 9       that he can gather documents and produce before the undersigned.  Accordingly, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on October 23, 2020 and subsequently at his request, on November 4, 2020.  Thus in the interest of natural justice, the Noticee was granted sufficient opportunities of personal hearing.  Further, the Noticee was also given the option of appearing before the undersigned through video conferencing.  However, the Noticee failed to avail the opportunity of personal hearing granted to it as aforesaid.    6. It is pertinent to mention here that vide the aforesaid Hearing Notices, it was clearly indicated that in case of failure to appear before the undersigned, the case would be proceeded with ex-parte on the basis of the material available on record.  In spite of the same, and even after lapse of more than 2 months from the date of delivery of SCN, the Notice neither filed any reply to the SCN nor did he avail of the opportunities of personal hearing granted to it.   7. Considering the fact that the Noticee has not availed the opportunity of personal hearing despite being granted opportunities for the same and has not submitted any documents despite being granted additional time for the same, I am of the view that the Noticee has nothing more to submit, and in terms of rule 4(7) of the Rules, the matter can be proceeded ex-parte on the basis of material available on record.   ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS 8. Given the aforesaid, I proceed in the matter on the basis of the material available on records and the issues that arise for consideration in the present case are:  a. Whether the Noticee had failed to obtain the SCORES authentication and to redress investor grievances pending therein within the timelines stipulated by SEBI, thereby failed to comply with SEBI circulars dated June 03, 2011, August 13, 2012 and April 17, 2013?Adjudication Order in respect of N. G. Export Industries Limited                                                                              Page 4 of 9       b. Does the violation, if any, on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under Section 15 HB and 15 C of the SEBI Act? c. If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15 J of the SEBI Act?   9. While recording my finding, it is pertinent to have a brief narration on SCORES and its applicable circulars.  10. SEBI commenced its web based investor grievance redressal portal, SCORES, in June 2011 to enhance investor protection, enabling investors to lodge their complaint against listed companies either through \\\\\\\\u2018on-line\\\\\\\\u2019 or physical mode and thereafter monitor its status on 24 X 7 basis. Complaints received by SEBI / in SCORES are electronically forwarded to the listed company / its Share Transfer Agent (hereinafter, STA), which in turn is required to redress the same and furnish the ATR in electronic form. However, as a prerequisite to access SCORES portal, listed companies have to obtain user ID and login password from SEBI by providing specified information to the latter (hereinafter, \\\\\\\\u201cSCORES authentication\\\\\\\\u201d). The foregoing was spelt out in the SEBI Circular No. CIR/OIAE/2/2011 dated June 03, 2011 which also provided the format in its annexure, for listed companies to provide information to the former to obtain authentication.  11. SEBI circular No. CIR/OIAE/1/2012 dated August 13, 2012, inter-alia, reiterated the contents of the June 2011 circular and fixed September 14, 2012 as the last date for obtaining SCORES authentication. From the material available on records, I find that the Noticee had not obtained SCORES Authentication till date. Further, I note that the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Port Shipping Company Ltd. vs. SEBI (decided on April 29, 2015) observed that:  \\\\\\\\u201c...where  a listed  company  fails  to  obtain  SCORES  authentication  within  the  time  stipulated by  SEBI,  then  it  amounts  to  violating  the  directions  of  SEBI  and  in  such  a  case penalty is imposable under Section 15HB of SEBI Act...\\\\\\\\u201dAdjudication Order in respect of N. G. Export Industries Limited                                                                              Page 5 of 9       12. Redressal of investor grievances in SCORES is distinct from obtaining authentication. Accordingly, SEBI Circular No. CIR/OIAE/1/2013 dated April 17, 2013, inter-alia, reiterated the contents of June 2011 Circular and by way of standing order, \\\\\\\\u201ccalled upon\\\\\\\\u201d listed companies to redress investor grievances in SCORES within 30 days, thereby enabling SEBI to impose penalty u/s 15 C of SEBI Act in case of their failure to do so. Further, SEBI Circular No. CIR/OIAE/1/2014 dated December 18, 2014, inter-alia, extended SCORES platform to specified intermediaries, and also called upon \\\\\\\\u2018newly listed companies\\\\\\\\u2019 to redress investors\\\\\\\\u2019 grievances through this portal. Also, SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, notified on September 02, 2015 and came into force 90 days thereafter, subsumed the September 2012 Circular. 13. As already noted, bereft of authentication, redressal of investor grievance cannot happen in SCORES. In this regard, I find that despite SEBI forewarning the Noticee repeatedly through issue of various circulars and in letters in the matter, the Noticee which was a listed company at the relevant period of time did not pay heed to the same and consistently failed and neglected to comply with the SEBI Circulars for obtaining a Login ID and password till March 2014. Further, this proceeding was initiated, inter-alia, on the allegation that eighteen grievances of investor were pending for redressal at the time of issuing the SCN. From the material available on record, I observe that Noticee had failed to resolve grievances of fourteen investors till date. I observe that SEBI is inter alia entrusted with the task of ensuring speedy resolution of investor grievances and to achieve the same, SEBI has provided a centralized web portal viz. SCORES wherein unresolved grievances pertaining to securities market are registered. However, I note that the Noticee Company had consistently failed to comply with the provisions of SEBI Consolidated Circular CIR/OIAE/1/2014 dated December 18, 2014 for obtaining a Login ID and password within timeline. As already stated above, the Circular dated April 17, 2013 had inter alia stipulated that:  \\\\\\\\u201cFailure to obtain the SCORES user ID and password within 30 days of issue of this circular would not only be deemed as non redressal of investor grievances but also indicate wilful avoidance of the same.\\\\\\\\u201dAdjudication Order in respect of N. G. Export Industries Limited                                                                              Page 6 of 9       14. Thus, the aforesaid non-compliance to SEBI circulars dated August 13, 2012 and April 17, 2013 render the Noticee liable for penalty under section 15 C of the SEBI Act. 15. The provisions of section 15HB and 15C of the SEBI Act is reproduced herein below:  15HB - Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided  Whoever  fails  to  comply  with  any  provision  of  this  Act,  the  rules  or  the  regulations made  or  directions  issued  by  the  Board  thereunder  for  which  no  separate  penalty  has  been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which may extend to one crore rupees The penalty amount was amended as \\\\\\\\u201cliable to penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees, by the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014, w.e.f. 08-09-2014.  15C - Penalty for failure to redress investors\\\\\\\\u2019 grievances If  any  listed  company  or  any  person  who  is  registered  as  an  intermediary,  after  having been called upon by the Board in writing, to redress the grievances of investors, fails to redress such grievances within the time specified by the Board, such company or intermediary shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less.  The penalty amount was amended as \\\\\\\\u201cwhich shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees  for  each  day  during  which  such  failure  continues  subject  to  a  maximum  of  one crore rupees\\\\\\\\u201d, by the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014, w.e.f. 08-09-2014.  16. As per the dates of defaults, Section 15HB and 15C of SEBI Act, as they stood prior to their amendments, respectively, are applicable for not obtaining authentication and non redressal of grievance, respectively. Nevertheless, guided by the principle of rule of beneficial construction of even ex post facto law to mitigate the rigour of law, as was laid by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in T. Barai vs. Henry Ah Hoe and Ors. (07.12.1982 -SC): MANU/SC/0123/1982 -(1983)1SCC177, the amended version of section 15C of SEBI Act is applied for the investor grievance which was not redressed during the stipulated period of time.Adjudication Order in respect of N. G. Export Industries Limited                                                                              Page 7 of 9       17. While determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15 HB and Section 15C of SEBI Act as aforesaid, provisions of Section 15J of SEBI Act would be applicable, which read as under: - [Factors to be taken into account while adjudging quantum of penalty.] 15J. While adjudging quantum of penalty under 15-I or section 11 or section 11B, the Board or the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely: \\\\\\\\u2014 (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default. Explanation. \\\\\\\\u2014 For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E, clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.  18. With regard to the above factors to be considered while determining the quantum of penalty, it is noted that the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee or loss caused to the investors as a result of the failure on the part of the Noticee to redress the grievance and for filing the ATR with SEBI, are not available on record. As regards the repetitive nature of the default, as already observed, the Noticee had failed to obtained SCORES authentication till date and had also not redressed the pending grievance of fourteen investors within the timeline specified by SEBI. Such persistent non-compliance does not inspire confidence of investors in the market, whose protection is SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s prime mandate.  ORDER 19. After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, I impose a penalty of Rs. 1,00,000/-  under Section 15 HB of the SEBI Act and Rs. 1,00,000/- under sectionAdjudication Order in respect of N. G. Export Industries Limited                                                                              Page 8 of 9       15C of the SEBI Act, i.e.  penalties totaling to Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lacs) against N. G. Export Industries Limited, which will be commensurate with its non-compliances.     20. The Noticees shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR through online payment facility available on the website of SEBI, i.e. www.sebi.gov.in on the following path, by clicking on the payment link: ENFORCEMENT \\\\\\\\uf0e0 Orders \\\\\\\\uf0e0 Orders of AO \\\\\\\\uf0e0 PAY NOW.  21.

In respect of  Sai Prakash Properties Development Limited PAN: AANCS7178R  In the matter of Sai Prakash Properties Development Limited __________________________________________________________________ FACTS OF THE CASE 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) started investigation into the affairs of Sai Prakash Properties Development Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SPPDL/ Company\\\\\\\\u2019). During the course of investigation, the Investigating Authority of SEBI (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018IA\\\\\\\\u2019) issued summons under Sections 11C(3) of the SEBI Act to various entities including Sai Prakash Properties Development Limited (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee/ SPPDL/ by Name\\\\\\\\u201d) for production of documents. However, the Noticee failed to comply with the summons. In view of the same, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings under Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2019) against the Noticee.   APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 2. The undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer on dated March 14, 2019, under Section 15-I (1) of SEBI Act to inquire into and adjudge under the Page 2 of 10  provisions of Section 15A(a) for the violations of the provisions of Section 11C(3) of the SEBI Act. The appointment was communicated to the undersigned vide communique dated March 20, 2019.     SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING Show Cause Notice dated November 18, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee under the provisions of Rule 4(1) of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018AO Rules\\\\\\\\u2019), to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against the Noticee and why penalty, if any, should not be imposed on the Noticee under the provisions of Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act for the violations of the provisions of Section 11C(2) and 11C(3) of the SEBI Act.  3. The IA had called for providing complete list of Investors containing full name including father / husband name, address of the investor, date of bookings / payments, date of maturity, type of scheme, amount invested, maturity amount, details of investment, details of plan, details of branches, branch wise collection details, total amount collected since inception till date, details of agents, details of agent wise collection, details of all bank account, bank statement and any other information pertaining to fund mobilization by the Noticee. The above mentioned information was sought by issuing summons to the Noticee. Summons were issued on December 2, 2016, December 19, 2016 and January 16, 2017. However, these summons sent through registered post returned undelivered. Thereafter, two summons were issued on January 16, 2017, which were affixed at the two available addresses of the Noticee situated in Noida, on January 20 & 23, 2017. However, no information was submitted by the Noticee in response to summons. Page 3 of 10  4. The SCN was sent via Speed Post Acknowledgement Due (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SPAD\\\\\\\\u2019) to the last known address of the Noticee but the SCN returned undelivered. Thereafter, the SCN was served upon the Noticee through a Public Notice dated October 09, 2020, in terms of Rule 7 of AO Rules. The Noticee was advised to file his reply within 14 days of publication of the said Notice. In addition to that, vide aforesaid Public Notice, the Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing before the undersigned in the interest of natural justice. However, the Noticee failed to submit his reply to the SCN and did not attend the hearing on October 27, 2020. 5. In view of the above, I am compelled to proceed ex parte in the matter against the Noticee. I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been complied with since sufficient opportunity has been provided to the Noticee to submit reply and to appear for hearing. In the facts and circumstances of this case, I am of the view that the Noticee is keeping away from these proceedings and is not willing to cooperate. I, therefore, am of the view that the Noticee has nothing to submit and in terms of rule 4(7) of the Adjudication Rules the matter can be proceeded ex-parte on the basis of material available on record. Therefore, the present proceedings against the Noticee are undertaken ex-parte on the basis of available documents and information.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 6. I have carefully perused the documents / evidence available on record and the issues that arise for consideration in the present case are: (a) Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Sections 11C(2) and 11C(3) of the SEBI Act by his non-compliance of summons issued by IA? (b) Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act?  (c) If yes, what should be the quantum of penalty? Page 4 of 10  7. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of the SEBI Act: Investigation. 11C (1) \\\\\\\\u2026. (2) \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026 (3) The Investigating Authority may require any intermediary or any person associated with securities market in any manner to furnish such information to, or produce such books, or registers, or other documents, or record before him or any person authorised by it in this behalf as it may consider necessary if the furnishing of such information or the production of such books, or registers, or other documents, or record is relevant or necessary for the purposes of its investigation.  8. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the brief background of the matter. SEBI was in receipt of information regarding illegal money mobilization by SPPDL and in order to safeguard interest of investors, SEBI vide and interim Order dated December 26, 2014, directed SPPDL and its directors, which reads as under- a) not to collect any fresh moneys from investors from its existing scheme; b) not to launch any new scheme/plan or float any new companies/firm to raise fresh moneys; c) not to dispose of any of the properties or alienate the assets of the existing scheme; d) not to divert any funds raised from public at large, kept in bank account(s) and/ or in the custody of the company; e) to immediately submit the full inventory of the assets owned by Sai Prakash Properties out of the amounts collected from the \"customers\"/investors under its existing schemes; f) to furnish all the information sought by SEBI, within 15 days of the receipt of this Order, including, Page 5 of 10  i. scheme wise list of investors and their contact numbers and addresses, who have invested in the scheme till date, ii. the details of amount mobilized and refunded till date. 9. Subsequent to the aforesaid Interim Order, SEBI conducted an Investigation in the matter. During the course of investigation, IA issued Summons to the Noticee seeking information, however, as stated above the Noticee did not furnish the required information to IA.  10. As stated earlier, the summons dated December 2, 2016, December 19, 2016 and January 16, 2017 were undelivered. Then, the IA issued two summons dated January 16, 2017, to the Noticee which were duly affixed on last known addresses of the Noticee situated in Noida and were thus duly served. However, no information was served to the IA by the Noticee as sought in the summons.  11. Thus, I note that multiple attempts have been made to serve the summons to the Noticee. I observe from the available records that the IA had sought certain information by issuance of the said summons such as (i). Complete list of Investors containing full name including father / husband name, address of the investor; (ii). Date of bookings / payments, date of maturity, type of scheme, amount invested, maturity amount, details of investment; (iii). Copies of bank statements detailing the requirements, details of plan, details of branches, branch wise collection details, total amount collected since inception till date; (iv). details of agents, details of agent wise collection; (v). Details of all bank accounts maintained by the Noticee and any other information pertaining to fund mobilization by the Noticee. 12. As per records, I observe that the two summons dated January 16, 2017, were duly delivered to the Noticee through affixture. I observe that the Noticee was advised, vide the aforesaid summons referred above, to furnish the required information within one week of receipt of summons. It is observed from the records that the Investigation had to be concluded. I also find that it is mentioned Page 6 of 10  in the Investigation Report that due to non-submission of information by the Noticee the investigation was concluded on the basis of data available on the records and in absence of documents/ information sought from the Noticee.  13. In view of the above, I conclude that the Noticee has violated the provisions of Sections 11C(2) and 11C(3) of the SEBI Act by not complying with the summons. Any non-compliance of the summons of the Investigating Authority hampers the process of investigation. The Hon'ble SAT has also recognized the importance of compliance of summons and in the matter of DKG Buildcon Pvt. Ltd. v.  SEBI (Appeal No. 106 of 2006, Date of Decision: January 07, 2009), it has held that: \"...It is of utmost importance that every person from whom information is sought should fully co-operate with the investigating officer and promptly produce all documents, records, information as may be necessary for the investigations. If persons are allowed to flout the summons issued to them during the course of the investigations, the Board as the watchdog of the securities market will not be able to perform its duties in protecting the interests of the investors and safeguarding the integrity of the securities market.\" Thus, it is well established that timely submission of information is very important for the purpose of effective investigation proceedings and non-cooperation by an entity can be detrimental to the interest of investors and the securities market on account of delay or hindrance in the investigation. The Hon'ble SAT in the Mayfair Paper & Board Pvt. Ltd. v. SEBI (Appeal No. 95 of 2004, Date of Decision: August 09, 2004) has held that failure to furnish information to the Investigating Authority of SEBI shall attract the penalty prescribed under Section 15A of the SEBI Act.  14. As stated above, I note that sufficient opportunities were granted to the Noticee to submit his reply to the SCN and to appear for personal hearing. However, despite service of the SCN and hearing notice, none of the given opportunities were availed of by the Noticee. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Classic Credit Page 7 of 10  Ltd. v. SEBI [2007] 76 SCL 51 (SAT - MUM) inter alia held that \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201cthe appellants did not file any reply to the second show-cause notice. This being so, it has to be presumed that the charges alleged against them in the show-cause notice were admitted by them\\\\\\\\u201d. The Hon'ble SAT also made such proposition in case of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Ors. v. SEBI (in appeal No. 68/2013) decided on February 11, 2014 viz. \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted charges levelled against them in the show cause notices\\\\\\\\u201d.  15. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI v. Shriram Mutual Fund [2006] 68 SCL 216(SC) has observed that \" In our considered opinion, penalty is attracted as soon as the contravention of the statutory obligation as contemplated by the Act and the Regulations is established and hence the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes wholly irrelevant....\". In view of the same, I find that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s failure to comply with the summons attracts penalty under section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act.  16. In view of the above, the next issue for consideration is as to what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed under section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act on the Noticee for the violation of Sections 11C(3) of the SEBI Act. The relevant text of the provisions of Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act are reproduced as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cPenalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. 15A.If   any   person, who   is   required   under   this   Act   or   any   rules   or   regulations   made thereunder, - (a) to furnish any document, return or report to the Board, fails to furnish the same, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh Page 8 of 10  rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees.\\\\\\\\u201d  17. While determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act, it is important to consider the factors relevantly as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under:  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer.  Section 15J - While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely: - (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  Explanation. \\\\\\\\u2014For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E, clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.  18. In the instant matter, it is not possible to quantify the gains made by the Noticee or the loss caused to investors as a result of the failure on the part of the Noticee to honour the summons. Further, I note that SEBI vide interim order dated December 26, 2014 had already directed the Noticee to furnish certain information including the details sought by the Investigating Authority. It is apparent from the records that the Noticee has failed to comply with two Summons dated January 16, 2017. However, I observe that the Noticee's failure to furnish required information to the Investigating Authority reflects the Page 9 of 10  Noticee's disregard for the investigation process of SEBI and the same needs to be viewed seriously. Accordingly, appropriate penalty needs to be levied on the Noticee to act as a deterrent.  ORDER 19. Having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, the material available on record, the submissions made by the Noticee and also the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby impose a penalty of \\\\\\\\u20b9 2,00,000 (Rupees Two Lakh only) on the Noticee viz. Sai Prakash Properties Development Limited under the provisions of Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act. I am of the view that the said penalty is commensurate with the lapse/omission on the part of the Noticee.  20. I am of the view that the said penalty is commensurate with the lapse/omission on the part of the Noticee. The Noticee shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order, either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR by using the web link https://siportal.sebi.gov.in/intermediary/AOPaymentGateway.html  21. The Noticee shall forward said Demand Draft or the details / confirmation of penalty so paid to the Enforcement Department \\\\\\\\u2013 Division of Regulatory Action\\\\\\\\u2013 III of SEBI. The Noticee shall provide the following details while forwarding the Demand Draft: i. Name and PAN of the entity (Noticee) ii. Name of the case / matter iii. Purpose of Payment \\\\\\\\u2013 Payment of penalty under AO proceedings iv. Bank Name and Account Number  v. Transaction Number Page 10 of 10  22. In the event of failure to pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of the receipt of this Order, recovery proceedings may be initiated under section 28A of the SEBI Act for realization of the said amount of penalty along with interest thereon, inter alia, by attachment and sale of movable and immovable properties.  23. Copies of this Adjudication Order are being sent to the Noticee and also to SEBI in terms of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules.

Vide the said SCN, the Noticees were called upon to show cause as to why directions under section 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992, including directions for disgorgement of illegal gains against Noticees No. 2 to 5, be not issued against them for the aforementioned alleged violations of the SEBI Act, 1992 and provisions of the PIT Regulations, 1992. The SCN issued to the Noticees, also contained the copies of documents relied upon in the SCN.  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 5 Entities                                      Page 2 of 72  2. It is noted that the instant SCN has been issued pursuant to an investigation conducted by SEBI, which got triggered on account of receipt of certain complaints from NDTV on July 16, 2013 (1st complaint), December 27, 2013 (2nd complaint) and January 9, 2014 (3rd complaint) inter alia alleging that Mr. Sanjay Dutt and certain related entities viz. QSPL and SREPL were involved in dealing in securities of NDTV in violation of provision of the PIT Regulations, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d during the period September 2006 to June 2008 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201c Investigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d). Facts unearthed during the investigation and iterated in the SCN are enumerated in brief herein below for easy reference:   (1) During the Investigation Period, the price of NDTV scrip increased from \\\\\\\\u20b9195 to \\\\\\\\u20b9379.55 at NSE, thereby registering an increase in the market price of NDTV scrip by 94.64%. Similar trend was observed at BSE also.   (2) As per Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated September 01, 2006 and Agreement dated July 01, 2007 (collectively referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cConsultancy Agreements\\\\\\\\u201d) between NDTV and Mr. Sanjay Dutt, Noticee No. 1 was an \\\\\\\\u201con call and in house\\\\\\\\u201d advisor/team member of NDTV group.   (3) In terms of the Consultancy Agreements, it was observed that the scope of work of Sanjay Dutt included \\\\\\\\u201ccomplete responsibility and accountability for the Corporate Finance and Strategic Planning function\\\\\\\\u201d of the Company including designing and charting implementation strategies to enhance corporate value, while reducing/ optimizing financial risks, assist internal teams in areas so as to maximize the company's return to capital, assist and implement investment banking and project evaluation decisions.   (4) Further, his responsibilities included evolving a corporate structure to meet the expansion of the Company; raising funds for existing and new business of the Company; working as part of the internal strategic group and as a liaison for potential partners and allies.  (5) The terms of Consultancy Agreement, made Mr. Sanjay Dutt to be responsible and accountable for the Corporate Finance and Strategic Planning function of NDTV and brought him within the principle of a connected person in terms of regulation 2(c)(ii) of the PIT Regulations, 1992, by virtue of his engagement with NDTV in terms of the said Consultancy Agreements.  (6) As per the e-mail correspondences submitted by NDTV, Mr. Sanjay Dutt was a part of the strategic team behind the decisions, which were of price sensitive nature and which were unpublished. From the same, it is also noticed that Mr. Sanjay Dutt was directly involved in the discussions pertaining to vital business strategies and business re-  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 5 Entities                                      Page 3 of 72  organisation of the Company. The investigation also noticed that Mr. Sanjay Dutt used to be a part of a mail group within the Company with whom unpublished price sensitive information of the Company were being shared, which further showed that Mr. Sanjay Dutt had direct access to and was in possession of unpublished price sensitive information of NDTV during his tenure of association with NDTV. In view of the foregoing, Mr. Sanjay Dutt was falling in the category of an insider in terms of regulation 2(e)(i) and 2(e)(ii) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.   (7) Further, the remaining four entities, i.e., Noticees No. 2 to 5, are related to Noticee No. 1 since Noticee No. 2 is wife of Noticee No. 1, Noticee No. 3 is a company in which Noticee No. 1 is a Director/Promoter, Noticee No. 4 is a company in which Noticee No. 2 is a Director/Promoter and Noticee No. 5 is a company in which Noticee No. 1 is also a Director/Promoter.  Mrs. Prenita Dutt \\\\\\\\u2013  (8) Noticee No. 2 is married to Noticee No. 1. Noticee No. 2 is also a director in Noticee No. 4. Noticee No. 2 had also traded in the shares of NDTV during the Investigation Period. Noticee No. 2, being wife of Noticee No. 1, is a relative of Noticee No.1 and a \\\\\\\\u2018connected person\\\\\\\\u2019 in terms of regulation 2(h)(viii) of the PIT Regulations, 1992. Further, Noticee No. 2 being wife of Noticee No. 1 was reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information. Therefore, Noticee No. 2 was apparently an \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of regulation 2(e)(i) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 read with regulation 2(h)(viii) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 during the relevant period.  QSPL -    (9) Noticee No. 1 and his brother are promoters of Noticee No. 3 and are also its directors. As per annual returns filed with MCA by Noticee No. 3, Noticee No. 1 and his brother were each holding 16.78% of the paid up share capital of Noticee No. 3 during the Investigation Period, details of which are as presented below:  Table No. 1: Shareholding of Sanjay Dutt in QSPL  Particulars As per the Annual return filed. Shareholding as on September 30, 2005 As per the Annual return filed. Shareholding as on September 30, 2008 As per the Annual return filed.

Further, Noticee No. 3 by virtue of its connection with the Noticee No. 1 (an insider) being its promoter and director, also was reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information. Therefore, it appears that Noticee No. 3 was also an \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of regulation 2(e)(i) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 read with regulation 2(h)(ix) of the Regulations during the relevant period.  SREPL \\\\\\\\u2013   (11) Noticee No. 2 and Mrs. Neenu Dutt (sister-in-law of Noticee No. 1) are promoters and directors of Noticee No. 4. As per annual returns filed with MCA by Noticee No. 4, Noticee No. 2 and Mrs. Neenu Dutt each were holding 50% of the paid up share capital of Noticee No. 4 during the Investigation Period.  (12) Noticee No. 2 (i.e., the connected person of Noticee No.1) held more than 10% of the shareholding of Noticee No. 4, hence Noticee No. 4 is deemed to be a connected person in terms of regulation 2(h)(ix) of the PIT Regulations, 1992. Further, Noticee No. 4 was reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information since Noticee No. 2 (an insider) was a promoter and director of Noticee No. 4. Therefore, it appears that Noticee No. 4 was an \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of regulation 2(e)(i) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 read with regulation 2(h)(ix) of the Regulations at the given point of time.  TCPPL \\\\\\\\u2013   (13) Noticee No. 1 is a promoter and director of Noticee No. 5. As per annual returns filed with MCA by Noticee No. 5, Noticee No. 1 was holding from 25% to 50% of the paid up share capital of Noticee No. 5 during the Investigation Period, the details of which are presented below:  Table No. 2: Shareholding of Sanjay Dutt in TCPPL  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 5 Entities                                      Page 5 of 72  Particulars As per the Annual return filed. Shareholding as on September 30, 2006 As per the Annual return filed. Shareholding as on September 29, 2007 As per the Annual return filed. Shareholding as on September 15, 2008 Number of shares % of Total Number of shares % of Total Number of shares % of Total Sanjay Dutt 10000 50 5000 25 6667 33.34% Company\\\\\\\\u2019s total 20000 100 20000 100 20000 100  (14) Since Noticee No. 1 held more than 10% of the shareholding of Noticee No. 5, Noticee No. 5 is deemed to be a connected person in terms of regulation 2(h)(ix) of the PIT Regulations, 1992. Noticee No. 5 was also reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information since Noticee No. 1 (an insider) was the promoter and director of Noticee No. 5. Therefore, Noticee No. 5 appears to be an \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of regulation 2(e)(i) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 read with regulation 2(h)(ix) of the Regulations during the investigation period.  (15) Keeping the aforesaid factual details and legal provisions, all the Noticees apparently  fall under the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cconnected person\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d with respect to NDTV in terms of regulation 2(c) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 and regulation 2(e) of the Regulations, respectively.  (16) Information pertaining to corporate announcements of NDTV were gathered from NDTV and stock exchanges. As per the disclosure made by the Company (NDTV) to the Stock Exchanges and also furnished in their replies to SEBI, there had been six (6) price sensitive information (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPSI\\\\\\\\u201d) during the Investigation Period, which are as detailed below:  Table No. 3: Details of PSI(s)  PSI Start date of UPSI  Date & time when the PSI was disclosed on exchange website UPSI period PSI-1: Expansion of the company in areas beyond news to develop NDTV into a bouquet of channels with entertainment and lifestyle and initiate a major thrust in New Media including the internet.

Hence Noticees No. 2 to 5 by their act of buying and selling shares of NDTV have \\\\\\\\u201cdealt in securities\\\\\\\\u201d of the Company in terms of regulation 2(d) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  (20) In view of the fact that Noticee No. 1 was an insider and Noticees No. 2 to 5 are \\\\\\\\u201cconnected persons\\\\\\\\u201d of the \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d with respect to NDTV in terms of regulation 2(c) and regulation 2(e) of the PIT Regulations, 1992, respectively, Noticees No. 2 to 5 were reasonably expected to have access to the PSIs during the UPSI period in respect of securities of NDTV.   (21) Further, the surrounding events and the acts of Noticees No. 2 to 5 in dealing in NDTV shares during UPSI period pertaining to PSIs 1 to 6 and there also being a substantial increase in the trading quantities of Noticees No. 2 to 5 in NDTV shares during the association of Noticee No. 1 with NDTV, indicate that Noticees No. 2 to 5 were in possession of the unpublished price sensitive information by accessing them  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 5 Entities                                      Page 8 of 72  from/through Noticee No. 1 and that they have dealt in securities of NDTV, during the period, while in possession of those UPSI.  (22) Regulation 3(i) of the PIT Regulations, 1992, inter alia, prohibits an insider, either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, from dealing in securities of a company listed on any Stock Exchange, when he is in possession of any UPSI. Further, regulation 3(ii) of the PIT Regulations, 1992, inter alia, prohibits an insider from communicating directly or indirectly any UPSI to any person who, while in possession of such UPSI, shall not deal in securities. Further, in terms of regulation 4 of the PIT Regulations, 1992 any insider who deals in securities in contravention of regulation 3 is said to be guilty of insider trading.  (23) It was observed that Noticees No. 2 to 5, by dealing in securities of NDTV while in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, have allegedly violated the provisions of section 12A(d), (e) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulation 3(i) and regulation 4 of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  (24) It is further observed that Noticee No. 1, by directly or indirectly communicating unpublished price sensitive information to Noticees No. 2 to 5, appears to have violated the provisions of section 12A (d), (e) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulation 3(ii) and regulation 4 of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  Calculation of wrongful gains:  (25) Since Noticees No. 2 to 5 have traded in the shares of NDTV while in possession of UPSI of the Company, the wrongful gains made by them have been calculated for the purpose of disgorgement as follows:  Table No. 5: Trading details of Net Buyers, i.e., Noticees No. 2, 3 and 4  Name UPSI period pertaining to  Net Buy Quantity Average Buy Price (\\\\\\\\u20b9) based on actuals Closing Price on the day announcement of PSI at NSE (\\\\\\\\u20b9) * Wrongful gain (\\\\\\\\u20b9) # A B C D = A x (C-B) Prenita Dutt PSI-6 25000 404.71 411.10       1,59,750.00  Prenita Dutt Total 25000 - - 1,59,750.00  QSPL PSI-6 1000 408.00 411.10          3,100.00  QSPL Total 1000 - -          3,100.00 SREPL PSI-1 261569 191.71 220.50    75,30,571.51  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 5 Entities                                      Page 9 of 72  Name UPSI period pertaining to  Net Buy Quantity Average Buy Price (\\\\\\\\u20b9) based on actuals Closing Price on the day announcement of PSI at NSE (\\\\\\\\u20b9) * Wrongful gain (\\\\\\\\u20b9) # A B C D = A x (C-B) PSI-2 350000 231.09 230.35      (2,59,000.00) PSI-3 240000 238.64 287.75  1,17,86,400.00  PSI-4 10000 304.99 396.90       9,19,100.00  PSI-6 48546 379.11 411.10    15,52,986.54  SREPL Total 910115 - - 2,15,30,058.05 Grand Total 931115 232.72   2,16,92,908.05  # Note: Wrongful gain has been calculated as per the following method:  Wrongful gain = (Closing price on the day of announcement * - Average buy price) X Net buy quantity during UPSI period  * If the announcement was made during the trading day before closing of trading hours, the closing price of the same day is considered. If the announcement was made post trading hours, the closing price of the next trading day is considered.

I note that based on the aforesaid findings from the investigation, SEBI issued a common SCN to the above named 5 Noticees on August 31, 2018, inter alia, levelling the following allegations against the 5 Noticees:  As regards Noticee No. 1 -   (1) Noticee No. 1, by virtue of his engagement with NDTV in terms of the Consultancy Agreements, held a position involving a professional and business relationship between himself and NDTV having complete responsibility and accountability for the Corporate Finance and Strategic Planning function and as such was reasonably expected to have access to the unpublished price sensitive information in relation to NDTV.  (2) Noticee No. 1 is a \\\\\\\\u201cconnected person\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of regulation 2(c)(ii) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  (3) Noticee No. 1 had direct access to and was in possession of unpublished price sensitive information of NDTV during his tenure of association with NDTV. (4) Noticee No. 1 is an \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of regulation 2(e)(i) and 2(e)(ii) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  As regards Noticee No. 2 -  (5) Noticee No. 2, being the wife of Noticee No. 1, is deemed to be a connected person in terms of regulation 2(h)(viii) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  (6) Further, Noticee No. 2 being wife of Noticee No. 1 is reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information.  (7) Noticee No. 2 is also an \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of regulation 2(e)(i) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 read with regulation 2(h)(viii) of the Regulations.  As regards Noticee No. 3 \\\\\\\\u2013  (8) Noticee No. 3 is deemed to be a connected person in terms of regulation 2(h)(ix) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  (9) Noticee No. 3 is reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information since Noticee No. 1 is promoter and director of Noticee No. 3.  (10) Noticee No. 3 is an \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of regulation 2(e)(i) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 read with regulation 2(h)(ix) of the Regulations.  As regards Noticee No. 4 \\\\\\\\u2013  (11) Noticee No. 4 is deemed to be a connected person in terms of regulation 2(h)(ix) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 5 Entities                                      Page 11 of 72  (12) Noticee No. 4 is reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information since Noticee No. 2 is a promoter and director of Noticee No. 4.  (13) Noticee No. 4 is an \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of regulation 2(e)(i) read with regulation 2(h)(ix) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.   As regards Noticee No. 5 \\\\\\\\u2013  (14) Noticee No. 5 is deemed to be a connected person in terms of regulation 2(h)(ix) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  (15) Noticee No. 5 is reasonably expected to have access to unpublished price sensitive information since Noticee No. 1 is promoter and director of Noticee No. 5.  (16) Noticee No. 5 is an \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of regulation 2(e)(i) read with regulation 2(h)(ix) of the PIT Regulations, 1992.   (17) All the Noticees fall squarely under the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cconnected person\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d with respect to NDTV in terms of regulation 2(c) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 and regulation 2(e) of the PIT Regulations, 1992, respectively.  (18) All the above-stated six (6) disclosures by NDTV to the Stock Exchanges during the Investigation Period are deemed to be price sensitive information in terms of regulation 2(ha) of the PIT Regulations, 1992 and if any one of such PSI was published, it would have materially affected the price of securities of NDTV.  (19) Though some of these Noticees were trading in NDTV shares even prior to Noticee No. 1\\\\\\\\u2019s association with NDTV, i.e., prior to July 2006, their buy quantity in NDTV has substantially increased during the period when Noticee No. 1 remained closely associated with NDTV, i.e., from July 2006 to June 2008.   (20) Some of these Noticees have sold substantial quantities of shares starting from June 2008.  (21) Noticees No. 2 to 5, by dealing in securities of NDTV (a company listed on NSE and BSE) when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, have violated the provisions of section 12A (d), (e) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulation 3(i) and regulation 4 of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  (22) Noticee No. 1, by directly or indirectly communicating unpublished price sensitive information to Noticees No. 2 to 5, has violated the provisions of section 12A (d), (e) of the SEBI Act read with regulation 3(ii) and regulation 4 of the PIT Regulations, 1992.  4. Accordingly, the Noticees were advised to show cause as to why suitable directions under section 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 including direction for disgorgement of illegal gains be not issued against them for the aforementioned alleged violations of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the PIT  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 5 Entities                                      Page 12 of 72  Regulations, 1992. The Noticees were also advised to submit their replies, if any, within 21 days of the receipt of the SCN failing which it would be construed that the Noticees have no reply to submit and SEBI would be free to take action against them on the basis of materials available on record in terms of the SEBI Act, 1992 and other laws as applicable.  5. It is worth mentioning here that although the PIT Regulations, 1992 have been repealed by the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015, regulation 12 of the new Regulations, 2015, provides as under:   \\\\\\\\u201cRepeal and Savings. 12.(1) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 are hereby repealed.   (2) Notwithstanding such repeal, \\\\\\\\u2014   (a) the previous operation of the repealed regulations or anything duly done or suffered thereunder, any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the repealed regulations, any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against the repealed regulations, or any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid, shall remain unaffected as if the repealed regulations had never been repealed;   (b) anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken including any adjudication, enquiry or investigation commenced or show-cause notice issued under the repealed regulations prior to such repeal, shall be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of these regulations;   (3) After the repeal of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992, any reference thereto in any other regulations made, guidelines or circulars issued thereunder by the Board shall be deemed to be a reference to the corresponding provisions of these regulations.\\\\\\\\u201d  6. Thus, any proceedings initiated for any alleged contraventions under the PIT Regulations, 1992 are saved and can be proceeded with under the said repealed PIT Regulations, 1992. Considering the foregoing, the instant proceedings against the Noticees can be continued as such.    7. I note that all the Noticees have filed their separate written replies in the matter, the details of which are as under:  Sl. No.  Noticee  Date of reply 1.

In compliance with the principles of natural justice, these Noticees were granted opportunity of personal hearing on September 18, 2019 when the counsel from M/s Finsec Law advisors appeared as the common authorized representative (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cAR\\\\\\\\u201d) on behalf of the Noticees and made oral submissions on the lines of the written replies already filed by the respective Noticees in the matter. During the course of personal hearing, Noticees No. 3 to 5 were asked to provide the copies of their audited balance sheets and profit and loss accounts for the relevant years. The said Noticees were also asked to submit details of their trades in the scrip of NDTV during the relevant years.   9. Subsequently, vide letter dated October 1, 2019, the AR of the Noticees submitted some of the documents. The Noticees also contended that the investigation period being more than 10 years old, they were unable to retrieve the data for the financial year 2007-08 and the same would be submitted as soon as the same is located. Vide the said letter, the Noticees submitted the following documents:  (a) The income tax statements and audited balance sheets of the concerned Noticees for the financial years 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09 in support of their arguments that the said Noticees had their respective independent source of income; trading in various securities including in the scrip of NDTV, being one such source.  (b) The transaction statements of the said Noticees for the financial years 2006-07 and 2008-09 to prove that NDTV was not the only scrip in which the said Noticees had traded during the relevant period. The Noticees claim that the transaction statements also clarify the actual price at which trading was done, the amount of losses that the said Noticees had incurred and the frequency at which trading in the scrip of NDTV had taken place during the relevant investigation period.  10. With regards to Noticee No. 3 (QSPL), the AR for Noticees submitted that there was no trading by the said Noticee during the relevant investigation period. It is also contended that one of the clients of the portfolio management division of the said Noticee had purchased 1000 shares of NDTV, besides other scrips (details of which were provided in annexure). Hence, with respect to Noticee No. 3, the allegations of trading while in possession of confidential information is incorrect. The Noticee also reiterated its submissions, as made during the previous personal hearing, stating that in the SCN, the amount of unlawful gains has been calculated at the closing price of NDTV shares during various PSI periods. However, the trading details provided by the Noticee clearly shows that during the relevant period, the Noticees had only purchased a small  Order in the matter of New Delhi Television Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 5 Entities                                      Page 14 of 72  number of shares of NDTV and did not sell any shares. Further upon looking into the actual purchase and sell transactions, the Noticee had made huge losses on their trading activities in the scrip of NDTV.   11. The Noticees, vide email dated October 31, 2020, were granted one more opportunity to make additional submissions, if any, within ten days of the receipt of the said email. The ARs of the Noticees vide their email dated November 17, 2020 have submitted a common compilation of submissions already made earlier by them.    12.

Ms. Dipti Darshanbhai Parmar  AUHPP1427H  In the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited (The aforesaid entities are hereinafter individually referred to by their respective names/Noticee nos. and collectively as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d, unless the context specifies otherwise)  BACKGROUND  1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) conducted an investigation into the trading activities in the scrip of Atlanta Infrastructure and FinanceOrder in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 2 of 24 Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAIFL / Company\\\\\\\\u201d), for the period from August 2, 2010 to January 6, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d). The Investigation Period was divided into several patches based on the price movement witnessed in the scrip of the Company, however, for the purpose of the instant proceedings, the relevant patches during which the allegations of violations were noticed were Patch-2 and Patch- 6 of the Investigation Period. It was observed that the shares of the Company witnessed a price fall from \\\\\\\\u20b948.00 to \\\\\\\\u20b916.60 during the period from February 26, 2013 to July 9, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPatch\\\\\\\\u20132\\\\\\\\u201d) and price rise from \\\\\\\\u20b94.30 to \\\\\\\\u20b914.57 during the period from September 3, 2014 to December 22, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPatch-6\\\\\\\\u201d). 2. The investigation conducted by SEBI initially identified a group of 29 connected entities (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cGroup entities\\\\\\\\u201d), who had traded in AIFL scrip and their inter se connection was noticed on the basis of their UCC details, off market transactions, physical share transfers, financial transactions and MCA data etc. It was further observed that out of the said 29 entities, the alleged manipulative trades in AIFL scrip were executed by 8 entities viz:- Mr. Manish Manubhai Raja, M/s. Pari Stock Trading Private Limited, Mr. Pavan Anilbhai Gandhi, Ms. Pritiben Anil Gandhi, Mr. Dharmesh Narendrakumar Solanki, Mr. Girishkumar Prabhudas Ruparel, Mr. Amrutlal Jivandas Gandhi and Ms. Dipti Darshanbhai Parmar (Noticees no. 1 to 8), which did not appear to be genuine trades executed in normal course of dealing in securities and therefore, those 8 entities were alleged to have engaged in manipulating the price of the scrip of AIFL and thereby creating a misleading appearance of trading in the shares of the Company, through their trading in the scrip during Patch-2 and Patch-6 of the Investigation Period. SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, HEARING AND REPLIES 3. Based on the aforesaid findings during the Investigation, a common Show Cause Notice dated February 14, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to Noticees asking them to show cause as to why necessary directions under Sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11(B) of the SEBI Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) shall not be issuedOrder in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 3 of 24 against them for violation of provisions of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations, 2003\\\\\\\\u201d). I note that the SCN sent through Speed Post was duly delivered on all of the Noticees except Noticees no. 4, 6 and 7 as the SCN\\\\\\\\u2019s were returned with reason undelivered. Subsequently, service delivery of SCN was attempted through Affixture on the last known address of Noticees no. 4, 6 and 7. The details of the service of SCN through affixture is tabulated below: Noticee no. Affixture Date Affixture Address 4 26/10/2018 C-702, Sadguru Vatika, Airport, Road, Rajkot, Gujarat-360001 6 25/10/2018 A/6, Nasib Apartment, Behind Police Quarters, Heera Baug, Ambavadi, Ahmedabad, Gujarat-380006 7 29/10/2018 Anil-10 Station Plot, Gondal, Gujarat, 360311  4. From the records, I note that Noticee no. 8 has submitted a written reply dated April 27, 2018 in response to the SCN raising therein the following points: a) That she is not part of the alleged 29 connected Group entities and she is also not connected to Noticee no. 3 (Mr. Pavan Gandhi) as has been alleged in the SCN and has enclosed copy of her KYC document to substantiate that she has not mentioned/ disclosed the address \\\\\\\\u201c10 Station Plot Gondal Dist Rajkot\\\\\\\\u201d as her address in the KYC documents executed by her. b) That she has not engaged in manipulation of the price of the scrip of AIFL. Considering the fact that only one trade executed by her resulting in contribution of \\\\\\\\u20b91.10 of negative LTP in the shares of the Company has been attributed to her, for which she has been wrongly charged with violation of provisions of PFUTP Regulations, 2003 in the SCN.Order in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 4 of 24 5. All the Noticees were provided with an opportunity of personal hearing on May 7, 2019. The husband of Noticee no. 8 attended the hearing on May 7, 2019 on her behalf and stated that he had executed the trades on behalf of his wife (Noticee no. 8) in the scrip of AIFL and that such trades were executed based on the tips received by him through \\\\\\\\u2018sms\\\\\\\\u2019 and that the trades were not done with any intention of manipulating the market. He also denied any connection of Noticee no. 8 with other Noticees, particularly with Noticee no. 3, as alleged in the SCN. 6. I note from the records that a letter dated May 2, 2019 has been addressed by the daughter of Noticee no. 4, informing that Noticee no. 4 has expired on May 16, 2018 in support of which, she has enclosed a death certificate. Noticee no. 1 vide letter dated May 6, 2019 had requested for another date of hearing. The Authorized Representative of Noticee no. 5 vide letter dated April 24, 2019 has submitted that Noticee no. 5 did not receive the SCN, hence has requested for a copy of SCN along with necessary annexures with a further request for adjournment of the hearing. Accordingly, a copy of SCN with Annexures were dispatched to the Noticee no. 5 on June 10, 2019. However, no reply from him has been received till date. I also note that Noticee no. 2 has submitted written replies, vide letters dated July 1, 2019 and July 15, 2019. Also, Noticees no. 3 and 7 have submitted their written replies, vide letters dated June 24, 2019 and July 9, 2019 respectively, inter-alia, requesting for another opportunity of personal hearing. 7. Keeping in view the aforesaid requests from the Noticees, in the interest of natural justice, another opportunity of personal hearing was provided to all the remaining Noticees no. (1 to 7) on August 7, 2019. I note that the hearing notices were duly served upon all the Noticees. For instance, hearing notice was served upon Noticee no. 1 through emails dated July 15, 2019 and August 06, 2019 on email id (manishmorbi@yahoo.com) provided by the Noticee no. 1. Similarly, for Noticee no. 6, as the SCN returned undelivered through Speed Post, the hearing notice was served through paper publication and same was published in Newspaper Sandesh- Ahmedabad Edition dated July 31, 2019. On the said hearing date, aOrder in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 5 of 24 common Authorized Representatives for Noticees no. 2, 3 and 7 attended the personal hearing on their behalf and after making his oral presentations, requested some more time to give written response to some of the queries raised before me during the hearing. The Authorized Representative has submitted that Noticees no. 3 and 7 are not related to Noticee no. 2 and that they are also not related to the promoters of the Company (AIFL). Subsequently, Noticees no. 3 and 7 vide letters dated August 8, 2019 and August 28, 2019 respectively, have enclosed their trading details for the years 2009-2016 to substantiate their pleadings that they were regular traders in the market. I find that Noticee no. 1, 5 and 6 have neither filed any replies to the SCN nor have responded to the notice of Personal hearing despite repeated opportunities having been offered to them. After perusing the written and oral submissions of Noticees no. 2, 3 and 7, I find that they have made several common contentions and pleadings, which need to be highlighted as under: a) That Adjudication Proceedings have also been initiated against them for the same set of violation as alleged in the present proceedings. b) That delay in issuing SCN in 2018 has caused prejudice to them as they do not recollect the reasons for investment and sale of shares thereof. The SCN is erroneous and does not explain as to how conducting the present proceedings will help in protection of the interest of investors and the integrity of the Securities Market. c) That power to issue directions under Section 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 is not available for retrospective application and even the nature of proposed direction is not specified in the SCN. The SCN must set out the circumstances requiring such drastic use of power belatedly as no prima facie case has been made to warrant issue of such directions of serious consequences. d) That Noticee no. 2 (Pari Stock Trading Pvt. Ltd.) has been amalgamated with Kharisara Palace Pvt. Ltd. They had acquired 1,40,000 shares of the Company in the year 2009 and were further allotted 5,00,000 shares by way of preferential allotment in 2010 and remained invested in AIFL for about 3 years and sold the shares in 2013. Noticee no. 2 hasOrder in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 6 of 24 denied being part of any group as alleged in the SCN and also has denied having any connection with the counterparty seller (Noticee no. 5). It has been submitted that the SCN has attributed a miniscule contribution of negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b90.40 through its 6 trades, out of the total market negative LTP observed in the scrip. e) That the Noticee no. 3 was allotted 3,50,000 shares of the Company in preferential allotment in 2010 and after remaining invested for more than 2 years, he sold these shares in 2013. He further bought shares of the Company AIFL in 2014 and is still holding 2,18,975 shares of the Company. His trading\\\\\\\\u2019s contribution to total market negative LTP of the scrip was a miniscule 0.47%. f) Noticee no. 3 has denied having any connection with Noticee no. 8 (as alleged in the SCN) as the address \\\\\\\\u201810 Station Plot\\\\\\\\u2019 is a big area of commercial and residential units and their family house at \\\\\\\\u2018Anil, 10 Station Plot, Gujarat\\\\\\\\u2019 is 50 years old hence, connecting him with Noticee no. 8 based on the address \\\\\\\\u201810 Station Plot\\\\\\\\u2019 is erroneous. g) That Noticee no. 7 bought shares of the Company during 2010-2013, took deliveries, remained invested and sold shares in 2014 on 100% delivery basis. He is still holding 7,52,500 shares of the Company. He has been trading for several decades and is still holding shares of different companies. The contribution to total market negative LTP of the scrip by his trading in the scrip was a miniscule 1.03%. Noticee no. 7 has denied having any connection with the counterparty buyer to his trades (Noticee no. 1) and has submitted that he does not know Noticee no. 5 as the mobile number shown to be the basis for connection between them does not actually belong to him. Further on the whole, he has suffered losses in the investments made by him in the scrip of the Company. h) That they were not part of any Group as alleged in the SCN. However, Noticee no. 3 has acknowledged that he is the grandson of Noticee no. 7 and Noticee no. 4 was his mother, yet stressed that their trading was independent of such connection and his trades ought to be analyzed in isolation.Order in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 7 of 24 CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINIDNGS: 8. Based on the afore-stated allegations in the SCN, I find the only issue that requires consideration in the matter is: Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the Noticees have violated provisions of Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d), 4 (1) and 4 (2) (a), (e) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. 9. Before proceeding to examine the aforesaid question on merit, it would be proper to refer to the relevant provisions of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003 which have been allegedly violated by the Noticees, and the same are quoted below as under: -   PFUTP Regulations, 2003  3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities  No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014  a) use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under;  (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange;  (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.  4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices  (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities.Order in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 8 of 24 (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following, namely: - (a) indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market;  \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. (e) any act or omission amounting to manipulation of the price of a security; \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. 10. The investigation conducted by SEBI revealed that the first trade in the scrip of AIFL during Patch-2 was executed at \\\\\\\\u20b948.00 and last trade was executed at \\\\\\\\u20b916.60, thereby registering a fall of \\\\\\\\u20b931.40 in the scrip price. It was observed that a total no. of 62 trades executed in the scrip amongst Noticees no. 1 to 8 during Patch-2 had caused a negative variation of \\\\\\\\u20b925.35 to the last traded price (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cLTP\\\\\\\\u201d) which constituted 21.72% of total market negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b9116.70/- observed in the scrip during Patch-2 of the Investigation Period. The details of such 62 trades are tabulated below: Table-1 Buyer Name Seller Name Manish Manubhai Raja Pari Stock Trading Private Limited Pavan Anilbhai Gandhi Total No. of trades LTP impact % of total market negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b9116.70 No. of trades LTP impact % of total market negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b9116.70 No. of trades LTP impact % of total market negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b9116.70 No. of trades LTP impact % of total market negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b9116.70 Pritiben Anil Gandhi 47 -20.40 -17.48% -  -  0.00% -  -  0.00% 47 -20.40 17.48% Dharmesh Narendrakumar Solanki 1 -0.35 -0.30% 6 -0.40 -0.34% -  -  0.00% 7 -0.75 0.64% Girishkumar Prabhudas Ruparel 3 -1.35 -1.16% -  -  0.00% -  -  0.00% 3 -1.35 1.16% Manish Manubhai Raja -  -  0.00% -  -  0.00% 2 -0.55 -0.47% 2 -0.55 0.47%Order in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 9 of 24 Buyer Name Seller Name Manish Manubhai Raja Pari Stock Trading Private Limited Pavan Anilbhai Gandhi Total No. of trades LTP impact % of total market negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b9116.70 No. of trades LTP impact % of total market negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b9116.70 No. of trades LTP impact % of total market negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b9116.70 No. of trades LTP impact % of total market negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b9116.70 Amrutlal Jivandas Gandhi 2 -1.20 -1.03% -  -  0.00% -  -  0.00% 2 -1.20 1.03% Dipti Darshanbhai Parmar 1 -1.10 -0.94% -  -  0.00% -  -  0.00% 1 -1.10 0.94% Grand Total 54 -24.40 20.91% 6 -0.40 0.34% 2 -0.55 0.47% 62 -25.35 21.72% 11. On a perusal of the table-1 above, I note that these entities (Noticees no. 1 to 3) had sold shares while the other five entities (Noticees no. 4 to 8) have acted as buyer, whereas Noticee no. 1 (Mr. Manish Manubhai Raja) has executed trades both as a buyer as well as seller. SCN proceeds on the allegations that these Noticees through the 62 trades, as noted above, have together contributed to a market negative LTP, which was 21.72% of the total market negative LTP seen during Patch-2 of the Investigation Period. Analysis of these 62 trades revealed that on most of the occasions, the buyer-Noticees were placing buy orders at a price lower than the previously traded price while the seller-Noticees were placing sell orders at the prevailing buy order price or lesser than the prevailing buy order price and as a result, the pending buy orders got matched and executed. 12. It is noted from table-1 above that out of the 62 trades referred to above, in 47 trades, shares were bought by Noticee no. 4 (Ms. Pritiben Anil Gandhi) during Patch-2 which contributed to a substantial 17.48% of total market negative LTP and the counter party seller for all of her 47 trades was none other than Noticee no. 1 (Mr. Manish Manubhai Raja). Thus while the trades executed by these 8 Noticees cumulatively have accounted for 21.72 % of total market negative LTP of the scrip, the 47 trades executed between Noticee no. 1 and 4 together were the major contributors (17.48%) to total market negative LTP of the scripOrder in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 10 of 24 during Patch-2 of the Investigation Period and have accounted for 80% of the total alleged negative LTP in the SCN. Further, on a perusal of the trade log pertaining to the details of the aforesaid alleged manipulative trades executed by the Noticees no. 1 and 4, it is observed that these two Noticees have substantially contributed to the fall in the price in the scrip of the Company from the period of April 8, 2013 to June 14, 2013. For better understanding of their trades some of the trades executed by these two Noticees are analyzed further in the table below: Table-2  TRADE_DATE CLIENTNAME CP_CLIENTNAME TRADEID TRADE_TIME ORDER_LMTIME CP_ORDER_LMTIME TRADE_RATE LTP_RATE ORDER_LMRATE CP_ORDER_LMRATE ORDER_LMQTY CP_ORDER_LMQTY 08/04/2013 PRITI ANILBHAI GANDHI MANISH MANUBHAI RAJA 1001 11:40:32 11:28:44 11:40:32 23.65 -0.3 23.65 23.5 2280 5000 08/04/2013 PRITI ANILBHAI GANDHI MANISH MANUBHAI RAJA 1002 11:40:32 11:26:38 11:40:32 23.6 -0.05 23.6 23.5 5000 5000 08/04/2013 PRITI ANILBHAI GANDHI MANISH MANUBHAI RAJA 1007 11:41:22 11:26:38 11:41:22 23.6 -0.05 23.6 23.5 5000 500 10/04/2013 PRITI ANILBHAI GANDHI MANISH MANUBHAI RAJA 1001 09:53:13 09:45:49 09:53:13 24 -0.15 24 23.7 500 500 10/04/2013 PRITI ANILBHAI GANDHI MANISH MANUBHAI RAJA 1002 09:53:15 09:27:58 09:53:15 23.95 -0.05 23.95 23.7 100 100 11/04/2013 PRITI ANILBHAI GANDHI MANISH MANUBHAI RAJA 1001 09:41:58 09:32:45 09:41:58 24.55 -0.05 24.55 24.55 500 200 15/04/2013 PRITI ANILBHAI GANDHI MANISH MANUBHAI RAJA 1008 09:56:04 09:45:59 09:56:04 25.2 -0.8 25.2 25.2 50 50 15/04/2013 PRITI ANILBHAI GANDHI MANISH MANUBHAI RAJA 1011 11:34:22 11:18:42 11:34:22 25.15 -0.8 25.15 25 10 25 15/04/2013 PRITI ANILBHAI GANDHI MANISH MANUBHAI RAJA 1012 11:34:22 11:18:45 11:34:22 25.1 -0.05 25.1 25 25 25Order in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 11 of 24 17/04/2013 PRITI ANILBHAI GANDHI MANISH MANUBHAI RAJA 1001 09:31:06 09:29:51 09:31:06 24.55 -0.2 24.55 24.55 200 100 18/04/2013 PRITI ANILBHAI GANDHI MANISH MANUBHAI RAJA 1001 09:19:15 09:17:02 09:19:15 24.15 -0.4 24.15 24.1 100 150 18/04/2013 PRITI ANILBHAI GANDHI MANISH MANUBHAI RAJA 1002 09:19:15 09:16:36 09:19:15 24.1 -0.05 24.1 24.1 200 150  13. It can be seen from the table-2 above that Noticee no. 1 and Noticee no. 4 have consecutively executed their trades and have thereby contributed to negative LTP of the scrip of AIFL. There is no reasonable explanation available on record to suggest as to why these two Noticees have engaged in executing such manipulative trades. For example- on April 8, 2013, Noticee no. 4 had placed a buy order in the scrip of AIFL at 11:28:44 for \\\\\\\\u20b923.65 and Noticee no. 1 has matched the said buy order by placing a sell order at 11:40:32 for \\\\\\\\u20b923.5 and the resultant trade was executed at 11:40:32 for \\\\\\\\u20b923.65 contributing to a negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b90.3. Similarly, in another trade executed on April 15, 2013, a buy order was placed by Noticee no. 4 at 09:45:59 for \\\\\\\\u20b925.2 which was followed by a sell order placed by Noticee no. 1 at 09:56:04 for \\\\\\\\u20b925.2 resulting in execution of trade at 09:56:04 at \\\\\\\\u20b925.2. Further, on April 18, 2013, a buy order was placed by Noticee no. 4 at 09:17:02 and Noticee no. 1 matched the said buy order within a few minutes at 09:19:15 resulting in execution of the trade between them at 09:19:15 which contributed to a negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b90.4. These were not just few isolated or solitary instances of trades between them as these two Noticees have engaged in executing as many as 47 such trades posing as buyer and seller respectively. By trading in this manner, both of them have matched each of their orders within a gap of few minutes thereby contributing to the fall in the price of the scrip of the Company. I note that Noticee no. 1 has not submitted any reply on merits in his defense while Noticee no. 4 is now deceased. Considering the fact that the Company did not have very strong fundamentals or financial performance during the relevant period, there is no explanation available on record to justify the manner on which,Order in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 12 of 24 the aforesaid trades in the scrip of the Company were executed by Noticees no. 1 and 4 over a considerable period of time. The pattern of trading exhibited by the two Noticees and the number of trades relentlessly executed by them for contributing to negative LTP cannot be accepted as genuine trades. The trading pattern followed by the Noticees no. 1 and 4 shows that they did not have any bona-fide intention to trade in the scrip as the series of such trades executed by them with each other, which triggered a steady fall in the price of the AIFL scrip can\\\\\\\\u2019t be held as trades executed with any bonafide motive or as genuine trades executed by ordinary investors in due course of dealings in the Securities Market. Under the circumstances, from the trading pattern and frequency of matching of trades between the Noticees no. 1 and 4, it is visible that their trades were executed with an intention to decrease the scrip price by deliberately placing orders at a lower price than the last traded price (LTP) and in the process also to create a misleading appearance of trading and volumes to entice other investors of securities market to trade in the scrip. I, therefore, hold that these two Noticees i.e. Noticees nos. 1 and 4 had engaged in price manipulation of the scrip of the Company by acting in concert and have contributed substantially to the total market negative LTP of the scrip and thereby have also created a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip by executing 47 such manipulative trades between themselves, during Patch-2 of the Investigation Period. 14.  Moving on to the other Noticees, I have examined the trades executed by them viz: Noticee no. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 during the Patch-2 of the Investigation Period, as highlighted in table-1 above and find that their individual contribution to market negative LTP as alleged in the SCN ranges from 0.34% to 1.16%. It is also noted that the number of trades executed by the above noted Noticees ranged from 1 to 7 trades per person while the trades executed commutatively by them together accounted for only 4.24% out of the 21.72% market negative LTP contributed by all the 8 Noticees together. It shows that the negative LTP contribution by the trades executed by these six Noticees individually, during Patch-2 wereOrder in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 13 of 24 very small and not substantial, when compared to the contribution made by Noticees no. 1 and 4 to the market negative LTP of the scrip as discussed in the preceding paragraph. 15. The inter se connections drawn between these Noticees as presented in a tabular chart in the annexure-1 enclosed to the SCN have also been perused from which I note that Noticees no. 3 is the grandson of Noticee no. 7 and Noticee no. 3 is the son of Noticee no. 4. While the Noticees no. 3 and 7 have acknowledged in their written replies their relationship with each other and their relationship with Noticee no. 4, they have also stressed on the fact that being adult and regular traders in the securities market, trading done by all of them were independent of each other as the same were executed out of their own wisdom and decision. It has also been submitted that the SCN also does not proceed to make any allegations in the nature that their trades were motivated and influenced by the decision of other Noticees. 16. They have further denied the charge of manipulation levelled against them in the SCN and have refuted any connection with the counterparty buyer/seller to their trades. They have contended that their miniscule trading or alleged small negative LTP contribution to the price of the AIFL scrip cannot be held as sufficient to cause any price manipulation in the scrip of the Company. These three Noticees have also denied that the mobile number that has been taken to be the basis for holding connection between Noticees no. 3, 4, 5 and 7, ever belonged to them. I note that Noticee no. 8 has denied any connection with Noticee no. 3 during the hearing. It has also been submitted by Noticee no. 3 that the so called common address held to be the point of connection between them, i.e.\\\\\\\\u201910 Station Plot\\\\\\\\u2019 is a huge plot of land comprising several units and hundreds of houses that are located on this piece of plot, hence, it would not be reasonable to allege any link amongst them, one based on the said common location which is too large an area to be used as a proof to establish any connection amongst them. I have also perused the KYC documents enclosed by Noticee no. 8 with her written reply to substantiate that the address \\\\\\\\u201c10 Station Plot Gondal Dist. Rajkot\\\\\\\\u201d has not been mentioned by her in her KYC documents.Order in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 14 of 24 17. I note that Noticees no. 1, 5 and 6 have not submitted any reply on merits in the present proceedings. On the whole, as far as inter-se connections amongst the Noticees are concerned, I find that although some of the Noticees have denied having any connection with other Noticees, the prima facie evidence that is available in SCN, especially in the tabular presentation in annexure-1 to the SCN gives a reasonably fair picture about the possible inter-se connectedness existing amongst different Noticees, by virtue of their common address, email ids, off-market transfer, common phone numbers etc. It has been vehemently argued that assuming without admitting the existence of inter-se connectedness amongst the Noticees, the same cannot be held to be the sole factor to declare that the trades executed by all the Noticees were manipulative and responsible for creating artificial volume & trade in the scrip, more particularly when the alleged individual contribution to the \\\\\\\\u2013LTP by many Noticees were very minimal. It has further been submitted that the allegations deserve to be tested on a reasonably stronger evidence. It has been submitted that the allegations lack merit, more so when Noticee no. 7 was holding more than 7.00 lack shares, whereas others Noticees subscribed to the shares under the preferential allotment. Based on the above, the Noticee no. 2, 3, and 7 have contended that in the absence of any strong evidence of their nexus with counter parties to their trades to demonstrating that trades were executed after prior meeting of minds, mere incidence of matching of order with the same counter party on a few occasions would not be sufficient to establish the alleged trades as manipulative and fraudulent. The Noticees have further argued that as the allegations pertain to price fall, it requires a closer examination of attending circumstances pertaining to the number, frequency and exact nature of the trades executed by the Noticees and stronger proof, in order to attribute the motive to them and to hold such trades to be manipulative or artificial trades executed only for pulling down the price of the scrip. 18. As noted from the details of the trades executed by the Noticees, which have been presented in the table no. 1 above, the Noticees no. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, & 8 have executed very few trades and their respective individual contributions to price fall of the stock of AIFL wasOrder in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited Page 15 of 24 miniscule. From the materials available on record, it is observed that Noticee no. 3, 6, 7, & 8 have executed only 2, 3, 2 and 1 trades respectively whereas Noticee no. 2 & 5 have executed 6 and 7 trades respectively during the Patch-2 of the Investigation Period. While Noticee no. 2, through its 6 trades is alleged to have caused a price fall of only \\\\\\\\u20b90.40, Noticee no. 3 has been alleged to have brought down the price of the scrip by \\\\\\\\u20b90.55 only. Similarly, Noticee no 5, 6, 7, & 8 had executed trades in variation of only \\\\\\\\u20b90.75, \\\\\\\\u20b91.35, \\\\\\\\u20b91.20 and \\\\\\\\u20b91.10 respectively, resulting in a very negligible amount of negative LTP in the scrip. I note that initially 29 entities were identified to be as suspected entities, however, based on the outcome of the investigation, trades of only 8 Noticees were suspected to be not genuine trades executed in the scrip of AIFL and therefore, the instant proceedings were initiated against the aforementioned 8 Noticees. 19. As discussed above, the afore-stated Noticees have vehemently disputed and denied having any trading connection with each other and Noticee no. 8 has also furnished her KYC document to support here dispute to the alleged connection with other Noticees as attributed to her in the SCN. Having considered the materials on record, the submissions made by the Noticees and the frequency and volume of trades executed by them that are alleged to have caused price fall in the scrip, I find that notwithstanding their inter se relation as alleged in the SCN, the trades executed by these Noticees are very few in number and very small in volume. Therefore, the contribution to negative LTP of the scrip resulting from their trades was too meagre and not material enough to be held as having created any artificial or misleading trade volume so as to have negative impact on the price of the scrip. Moreover, the fact that the Noticees are still holding substantial quantities of shares of the Company, in my view, the trades executed by the Noticees no. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 do not contain sufficient evidence to be held as manipulative or fraudulent so as to create a misleading appearance in trading in the scrip of the Company or to mis", "Date": "2020-11-27", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Order in the matter of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/nov-2020/order-in-the-matter-of-atlanta-infrastructure-and-finance-limited_48311.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 57341, "unique_record_id": "ec8eca3bcaSEBI20201127", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "668059407858910306471264", "parse_date": "2024-06-29 18:57:37", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "No financial penalties are mentioned in the article.", "gpt_audience": "- Regulatory authorities\n- Legal professionals\n- Investors in Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited\n- Financial analysts\n- Compliance officers\n- Company management of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited\n- Shareholders of Atlanta Infrastructure and Finance Limited\n- Market researchers\n- Financial journalists\n- Auditors", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

It was observed that Bharat Patel Group including Noticees 1 , 2 and 3 repetitively executed synchronised trades for 5,48,959 shares (22.04% of the market volume) in 34 trades over 28 trading days at BSE and thus created misleading appearance of trading in the scrip without any intention of change in ownership of the security.  20. It was also seen that Bharat Patel Group including Noticees 1 , 2 and 3 executed synchronized trades for 1,24,587 shares (5.70% of the market volume) over 16 trades on 11 trading days at NSE during the investigation period.   21. In view of the above, it was alleged that Noticees 1, 2 and 3 had violated the provisions of Section 12A (a), (b) and (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3   Adjudication Order in respect of Innovative Data Organisers Pvt. Ltd., BJD Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Medium Investments Co. Pvt. Ltd.in the matter of Super Sales Ltd.  Page 11 of 16  (a), (b), (c) and (d), and Regulation 4(1) and 4(2)(a) and (g) of the PFUTP Regulations.   22. The Noticees 1, 2 and 3 replied to the SCN vide letters dated November 7, 2020, stating the following:- a. The Noticees have not created artificial appearance of trading by entering into synchronised trades in the scrip of SSIL b. The Noticees took delivery of all shares purchased and gave delivery of all shares sold and there has been change in beneficial ownership.  c. The Noticees are being asked to show cause about a six year old transaction which could have been carried out for various reasons including tax planning, liquidity requirement or better investment opportunities.  d. Trading was done on-market and on the screen it was not possible to know that shares sold by Noticees were the same shares bought by the other persons and vice versa. All transactions were as per trading norms and not performed with an intent to carry on synchronised trades. e. SCN has not quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage or loss to investors due to the impugned synchronised trades of the Noticees.   23. The Noticees were granted an opportunity of hearing by video conferencing through WebEx on November 11, 2020 vide hearing Notices dated October 21, 2020. However, upon the request of the Noticees, the said hearing was rescheduled to November 24, 2020.   24. During the personal hearing granted to the Noticees through video conferencing by WebEx on November 24, 2020, the Authorised Representatives of the Noticees \\\\\\\\u2013 Mr. Jay Dattani reiterated the submissions made vide the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 replies dated November 7, 2020. It was also submitted that all the above three companies have   Adjudication Order in respect of Innovative Data Organisers Pvt. Ltd., BJD Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Medium Investments Co. Pvt. Ltd.in the matter of Super Sales Ltd.  Page 12 of 16  been investing in equities of many listed companies for more than 20 years mostly holding them for long term and that is the primary business of these companies. It was stated that these three companies combined are presently holding shares in approximately 130 listed companies and with average holding period of more than two years, and that the Noticees have never indulged in intraday trading. The Noticees also submitted that they had no connection with the Bharat Patel group of entities.  25. In the light of the allegations contained in the SCN, the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 submissions in respect of the allegations made in the SCN and relevant material available on record, I hereby proceed to decide the case on merits.    CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 26. The issues arising for consideration in the instant proceedings before me are:-  I. Whether the provisions of Section 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, and  Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) & (d), 4 (1) and 4(2) (a) & (g) of the PFUTP Regulations by the Noticees II. If yes, whether the Noticees are liable for imposition of monetary penalty under Sections 15HA of the SEBI Act? III. If yes, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticee taking into consideration the factors stipulated in Section 15 J of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 (2) of the Adjudication Rules?     I. Whether the provisions of Section 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, and  Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) & (d), 4 (1) and 4(2) (a) & (g) of the PFUTP Regulations by the Noticees  27. In the present case, the allegations levelled against the Noticees arise from the fact that between December 15, 2011 to October 09, 2014, the price and volume   Adjudication Order in respect of Innovative Data Organisers Pvt. Ltd., BJD Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Medium Investments Co. Pvt. Ltd.in the matter of Super Sales Ltd.  Page 13 of 16  fluctuations in the scrip of Super Sales India Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cSSIL\\\\\\\\u201d) or \\\\\\\\u201cthe Company\\\\\\\\u201d) were investigated by SEBI and it was revealed that certain entities, including Noticees 1, 2 and 3, had carried out repeated synchronised trades which created an artificial appearance of trading in the scrip without any intent of change in beneficial ownership of shares.  It is also alleged that the Noticees are connected to Bharat Jantilal Patel through fund transfers.  28. With regard to the connections, the Noticees are admittedly connected to each other. The Noticees have denied any connection to the Bharat Patel Group during the hearing. The alleged connection is on the basis of fund movement with Bharat Jayantilal Patel. However, the material on record has not brought out details of the fund movement. Even accepting that there is some fund movement, the reasons for such movement or how it links to the trading by the Noticees is not available on record.    29. Percentage of gross buy and sell by the Noticees during the investigation period as provided in the SCN is reproduced below for reference:-  Name of Entity BSE NSE Gross Buy % of Gross Buy to Mkt. Vol. Gross Sell % of Gross Sell to Mkt. Vol. Gross Buy % of Gross Buy to Mkt. Vol. Gross Sell % of Gross Sell to Mkt. Vol. Bjd Securities Pvt. Ltd 44,633 1.79 13,690 0.55 0 0.00 0 0.00 Medium Investments Co P Ltd 1,780 0.07 5,977 0.24 0 0.00 0 0.00 Innovative Data Orgn. Pvt Ltd 593 0.02 3,945 0.16 0 0.00 0 0.00  30. Thus, it is observed that as a percentage of market volumes in the scrip of SSIL, the gross volume of shares traded by the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 ranged from 0.02% by Noticee 1 to 1.79% by Noticee 2 on BSE. There are no trades by the Noticees on NSE.   Adjudication Order in respect of Innovative Data Organisers Pvt. Ltd., BJD Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Medium Investments Co. Pvt. Ltd.in the matter of Super Sales Ltd.  Page 14 of 16   31. Further, from the SCN it is noted that the allegations in respect of the Noticees pertain to a total of 5 synchronised trades on BSE as follows: Buyer Name Seller Name Sync. Qty. % of Sync. Vol. to Mkt. Vol. No. of Trades No of days Bjd Securities Pvt. Ltd Innovative Data Organisers Pvt Ltd 1,000 0.04 1 1 Bjd Securities Pvt. Ltd Hridaynath Consultancy Pvt. Ltd. 50 0.00 1 1 Bjd Securities Pvt. Ltd Medium Investments Co Pvt Ltd 3,495 0.14 3 2  32. In this context, the trade log for trades of the Noticees on BSE was examined. A perusal of the trade and order details revealed the following:- (a) Noticees 1 and 2 had three trades between them with Noticee 2 as the buyer, for total quantity of 2910 shares which were synchronised in terms of time. These were on widely differing dates \\\\\\\\u2013 3/1/12, 6/1/12 and 9/8/14. In 2 of the trades, quantity was not synchronised. Hence, SCN states only synchronised trade. (b)  Noticees 2 and 3 had 5 synchronised trades in terms of time between them with Noticees 2 as buyer for a traded quantity of 4593 shares. The synchronised trades entered into by Noticee 2 with Noticee 3 were carried out on 01/03/12, 07/03/12 and 18/08/14. Out of these, 1 trade was not synchronised in price or quantity. Hence, there were 4 synchronised trades between Noticees 2 and 3. (c) Further, 10 trades carried out by Noticee 2 with Hridaynath Consultancy Pvt. Ltd. (a Bharat Patel Group entity) on 30/04/14 for 296 shares were synchronised. 7 of these had different order quantities while 2 had different order prices. Hence, SCN states only one synchronised trade.   33. It is also seen from the trade log that Noticee 1 carried out 31 trades on the buy side out of which 4 were synchronised in terms of time. Noticee 2 had total 751 buy trades of which 360 were synchronised in terms of time. Noticee 3 had 23 buy trades of which 6 were synchronised in terms of time. The counterparties to their trades were diverse and unconnected to the Noticees/Bharat Patel group.   Adjudication Order in respect of Innovative Data Organisers Pvt. Ltd., BJD Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Medium Investments Co. Pvt. Ltd.in the matter of Super Sales Ltd.  Page 15 of 16  34. Given the fact that the Noticees entered into several trades of which only a few were found to be synchronised, the trading pattern cannot be said to reflect deliberate synchronisation at the time of order entry. Hence, it is not possible to conclude volume manipulation on the basis of the impugned 5 trades.  35. I must also accord due consideration to the submission of the Noticees that they are long-term investors in the scrip of SSIL in tandem with their primary business, and that they traded infrequently in the scrip for a very limited quantity of shares. This assertion has been borne out through the trade log as well.   36. In this regard, I refer to the observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Ketan Parekh. V. SEBI (decided on 14.07.2006) stating that \\\\\\\\u201ca synchronised trade or a trade that matches off market is per se not illegal. Merely because a trade was crossed on the floor of the stock exchange with the buyer and seller entering the price at which they intended to buy and sell respectively, the transaction does not become illegal.\\\\\\\\u201d   37. Therefore, the fact of synchronised trades between entities known to each other by itself does not constitute convincing evidence of a fraudulent or unfair trade practice in terms of Section 12 A of the SEBI Act or Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) as well as 4 (1) and 2(a) and (g) of the PFUTP Regulations. The test of preponderance of probabilities is not satisfied when evidence on record, such as the trading pattern of the Noticees and the volume of synchronised trades carried out amongst the Noticees and Hridaynath (0.18%), is considered in the context of all the trades carried out in the scrip during the investigation period.   38. As held by the Supreme Court in the matter of SEBI v. Kishore Ajmera (Civil Appeal No. 2818 of 2008), cited by the Noticees as well, \\\\\\\\u201cIt is a fundamental principle of law that proof of an allegation levelled against a person may be in the form of direct substantive evidence or, as in many cases, such proof may have to be inferred by a logical process of reasoning from the totality of the attending facts and circumstances surrounding the allegations/charges made and levelled.\\\\\\\\u201d Therefore,   Adjudication Order in respect of Innovative Data Organisers Pvt. Ltd., BJD Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Medium Investments Co. Pvt. Ltd.in the matter of Super Sales Ltd.  Page 16 of 16  all contextual evidence including trading pattern needs due consideration, and in the present matter, the material on record does not indicate that the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019 trades were motivated by intent to manipulate volumes in the scrip during the investigation period.    39. In view of the above, the charge pertaining to violation of Section 12A (a), (b) and (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 r/w Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d), 4 (1), 4 (2) (a) and (g) of PFUTP Regulations by the Noticees is not established.   40. Therefore, Issues II and III do not merit consideration.    ORDER  41.

Moses Road, Worli Naka, Mumbai - 400018.    1. For the purpose of examination (including forensic investigation by an external agency) with respect to colocation facility provided by the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"NSE\") including issues with respect to preferential access given to certain trading members (\\\\\\\\u2018TM\\\\\\\\u2019) for Tick-by-Tick (hereinafter referred to as \"TBT\") data feed, TMs connecting to secondary server even when the primary server is available etc.., SEBI advised NSE Board to undertake forensic audit in the cash, currency derivatives and Interest Rate Futures segments. Accordingly, NSE Board appointed Ernst & Young LLP (\\\\\\\\u2018E&Y\\\\\\\\u2019) to conduct forensic audit in the matter. E&Y submitted its Report dated May 18, 2018 covering the aforesaid segments. In the said report read with its e-mail dated June 27, 2018, E&Y submitted the following data analysis on secondary server access by Crosseas Capital Services Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cCrosseas\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticee\\\\\\\\u201d), a SEBI registered stock broker:  Table-1 - Data analysis by E&Y on secondary server access by Crosseas  Year 2012  2013  2014  2015  Total days  No of Days - - 66 40 106  2. The scope of the investigation was to examine the connivance / collusion of NSE's employees (past and current) with stock brokers (including their past and current employees) during the period 2009-16 and the role of stock brokers alleged to have been benefited from preferential access to the exchange's system, including quantification of gains of the stock brokers, to the extent possible, from such mechanism during the period 2009-16. The investigation inter-alia focused on the role of______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Crosseas Capital Services Private Limited Page 2 of 17  Crosseas which is a Trading Member (\\\\\\\\u2018TM\\\\\\\\u2019) of NSE, BSE and MSEI (erstwhile MCX-SX) in Cash, F&O and Currency Derivative segments.   3. In this regard, SEBI appointed Deloitte for conducting forensic audit of Crosseas. The Forensic Audit Report of Deloitte was submitted to SEBI on June 15, 2018. The investigation team noted the aforesaid findings in E&Y Report dated May 18, 2018 and the following findings in the Forensic Audit report of Deloitte dated June 15, 2018, with regard to Crosseas:  i) We noted an email dated May 20, 2014 from Krishna Dagli to Crosseas advising them to connect to the secondary server for better performance. On the same day, we noted an email from Crosseas to NSE COLO support requesting to connect to the secondary server. However, the response from NSE stated that the same can be done only if Crosseas is unable to connect to the primary server. ii) Further, on analysis of the limited TBT logs submitted by Crosseas for the period June 02, 2014 to December 26, 2014, it was noted during this period, Crosseas had frequently connected to the secondary server. The summary of the same is provided in the below table: Number of Days Connected to IP Secondary/Primary Server 76 172.28.124.17 Secondary 19 172.28.124.13 172.28.124.17 Both 4 172.28.124.11; 172.28.124.13 and 172.28.124.17 Both  Data breakup provided by Deloitte vide email dated June 25, 2018 iii) Further, Crosseas intermittently connected to the secondary server of the cash market segment for 219 days from October 03, 2011 to February 27, 2015 using multiple IP addresses. The total number of connects made by Crosseas in the cash market segment during aforementioned period was 656 connects\\\\\\\\u2026. iv) Rajesh Baheti stated that Crosseas had multiple servers connected to NSE, this was done to make sure that at no given time Crosseas was totally reliant on a single connection for data. Hence, Crosseas connected to both primary and secondary servers at NSE. On being asked about instances where only connectivity to the secondary server was observed, we were informed that Crosseas had connected directly to the secondary server on multiple occasions as there was no official communication from NSE asking Crosseas to disconnect from the secondary server. Rajesh Baheti also stated that Crosseas often took up performance issues to Krishna and it may have been Krishna's idea to try connecting to the secondary server.   4. During the course of investigation, it was observed that NSE Colocation Guidelines were initially issued on August 8, 2011 and then revised from time to time. It was further observed that NSE vide email dated June 20, 2018, had inter alia clarified that the Colocation Guidelines were sent as a welcome email to all new Members in Colocation. The NSE colocation Guidelines sent to stock______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Crosseas Capital Services Private Limited Page 3 of 17  brokers read as \"\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.in case of non-availability of data from TBT primary source they can move to secondary source\".   5. It was also observed that in an email dated December 02, 2011, from NSE COLO, it was stated that \\\\\\\\u201cthe member should intimate the exchange before connecting to the secondary server.\\\\\\\\u201d  It was further observed that Mr. N Muralidharan (former CTO of NSE), in his statement recorded with SEBI on May 16, 2018, had submitted that \\\\\\\\u201cunder normal circumstances, a member would connect to the primary POP and in case of any issue with the primary server or connection, the member can fall back to the secondary server for business continuity.\\\\\\\\u201d  6. It has been observed by the investigation team that E&Y in its report had observed that Crosseas had connected to secondary server on 66 days and not 76 as mentioned by Deloitte in the year 2014 in CM Segment. Thus, in spite of Colocation Guidelines issued by NSE issued from time to time, Crosseas deliberately connected to the secondary server on 66 days in the year 2014 in CM Segment without even attempting to connect to the primary server.  In this regard, login data was provided by NSE. This is confirmed from logs provided by Crosseas itself.    7. In view of the above findings and after considering the submission of Crosseas vide its letter dated March 07, 2017 and the response of Mr. Rajesh Bageti, Director of Crosseas, who recorded his statement with SEBI on July 31, 2017 and March 14, 2018, it has been alleged that in spite of Colocation Guidelines issued by NSE from time to time specifically mentioning not to connect to secondary server unless disconnection issue with primary server, Crosseas deliberately connected to the secondary server on 66 days in the year 2014 in the cash market segment without even attempting to connect to the primary server. Thus, Crosseas has violated Clause A(2) of the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II of Regulation 9 read with Regulation 26 (xvi) of the SEBI (Stock-Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SBSB Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019). The text of the said provisions read as under:  SBSB Regulations, 1992 Conditions of registration. 9. Any registration granted by the Board under regulation 6 shall be subject to the following conditions, namely,- (a) the stock broker holds the membership of any stock exchange; (b) he shall abide by the rules, regulations and bye-laws of the stock exchange which are applicable to him; (c) where the stock broker proposes change in control, he shall obtain prior approval of the Board for continuing to act as such after the change; (d) he shall pay fees charged by the Board in the manner provided in these regulations; (e) he shall take adequate steps for redressal of grievances, of the investors within one month of the date of receipt of the complaint and inform the Board as and when required by the Board;______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Crosseas Capital Services Private Limited Page 4 of 17  (f) he shall at all times abide by the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II; and (g) he shall at all times maintain the minimum networth as specified in Schedule VI.  Liability for monetary penalty. 26. A stock broker or a sub-broker shall be liable for monetary penalty in respect of the following violations, namely\\\\\\\\u2014 (i) \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026 (xvi) Failure to exercise due skill, care and diligence.

(1) \\\\\\\\u2026 (2) Exercise of due skill and care: A stock-broker shall act with due skill, care and diligence in the conduct of all his business.  8. Pursuant to submission of investigation report, the competent authority in SEBI prima facie felt satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to inquire and adjudicate the aforesaid alleged violations by the Noticee and appointed Shri Santosh Kumar Shukla, Chief General Manager as Adjudicating Officer (\\\\\\\\u2018erstwhile AO\\\\\\\\u2019) vide communication order dated October 17, 2018, to inquire and adjudge under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018the Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) the alleged violations by the Noticee under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act. Thereafter, vide a common communication order dated January 07, 2020, this case has been transferred to the undersigned with advise that except for the change of the Adjudicating Officer the other terms and conditions of the original orders \\\\\\\\u2018shall remain unchanged and shall be in full force and effect\\\\\\\\u2019 and that the \\\\\\\\u201cAdjudicating Officer shall proceed in accordance with the terms of reference made in the original orders\\\\\\\\u201d.   9. After receipt of records of these proceedings, it was noted that the erstwhile AO had issued the notice to show cause no. EAD-2/SS-SKS/OW/34000/1/2018 dated December 10, 2018 (\\\\\\\\u2018the SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) to the Noticee in terms of Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules read with section 15I of the SEBI Act calling upon it to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against it in terms of rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules and penalty be not imposed under Section 15HB of the SEBI______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Crosseas Capital Services Private Limited Page 5 of 17  Act for the aforesaid alleged violations. The SCN was sent at the last known address of the Noticee through Speed Post with Acknowledgment Due and the same was duly served.   10. In response to the SCN, the Noticee vide letter dated December 31, 2018, requested for inspection of all the documents/records relevant to or supporting or adverse to the charges levelled against it in the SCN in the matter. Subsequently, the Noticee vide its letter dated January 15, 2019, informed that it had filed settlement application with SEBI on January 14, 2019 and provided a copy of the same. Later, the concerned department of SEBI had confirmed that the settlement application filed by the Noticee was not considered and returned back. In view of the same, the matter was processed for continuance of the instant proceedings. It is pertinent to note that, at that point of time, the request of the Noticee for inspection of documents was outstanding on record. Therefore, the erstwhile AO allowed the inspection of the documents/records in connection with the matter and referred Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s request to the concerned department in SEBI and the inspection of documents was carried out by the Noticee on November 04, 2019. From the proceedings of inspection of documents, it is noted that Authorized Representatives of the Noticee have contended that \\\\\\\\u2013 (i) Annexure 10 (2) has not been received along with the SCN and other annexures; (ii) All the documents sought for inspection vide letter dated December 31, 2018 were not provided. In this regard, erstwhile AO informed the Noticee that the said Annexure 10 (2) forms part of Annexure-1 to the SCN i.e. E&Y Report submitted to NSE on May 18, 2018 and since, the Noticee has claimed that it has not received the said Annexure 10 (2), the same was again provided by the erstwhile AO for its reference. Subsequently, the Noticee vide letter dated November 14, 2019, contended that documents sought for inspection vide letter dated December 31, 2018 were not provided and again made a generic request to allow inspection of certain documents that are neither relied upon by SEBI nor are relevant to the proceedings. Vide letter dated December 16, 2019, the request of the Noticee was declined and was communicated to it with reasons stated therein.  In the said letter dated December 16, 2019, Noticee was allowed additional time till December 31, 2019 for submission of its reply on merits and opportunity of hearing was granted on January 15, 2020. In response to the said letter dated December 16, 2019, the Noticee vide letter dated December 24, 2019, sought six weeks\\\\\\\\u2019 extension of time to file its reply to the SCN as its Director Mr. Rajesh Baheti was out of country.  11. As substantial time has elapsed, in the interest of principles of natural justice and considering the material available on record, the undersigned granted the Noticee another opportunity to file its reply on merits on or before February 10, 2020 and had further granted an opportunity of personal hearing on February 14, 2020. Thereafter, vide letter dated February 10, 2020 filed its interim reply and vide letter dated February 12, 2020, the Noticee informed that it has resubmitted settlement application (without admitting guilt). Pursuant to the same, comments of Settlement Division in______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Crosseas Capital Services Private Limited Page 6 of 17  SEBI was sought vide e-mail dated February 20, 2020 to decide future course of action in the matter. Thereafter, the concerned division in SEBI informed that the settlement application was not considered and returned back to the Noticee. In view of the same, the matter was again processed for continuance of the instant proceedings.   12. Vide Notice of hearing dated July 29, 2020, a second opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on August 10, 2020. In response to the said Notice, vide e-mail dated August 10, 2020 i.e. on the date of hearing, the Noticee filed final interim reply and again sought adjournment of personal hearing and also sought inspection of documents and opportunity of cross-examination. Vide Notice of hearing dated September 14, 2020, the Noticee was informed that its contention on inspection of documents was considered by the erstwhile AO and declined the request vide SEBI letter dated December 16, 2019 and that the undersigned do not find any reason to differ with the opinion of the erstwhile AO. Vide the said Notice of hearing dated September 14, 2020, the Noticee was further informed that besides this contention, if any issue remains open, the same will be dealt appropriately at the time of disposal of the matter and granted a final opportunity of hearing on September 25, 2020. In response to the Notice of hearing, the Noticee again filed another final interim submission vide e-mail dated September 24, 2020, and availed the opportunity of hearing granted to it through WebEx platform on September 25, 2020, when Mr. Rajesh Baheti, Director, Authorized Representative (\\\\\\\\u2018AR\\\\\\\\u2019) of the Noticee appeared on its behalf and made oral submissions on the lines of written reply filed by the Noticee vide letters dated September 24, 2020, August 07, 2020 & February 10, 2020. In support of his argument, the AR also placed reliance on two orders passed by SEBI Adjudicating Officers on the subject matter of connecting to the secondary server of NSE which is the basis of the charge.   13. The written/oral replies/submissions of the Noticee inter-alia are summarised as follows:  a) The NSE Co- location (\"Colo'' or \"NSE Colo\") service is a legal, paid premium services to get tick by tick and data faster and any broker / Trading Member (TM) who has availed the Colo facility has an advantage over those who have not availed the Colo facility. The entire purpose of availing the Colo facility is high speed connectivity. Different data dissemination infrastructure speed is approved by SEBI and it is not required that different market participants need to have equal access to data dissemination speeds.  b) Para 7 of the SCN states that \"it has been observed by the investigation team that E&Y in its reports had observed that Crosseas had connected to secondary server on 66 days and not 76 as mentioned in by Deloitte in the year 2019 in the CM Segment\". It is clear from this that the SCN proceeds on contradictory observations in the expert report which was obtained by SEBI.______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Crosseas Capital Services Private Limited Page 7 of 17   c) The SCN at various places primarily relies upon the E&Y and Deloitte reports and bases its allegations qua Noticee from said report. In this regard, it highlighted the following disclaimers mentioned by these Auditors in their reports-  a.   \"VI.  Whilst we have taken reasonable steps to corroborate the information obtained, we cannot guarantee its accuracy or reliability or completeness. ... It should not form the sole basis for any decision as to a  potential course of action without independent confirmation of its findings. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d Page 3 note to reader- Deloitte Report. b.  The E&Y report categorically states that \"The findings in the report are not exhaustive in view of the fact that only specific sample of documents were reviewed.  The report has not ruled out the possibility that their observations may have been different had they reviewed the whole documentation and information on the matter.\"  From the above, it is obvious that if the material on the basis of which an entity has been alleged to have violated certain provisions of law is not full proof and has deficiencies, such material cannot ever be the basis for prosecuting a Noticee unless it is backed by some other solid evidence, which is absent in this case. Not only this, it has not yet been given inspection of these original reports and also cross examination of these auditors.  d) It had gathered that SEBI had issued SCNs in the NSE Colo matter to several other entities.  During the course of proceedings for one such entity, OPG Securities, a report, commissioned by Accel Trading and conducted by Indian Institute of Technology Madras professor Ramakrishna Pasumarthy, was submitted to SEBI which counters the findings of separate investigations into this matter that SEBI had conducted over three years.  This report establishes that far from benefitting from alleged preferential access or secondary connections, OPG made lesser profits from secondary connections.  A copy of this report is provided.  e) NSE's Circular dated August 31, 2009 (Ref: NSE/MEM/12985) in respect of Colocation facility contained no restriction on the usage of secondary server access. Till date, this is the only circular issued by NSE on colocation facility and the same merely informs the members of the introduction of the colocation services at the NSE premises. It only provides information as to the facilities that will be available at the colocation and the process for member applications.  f) NSE Colocation Guidelines Document No. NSEIL/ITSM/INT/072 dated August 08, 2011 (\"Colocation Guidelines\") - contained no reference at all as regards the utilization of the Secondary Server. The updated Colocation Guidelines (as on April 16, 2012) wherein one of______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Crosseas Capital Services Private Limited Page 8 of 17  the 'processes'  (which were in the nature of guidance/tips) made a reference to the Secondary  Server   while  stating  that  \"Member 's   should  always  check  the secondary  TBT  parameters are working fine with their application  in case of non-availability of data from TBT primary source they can move to secondary source\"  Thus, the updated 2012 Colocation Guidelines, that contained these 'processes' for improving the experience to TMs on the Colocation platform were only in the form of guidelines / tips provided by NSE and were not binding  upon the TMs. It only advised the TMs to connect to the Secondary Server for smooth functioning and did not bar the same as mentioned in the SCN. Also, the only way to check whether the TBT parameters were working fine with the application was by initiating a secondary server login and staying connected to it. Moreover, such guidelines were not available in public domain due to which it was unaware of the circumstances in which it could connect to the secondary server.  g) In the absence of any regulation or norm in relation to the usage of the secondary server, there cannot be any allegation or questioning around the manner of connecting to the Secondary Server for reprimanding or punishing a TM accessing the Secondary Server. (Kalpena Plastiks Limited vs BSE - SAT Order).  h) Para 5 of the SCN stated that \"NSE vide e-mail dated June 20, 2018 had inter alia clarified that the Colocation guidelines were sent as a welcome e-mail to all new Members in Colocation.  The NSE colocation guidelines sent to stock brokers read as \"........in case of non-availability of data from TBT primary source they can move to secondary source\". The alleged violation against it FY 2014 and during that time there were no clear instructions from NSE on the usage of the secondary server.  i) The SCN states that an e-mail dated December 2, 2011 from NSE Colo stated that \"the members should intimate the exchange before connecting to secondary sever\". In this regard, it refers to NSE's submissions made in the proceedings before the Whole Time Member, in the case of NSE Co-location that the secondary server was always in 'active mode' and that the TMs were free to connect to the secondary server at all times, based on such TM's considerations. It was even clarified that NSE advised the TMs to stay connected to both - primary and secondary servers to avoid suffering due to server failure [Reference - Para 8.2.16.3. of Order no. WTM/GM/EFD/03/2018-19 dated April 30, 2019 passed by Hon'ble Shri  G. Mahalingam,   Whole  Time  Member- In  the  matter  of  NSE  Co-location (\"WTM Order\")].  j) SEBI has itself admitted that there was no restriction, regulation or conditions regarding the usage and connection of the secondary server and that NSE had left the usage thereof to the discretion of the TMs (Reference - WTM Order in the matter of NSE Colocation)______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Crosseas Capital Services Private Limited Page 9 of 17  k) Large number of TMs, almost all on colocation, were connecting to the secondary server constantly. Had there been any restriction or regulation or rules setting out the conditions for secondary server access, none of the TMs would be connecting to the secondary server as frequently.  For the same reason, NSE maintained no policing system, and therefore NSE  never 'warned'  or  'reprimanded'  any TM for connecting  to secondary server for the larger period of the TCP-IP regime, despite the fact that most of the Secondary Server connections   were established by the TMs before the market opening hours.  l) The E&Y report came to a specific finding that there were 53 members who accessed   Secondary   Servers   and   were   reprimanded   by   NSE.   Several members were not reprimanded despite having accessed Secondary Servers. Several members continued to access secondary servers despite being reprimanded. Based on these facts, the EY Report recorded an observation that \"it appears that all members may have been granted access to secondary server equitably\".  m) Several TMs had continuously raised complaints with NSE regarding disconnections, invariable latency and even receipt of incorrect data, even till 2014.  For instance, email dated September 23, 2015 from VR Narasimhan of NSE to Vikas Komera of SEBI, (Annexure 1 to CFT Report) states as under:  \"Point 5 - 'Details of Complaints received w.r.t. colo from members:  All tickets relating to TBT \"250+ (nearly every day) complaints raised by various members over 357 days\\\\\\\\u2019 period of alleged violation recorded on telephone at NSE Colo Support helpdesk related to issues with the primary infrastructure during the period of alleged violations. (Dec '12-  May' 14)\"  n) The nature of the TCP-IP dissemination system was dynamic and variable - the ticks/trade data never travel in a pre-defined sequence. There is difference in 'dissemination of a tick' and 'receipt of a tick'.  Even if a tick is disseminated first to a particular POP Server, a port connected to a different POP Server may receive data first. Therefore, there is no way for a TM to ensure early/ speedy receipt of ticks. TAC Report itself states that the Secondary Server   receives ticks after the Primary Server. (Reference- SEBI TAC report)  o) Colo is a legitimate paid facility to allow faster access to data w.r.t. those who are not in Colo. Therefore, the question of preferential data cannot be applied w.r.t. any non Colo access. Besides, the Colo facility was available only for Algo trading, and as such no \"investor\" was accessing the Colo facility, but rather algorithmic traders. Irrespective of whether a member accessed the primary or secondary server, by virtue of being in Colo, he had faster access to data than anyone who was not in Colo (i.e. investors). Thus, there cannot be a case that______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Crosseas Capital Services Private Limited Page 10 of 17  \"investors\" were put at a disadvantage on account of secondary server login, or that they suffered any loss on this count.  p) The norms for login to the secondary server, even if interpreted as per SEBI's stand allows use of secondary server in case of failure of primary line. The solitary email w.r.t. secondary server exchanged between it and NSE mentioned use of secondary line in case of failure or primary line. What does \"failure\" mean in this context? Failure to provide all the packets of data while charging a premium price for Colo also comprises failure. It logged on to the secondary server only because neither the primary nor the secondary servers by themselves provided consecutive packets of data. It could make a more accurate order book only by combining the 2 server packets. Therefore, the secondary server login was not about speed, but accuracy. After paying a premium price, it was entitled to accurate data without the same its Algo can't function and will fail.  q) If the secondary server was indeed providing it with any edge, it would have put all its servers on the secondary server. It is seen that on any given day where it had secondary login, it also had primary login, thus proving that it required both for accuracy and not speed.  r) By 2012, NSE had stopped monitoring connections and that most brokers at Colo used secondary server, which means all were on equal footing anyways. It only logged it to the secondary servers since 2014, by which time login to the secondary server had become a routine practice amongst all the Colo participants. NSE had already defacto accepted the same as a regular practice, which is the reason it was never reprimanded by NSE even once. Various tests/reports have not proved that there was any speed advantage enjoyed by anyone on secondary vs primary.   s) One such TM/ Broker SMC Global Securities Ltd had also connected to the secondary server on fallback server on 146 days in the F&O segment and 603 days in the cash segment between the years 2011-2015 with 4 reprimands from NSE. The details of logins of SMC mentioned in order no. EAD-2/SS/SK/44/90/2019-20 dated 25th September, 2019 passed by Adjudicating Officer Shri Santosh Shukla in proceeding held against SMC.  t) It may be noted that Adjudicating Officer, Hon'ble Shri. Santosh Shukla, in the matter of SMC has imposed a penalty of R s. 5 lacs (Rupees Five Lacs only) on SMC despite having logged on to the secondary servers many more times than it in the present matter and also after having been reprimanded by NSE on several occasions. The AO has supported this decision by stating that \"any quantifiable gain or unfair advantage accrued to the Noticee or the extent of loss suffered by the investors as a result of the default in this case cannot be computed. There are no investor/s complaints on record arising out of such defaults.\" Kindly note that there is no allegation of unfair advantage accrued /______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in the matter of Crosseas Capital Services Private Limited Page 11 of 17  loss suffered by investors in the instant matter. Also, there are no investor complaints against it. The said Order of Hon'ble Shri. Santosh Shukla has been accepted and has not been reviewed by SEBI. Therefore, it becomes a binding judgement.     u) Further, it placed reliance on a recent Order dated September 22, 2020 passed by the Adjudicating officer- Hon'ble Maninder Cheema in respect of Advent Stock Broking Pvt. Ltd in the matter of NSE Co-Location. In this matter, the broker had connected to the secondary server on- 238 days in the cash segment and 17 days in the F&O segment.  The details of logins of the Advent Stock Broking Pvt. Ltd are mentioned in the Order bearing no. Order/MC/DS/2020-2021/9097. Advent Stock Broking Pvt. Ltd has also been charged with alleged violation of Point 2(a) of Chapter V of NSE bye-laws read with Clause A(5) of the Code of Conduct specified under Schedule II read with regulation 9(f) of the Stock Broker Regulations, Clause A(2) of the Code of Conduct specified under Schedule II read with Regulation 9(f) of the Stock Broker Regulations.  v) The Hon'ble AO - Maninder Cheema in the above matter has imposed penalty of only Rs. 1 lakh for the violation of Point 2(a) of Chapter V of NSE bye-laws read with Clause A(5) of the Code of Conduct specified under Schedule II read with regulation 9(f) of the Stock Broker Regulations, Clause A(2) of the Code of Conduct specified under Schedule II read with Regulation 9(f) of the Stock Broker Regulations. They were also not reprimanded.by NSE.  w) Keeping in mind the decisions taken by the Adjudicating officers in the matter of SMC and Advent Stock Broking Pvt Ltd., and considering the fact that it does not have as many logins to secondary server as either SMC or Advent Stock Broking Pvt.  Ltd, and was not reprimanded even once, and the fact that these logins were done only for accuracy of TBT data, and that there was no gain or unfair advantage which accrued to it, it is requested to\\\\\\\\xb7 look into the facts and dispose of the matter without levying of any penalty.  x) The investigation referred to in the SCN only talks about investigation into collusion between NSE officials and brokers. The SCN does not allege any collusion by it. It may be noted that just like in the matter of SMC Global, it has been charged only for violation of code of conduct for brokers only. There is no charge of fraud against it. It did not \"deliberately\" login on secondary servers on 66 occasions but", "Date": "2020-11-25", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Adjudication Order in the matter of Crosseas Capital Services Private Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/nov-2020/adjudication-order-in-the-matter-of-crosseas-capital-services-private-limited_48272.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 57248, "unique_record_id": "f5a29c1aaaSEBI20201125", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "66804f5378589103064711ba", "parse_date": "2024-06-29 18:15:14", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Non-compliance", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "Rs. 5,00,000", "gpt_audience": "- Regulatory authorities (e.g., SEBI)\n- Stock brokers and trading members\n- Legal professionals and compliance officers\n- Financial auditors and forensic investigators\n- Stock exchanges (e.g., NSE, BSE)\n- Investors and market participants\n- Financial journalists and analysts", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter, SEBI) vide Circular No. CIR/OIAE/2/2011 dated June 03, 2011, directed all listed companies to obtain SEBI Complaints Redressal System (hereinafter, SCORES) authentication and also redress any pending investor grievances in that platform only. Subsequently, SEBI also vide Circulars No CIR/OIAE/1/2012 dated August 13, 2012, No. CIR/OIAE/1/2013 dated April 17, 2013 and No CIR/OIAE/1/2014 dated December 18, 2014, (hereinafter, SEBI circulars) inter-alia directed all companies whose securities were listed on stock exchanges to obtain SCORES authentication within a period of 30 days from the date of issue of this circular and also to redress the pending investor grievances within the stipulated time period. 2. It was alleged that Shreeji Industries Limited (hereinafter, Noticee/Company) had failed to obtain the SCORES authentication and to redress investor grievances pending therein within the timelines stipulated by SEBI, therefore not complying with the aforesaid SEBI Circulars.Adjudication Order in respect of Shreeji Industries  Limited                                                                                    Page 2 of 8        APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  3. The undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer (\\\\\\\\u2018AO\\\\\\\\u2019) vide order dated June 12, 2019, under Section 19 read with Section 15-I of Securities and Exchange Board of India, 1992 (hereinafter, \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and under Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter, Rules) to enquire into and adjudge under Section 15HB and Section 15C of the SEBI Act, for the aforementioned alleged violations by the Noticee. Earlier, the case was assigned to Shri Sudeep Mishra and Shri Achal Singh. I therefore proceed in the matter from where it had been left by the previous Adjudicating Officer.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 4. A Show Cause Notice dated September 22, 2020 (hereinafter, SCN) was issued by the undersigned to the Noticee under Rule 4 of the Rules, calling it to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against it in terms of Rule 4 of the Rules, read with Section 15-I of SEBI Act and penalty be not imposed on it under Section 15HB and Section 15C of the SEBI Act for allegedly failing to obtain the SCORES authentication and to redress investor grievances pending therein, within the timelines stipulated by SEBI, respectively. The SCN was sent via digitally signed email to the Noticee on its email obtained from MCA website. The SCN was duly delivered to the Noticee, however no reply was received from the Noticee.   5. Subsequently, in the interest of natural justice, the Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing on October 21, 2020 vide Hearing Notice dated October 12, 2020. The said Hearing Notice was sent vide digitally signed email dated October 13, 2020 and was duly delivered to the Noticee. It is pertinent to mention here that vide the aforesaid notice it was clearly indicated that in case of failure to appear before the undersigned, the case would be proceeded with ex-parte on the basis of the material available on record. However, the Noticee neither appeared for the said hearing nor filed any reply in this regard.Adjudication Order in respect of Shreeji Industries  Limited                                                                                    Page 3 of 8       6. Considering the fact that the Noticee has not availed the opportunity of personal hearing despite being granted opportunities for the same, I am of the view that the Noticee has nothing more to submit, and in terms of rule 4(7) of the Rules, the matter can be proceeded ex-parte on the basis of material available on record.  ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS 7. Given the aforesaid, I proceed in the matter on the basis of the material available on records and the issues that arise for consideration in the present case are:  a. Whether the Noticee had failed to obtain the SCORES authentication and to redress investor grievances pending therein within the timelines stipulated by SEBI, thereby failed to comply with SEBI circulars dated June 03, 2011, August 13, 2012 and April 17, 2013? b. Does the violation, if any, on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under Section 15 HB and 15 C of the SEBI Act? c. If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15 J of the SEBI Act?   8. While recording my finding, it is pertinent to have a brief narration on SCORES and its applicable circulars.  9. SEBI commenced its web based investor grievance redressal portal, SCORES, in June 2011 to enhance investor protection, enabling investors to lodge their complaint against listed companies either through \\\\\\\\u2018on-line\\\\\\\\u2019 or physical mode and thereafter monitor its status on 24 X 7 basis. Complaints received by SEBI / in SCORES are electronically forwarded to the listed company / its Share Transfer Agent (hereinafter, STA), which in turn is required to redress the same and furnish the ATR in electronic form. However, as a prerequisite to access SCORES portal, listed companies have to obtain user ID and login password from SEBI by providing specified information to the latter (hereinafter, \\\\\\\\u201cSCORES authentication\\\\\\\\u201d). The foregoing was spelt out in the SEBI Circular No.Adjudication Order in respect of Shreeji Industries  Limited                                                                                    Page 4 of 8       CIR/OIAE/2/2011 dated June 03, 2011 which also provided the format in its annexure, for listed companies to provide information to the former to obtain authentication.  10. SEBI circular No. CIR/OIAE/1/2012 dated August 13, 2012, inter-alia, reiterated the contents of the June 2011 circular and fixed September 14, 2012 as the last date for obtaining SCORES authentication. From the material available on records, I find that the Noticee had not obtained SCORES Authentication till date. Further, I note that the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Port Shipping Company Ltd. vs. SEBI (decided on April 29, 2015) observed that:  \\\\\\\\u201c...where a listed company fails to obtain SCORES authentication within the time stipulated by SEBI, then it amounts to violating the directions of SEBI and in such a case penalty is imposable under Section 15HB of SEBI Act...\\\\\\\\u201d  11. Redressal of investor grievances in SCORES is distinct from obtaining authentication. Accordingly, SEBI Circular No. CIR/OIAE/1/2013 dated April 17, 2013, inter-alia, reiterated the contents of June 2011 Circular and by way of standing order, \\\\\\\\u201ccalled upon\\\\\\\\u201d listed companies to redress investor grievances in SCORES within 30 days, thereby enabling SEBI to impose penalty u/s 15 C of SEBI Act in case of their failure to do so. Further, SEBI Circular No. CIR/OIAE/1/2014 dated December 18, 2014, inter-alia, extended SCORES platform to specified intermediaries, and also called upon \\\\\\\\u2018newly listed companies\\\\\\\\u2019 to redress investors\\\\\\\\u2019 grievances through this portal. Also, SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, notified on September 02, 2015 and came into force 90 days thereafter, subsumed the September 2012 Circular. 12. As already noted, bereft of authentication, redressal of investor grievance cannot happen in SCORES. In this regard, I find that despite SEBI forewarning the Noticee repeatedly through issue of various circulars and in letters in the matter, the Noticee which was a listed company at the relevant period of time did not pay heed to the same and consistently failed and neglected to comply with the SEBI Circulars for obtaining a Login ID and password till March 2014. Further, this proceeding was initiated, inter-alia, on the allegation that oneAdjudication Order in respect of Shreeji Industries  Limited                                                                                    Page 5 of 8       grievance of investor was pending for redressal. From the material available on record, I observe that Noticee had failed to resolve the complaint within the timeline specified by SEBI. I observe that SEBI is inter-alia entrusted with the task of ensuring speedy resolution of investor grievances and to achieve the same, SEBI has provided a centralized web portal viz. SCORES wherein unresolved grievances pertaining to securities market are registered. However, I note that the Noticee Company had consistently failed to comply with the provisions of SEBI Consolidated Circular CIR/OIAE/1/2014 dated December 18, 2014 for obtaining a Login ID and password within timeline. As already stated above, the Circular dated April 17, 2013 had inter alia stipulated that:  \\\\\\\\u201cFailure to obtain the SCORES user ID and password within 30 days of issue of this circular would not only be deemed as non redressal of investor grievances but also indicate wilful avoidance of the same.\\\\\\\\u201d  13. Thus, the aforesaid non-compliance to SEBI circulars dated August 13, 2012 and April 17, 2013 render the Noticee liable for penalty under section 15 C of the SEBI Act. 14. The provisions of section 15HB and 15C of the SEBI Act is reproduced herein below:  15HB - Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided  Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which may extend to one crore rupees The penalty amount was amended as \\\\\\\\u201cliable to penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees, by the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014, w.e.f. 08-09-2014.  15C - Penalty for failure to redress investors\\\\\\\\u2019 grievances If any listed company or any person who is registered as an intermediary, after having been called upon by the Board in writing, to redress the grievances of investors, fails to redress such grievances within the time specified by the Board, such company or intermediary shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less.Adjudication Order in respect of Shreeji Industries  Limited                                                                                    Page 6 of 8        The penalty amount was amended as \\\\\\\\u201cwhich shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees\\\\\\\\u201d, by the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014, w.e.f. 08-09-2014.  15. As per the dates of defaults, Section 15HB and 15C of SEBI Act, as they stood prior to their amendments, respectively, are applicable for not obtaining authentication and non-redressal of grievance, respectively. Nevertheless, guided by the principle of rule of beneficial construction of even ex post facto law to mitigate the rigour of law, as was laid by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in T. Barai vs. Henry Ah Hoe and Ors. (07.12.1982 -SC): MANU/SC/0123/1982 -(1983)1SCC177, the amended version of section 15C of SEBI Act is applied for the investor grievance which was not redressed during the stipulated period of time. 16. While determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15 HB and Section 15C of SEBI Act as aforesaid, provisions of Section 15J of SEBI Act would be applicable, which read as under: - [Factors to be taken into account while adjudging quantum of penalty.] 15J. While adjudging quantum of penalty under 15-I or section 11 or section 11B, the Board or the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely: \\\\\\\\u2014 (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default. Explanation. \\\\\\\\u2014 For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E, clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.  17. With regard to the above factors to be considered while determining the quantum of penalty, it is noted that the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee or lossAdjudication Order in respect of Shreeji Industries  Limited                                                                                    Page 7 of 8       caused to the investors as a result of the failure on the part of the Noticee to redress the grievance and for filing the ATR with SEBI, are not available on record. As regards the repetitive nature of the default, as already observed, the Noticee had failed to obtained SCORES authentication till date and had also not redressed the pending grievance of one investor within the timeline specified by SEBI. Such persistent non-compliance does not inspire confidence of investors in the market, whose protection is SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s prime mandate.  ORDER 18. After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, I impose a penalty of Rs. 1,00,000/-  under Section 15 HB of the SEBI Act and Rs. 1,00,000/- under section 15C of the SEBI Act, i.e.  penalties totaling to Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rrupees Two Lacs) against Shreeji Industries Limited, which will be commensurate with its non-compliances.    19. The Noticees shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR through online payment facility available on the website of SEBI, i.e. www.sebi.gov.in on the following path, by clicking on the payment link: ENFORCEMENT \\\\\\\\uf0e0 Orders \\\\\\\\uf0e0 Orders of AO \\\\\\\\uf0e0 PAY NOW. 20.

The new accounting standard Ind AS 115 was introduced and is applicable to real estate companies. The Ind AS 115 was introduced from FY 2018-19, so this is being implemented for the first time with respect to the real estate companies. As Company is engaged in real estate activities, Ind AS 115 was applicable on the Company from FY 2018-19. Being newly introduced accounting standard, which required the restatement of accounts for the current year and previous year, checking and auditing of the same by the Auditors, the Company meticulously undertook to finalise the Financial Statements as per the prescribed standards.Adjudication Order in respect of Kapstone Constructions Pvt. Ltd.                                                                 Page 3 of 10        The Company has only two debenture holders (i) Company\\\\\\\\u2019s holding company and (ii) another is an Investor. As Company is private limited Company and has only one outsider debenture holder, who is well informed of applicability of new accounting standard (Ind AS 115) no party has been adversely affected. It may further be noted that the Company has filed its audited financial statements for the period ending March 31, 2019 with the Stock Exchange on September 28, 2019.  5. Subsequently, in the interest of natural justice and in order to conduct an inquiry in terms of Rule 4 (3) of the Adjudication Rules, vide email dated September 14, 2020, the Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing on September 24, 2020. The said hearing was attended by the Authorized Representative (AR) of the Noticee in which it reiterated its earlier submissions made vide its email dated September 10, 2020.  6. Taking into account the aforesaid facts, I am of the view that principle of natural justice has been followed in the matter by granting the Noticee ample opportunities for replying to the SCN and of being heard. Therefore, I deem it appropriate to decide the matter on the basis of facts/material available on record and replies submitted by the Noticee.  ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS 7. I have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case and the material available on record and the issues that arise for consideration in the present case are: a. Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of the LODR Regulations?  b. Does the violation, if any, on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under Section 15 A(b) of the SEBI Act? c. If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15 J of the SEBI Act?   8.

Provided further that the requirement of this sub-regulation shall not be applicable in case of unsecured debt instruments issued by regulated financial sector entities eligible for meeting capital requirements as specified by respective regulators.\\\\\\\\u201d  Regulation 52(5) \\\\\\\\u201cThe listed entity shall within seven working days from the date of submission of the information required under sub-regulation (4), submit to stock exchange(s), a certificate signed by debenture trustee that it has taken note of the contents\\\\\\\\u201d Prior to May 07, 2019, the aforesaid sub-regulation 5 of Regulation 52 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 read as \\\\\\\\u201cWhile submitting the information required under sub-regulation (4), the listed entity shall submit to stock exchange(s), a certificate signed by debenture trustee that it has taken note of the contents\\\\\\\\u201d.  FINDINGS 9. The first issue for consideration is whether the Noticee has violated Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of the LODR Regulations. 10. It may be noted that Regulation 52(1) of LODR Regulations provides for submission of the financial results within forty-five days from the end of the half year. Further, Regulation 52(4) provides for disclosure of certain line items along with the half yearly / annual financial results, while Regulation 52(5) provides for submission of a Certificate signed by the Debenture Trustee taking note of the contents prescribed under Regulation 52(4). 11. From the fact of the case, I observe that in pursuance of the reference of Vistra, SEBI sought information from Exchanges (NSE and BSE) regarding the compliance status of the NoticeeAdjudication Order in respect of Kapstone Constructions Pvt. Ltd.                                                                 Page 6 of 10        with respect to Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations for the half year ended March 31, 2019. From the submissions of the BSE vide its email dated October 07, 2019 and March 11, 2020, it was observed that the company has not complied with provisions of Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations. 12. Further, the Noticee vide its reply dated September 10, 2020 submitted that they had disclosed their audited financial results under Regulation 52(1) along with line items under Regulation 52(4) of LODR Regulations to BSE on September 28, 2019. Since the said disclosure was not done within the specified timeline of 45 days under the Regulation, I observe that the Noticee had failed to comply with Regulation 52(1) and 52(4) of LODR Regulation. 13. Further, regarding Regulation 52(5) of LODR Regulations, from the material available on record, I note that the Noticee had submitted to stock exchange, the certificate signed by debenture trustee that it has taken note of the contents prescribed under Regulation 52(4) on October 03, 2019, which is within seven working days from the date of submission of the information required under sub-regulation (4) i.e. September 28, 2019.  Hence, I note that the Notice has complied with Regulation 52(5) of LODR Regulation. 14. In its reply to the SCN, the Noticee had contended that the Company has only two debenture holders and it has only one outsider debenture holder, who is well informed of applicability of new accounting standard (Ind AS 115) no party has been adversely affected. In this context, I note that it is crucial to mention here that financial statements are important because they contain significant information about a company's financial health. They are the barometer of a company's operations. Investors depend on the truth and fairness in the financial statements to make informed decisions. Moreover, it is not only investors, but a lot of stakeholders like operational creditors and lending institutions like banks that need to gauge the profitability and track record before opening up lines of credit to a company. 15. Further, timely disclosure of relevant information by listed companies is essential for maintaining transparency about the affairs of the Company which helps in eliminating information asymmetry. Moreover, correct and timely disclosures play an essential role inAdjudication Order in respect of Kapstone Constructions Pvt. Ltd.                                                                 Page 7 of 10        the proper functioning of the securities market and failure to do so results in depriving the investors from taking well informed investment decision. In this context, I would like to rely on observation of Hon'ble SAT in the matter of Coimbatore Flavors & Fragrances Ltd. vs SEBI (Appeal No. 209 of 2014 order dated August 11, 2014) wherein it was held that \\\\\\\\u201cUndoubtedly, the purpose of these disclosures is to bring about more transparency in the affairs of the companies. True and timely disclosures by a company or its promoters are very essential from two angles. Firstly; investors can take a more informed decision to invest or not to invest in a particular scrip secondly; the Regulator can properly monitor the transactions in the capital market to effectively regulate the same.\" 16. Based on the aforesaid findings, I conclude that the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulations 52(1) and 52(4) of LODR Regulations. 17.  I further note that Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India, in the matter of Chairman, SEBI vs. Shriram Mutual Fund {[2006] 5 SCC 361} held that \"In our view, the penalty is attracted as soon as contravention of the statutory obligations as contemplated by the Act is established and, therefore, the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes immaterial. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. Hence, we are of the view that once the contravention is established, then the penalty has to follow and only the quantum of penalty is discretionary\\\\\\\\u201d.  18. In view of the foregoing, I am convinced that the Noticee is thus liable for monetary penalty under Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act for violation of Regulations 52(1) and 52(4) of the LODR Regulations. The provisions of Section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read as under: SEBI Act 15A - \\\\\\\\u201cPenalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. \\\\\\\\u2013  If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or Regulations made there under-  (a) \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026  (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the Regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the Regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less\\\\\\\\u201d.Adjudication Order in respect of Kapstone Constructions Pvt. Ltd.                                                                 Page 8 of 10        19. While determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, it is important to consider the factors relevantly as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under:- Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer. Section 15J - While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:- (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default. Explanation. \\\\\\\\u2014For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E, clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section. 20. The material available on record has not quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, if any, made by the Noticee and the loss, if any, suffered by the investors as a result of the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s failure. I also note that no prior default of the Noticee is available on record. However, the facts of the case clearly bring out the default made by the Noticee. I note that the Noticee failed to make timely disclosures thereby violated Regulation 52(1) and 52(4) of the LODR Regulations.  ORDER 21. In view of the above, after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and the factors mentioned in the provisions of Section 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 5 of Rules, I hereby impose a penalty of Rs 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two lacs only) on the Noticee viz.  Kapstone Constructions Pvt. Ltd. in terms of the provisions of Section 15A(b) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992.

Page 9 of 10        case, I am of the view that the said penalty is commensurate with the default committed by the Noticee.  22. The Noticees shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR through online payment facility available on the website of SEBI, i.e. www.sebi.gov.in on the following path, by clicking on the payment link: ENFORCEMENT \\\\\\\\uf0e0 Orders \\\\\\\\uf0e0 Orders of AO \\\\\\\\uf0e0 PAY NOW.  23.

In view of the prima facie conduct of the Noticee as stated above, it was alleged that the Noticee was in non-compliance of Regulation 29(1) read with Regulation 29(3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011. Further it was also informed that the aforesaid alleged contravention of the provisions of Regulation 29(1) read with Regulation 29(3) of SEBI    Adjudication Order in respect of Modern Trading Business Private Ltd in the matter of The Byke Hospitlity Limited Page 5 of 10   (SAST) Regulations, 2011, make the Noticee liable for monetary penalty under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, 1992, if established.  5. The SCN was sent by speed post, which had returned undelivered from the address of the Noticee with the remarks \\\\\\\\u201citem returned insufficient address\\\\\\\\u201d. Thereafter, contact details of the Noticee was obtained from the database of Unique Client Codes (\\\\\\\\u201cUCC\\\\\\\\u201d) maintained by the BSE and a scanned copy of the SCN along with the annexure thereto was sent to three email addresses of the Noticee obtained from the UCC details vide email dated October 16, 2020. The Noticee was inter alia advised to reply to the SCN within fourteen days from the date of the receipt of the said email communication. Except from one email address of the Noticee, the said email had not bounced back from the other two email addresses. On receiving no response from the Noticee, vide email dated November 12, 2020, an opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticee on November 20, 2020. The said email too had not bounced back from two of the three email addresses of the Noticee. The Noticee however has failed to respond to the said notice of hearing. As per the rules of Registry of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court and Delhi High Court, service of notice/ documents through email, when the same has not bounced back, is a valid service. Accordingly, I hold that valid service of SCN and hearing notice has been done qua the Noticee, in compliance of the principles of natural justice.  ISSUES AND FINDINGS 6. The issues for consideration of the present case are:    Adjudication Order in respect of Modern Trading Business Private Ltd in the matter of The Byke Hospitlity Limited Page 6 of 10   a. Whether the Noticee has failed to make the requisite disclosure under Regulation 29(1) read with Regulation 29(3) of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011? b. If the answer to the aforesaid question is in the affirmative, does that make the Noticee liable for penalty under Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act, 1992? c. If the answers to the aforementioned questions are in the affirmative, what should be the quantum of penalty in the present case under section 15J of the SEBI Act? 7. The contents of Regulations 29(1) and 29(3) of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011 and section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act is reproduced herein below: SAST Regulations, 2011  Disclosure of acquisition and disposal.  29.(1) Any acquirer who acquires shares or voting rights in a target company which taken together with shares or voting rights, if any, held by him and by persons acting in concert with him in such target company, aggregating to five per cent or more of the shares of such target company, shall disclose their aggregate shareholding and voting rights in such target company in such form as may be specified.  (2)\\\\\\\\u2026 (3). The disclosures required under sub-regulation (1) and sub-regulation (2) shall be made within two working days of the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares, or the acquisition of shares or voting rights in the target company to,\\\\\\\\u2014  (a) every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed; and  (b) the target company at its registered office.  [emphasis supplied]  SEBI Act, 1992    Adjudication Order in respect of Modern Trading Business Private Ltd in the matter of The Byke Hospitlity Limited Page 7 of 10   Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc.  15A. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder,\\\\\\\\u2014 (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations, he shall be liable to [a penalty [which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees]]; 8. On a perusal of the records, I find that the details of the transactions undertaken by the Noticee for the period from December 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, on the basis of statement of account received from CDSL vide email dated 19/11/2019, to be authentic. The details of the said transactions have already been reproduced in the preceding paragraphs in this order. Therefore, it is beyond any dispute that the Noticee had exceeded the limit of acquisition of 5% of the shareholding in the company on December 31, 2016, which necessitated requisite disclosures under Regulations 29(1) read with Regulation 29(3) of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011, to the company and the stock exchanges where the shares of the company are listed, within two working days from the date of receipt of the allotment of shares. As informed by BSE and the company vide communications referred to above, such disclosure was not made either to the company or the BSE. I note that the Noticee had not responded to the communications of SEBI addressed to it during the investigation, nor did it respond to any of the communications made during the present adjudication proceedings. Hence, the aforesaid facts of the breach of the acquisition limit by the Noticee, the non-disclosure of such acquisition to the company and the stock exchanges, stands established as uncontested. Therefore, I hold that the Noticee had failed to comply with Regulation 29(1) read with    Adjudication Order in respect of Modern Trading Business Private Ltd in the matter of The Byke Hospitlity Limited Page 8 of 10   Regulation 29(3) of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011. The said non-compliance makes the Noticee liable for monetary penalty under section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, the contents of which have already been reproduced above.  9. While determining the quantum of penalty under Sections 15A(b) of the SEBI Act as aforesaid, provisions of Section 15 J of SEBI Act would be applicable, which read as under:-   [Factors to be taken into account while adjudging quantum of penalty.] 15J. While adjudging quantum of penalty under [15-I or section 11 or section 11B, the Board or the adjudicating officer] shall have due regard to the following factors, namely :\\\\\\\\u2014 (a)the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default;  (b)the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default;  (c)the repetitive nature of the default.   [Explanation.\\\\\\\\u2014For  the  removal  of  doubts,  it  is  clarified  that  the  power [...] to  adjudge the  quantum  of  penalty  under  sections  15A  to  15E, clauses  (b)  and  (c)  of  section  15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.]  10. With regard to the above factors to be considered while determining the quantum of penalty, it is noted that the disproportionate gain made by the Noticee through such non-compliance, is not known. As regards the repetitive nature of the default, no prior non-compliance of the Noticee is available on record. It is noted that the Noticee has not responded to    Adjudication Order in respect of Modern Trading Business Private Ltd in the matter of The Byke Hospitlity Limited Page 9 of 10   communications from SEBI, which cannot be taken lightly as irreverence towards a statutory regulator and the regulatory process is prejudicial to the integrity of the securities market.    ORDER   11. After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, I impose a penalty of Rs. 3,00,000/- (Rupees Three Lacs only) under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act on Modern Trading Business Private Limited, which will be commensurate with its non-compliances.     12. The Noticee shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR through online payment facility available on the SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in on the following path, by clicking on the payment link.  ENFORCEMENT  Orders  Orders of AO  PAY NOW  13. The Noticee shall forward said Demand Draft or the details / confirmation of penalty so paid to the Enforcement Department \\\\\\\\u2013 Division of Regulatory Action \\\\\\\\u2013 I of SEBI.

R.K. Stockholding Pvt. Ltd.  (PAN:AACCR0011K)   In the matter of M/s. R.K.Stockholding Pvt. Ltd.   BACKGROUND OF THE CASE 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019), conducted a multi theme inspection of M/s. R.K. Stockholding Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred as \\\\\\\\u2018Noticee / RKSL\\\\\\\\u2019), during February 26 to March 01, 2018 and March 14-15, 2019 for the period from April 01, 2015 till December 31, 2017 (hereinafter referred as \\\\\\\\u2018inspection period\\\\\\\\u2019). During the inspection the Noticee viz. M/s. R.K.Stockholding Pvt. Ltd., was alleged to be in violation of various SEBI rules and regulations.  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 2. Vide communication order dated February 25, 2020, the undersigned has been appointed as Adjudicating Officer in the matter under Rule 4 of Securities Contracts (regulation) (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and imposing penalties) Rules, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCR Adj.

SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  3. A Show Cause Notice (SCN) dated July 29, 2020 was sent to the Noticee, receipt of the same was confirmed by the Noticee vide e-mail dated August 18, 2020. The Noticee vide email dated August 18, 2020, sought extension of time to submit its reply to the SCN. In the meantime, the Hearing Notice was digitally sent to the Noticee on September 24, 2020, giving opportunity of virtual hearing on October 15, 2020.Thereafter, the Noticee vide email dated September 30, 2020, submitted its detailed reply to the SCN. Submissions of the Noticee in a nutshell are mentioned below; \\\\\\\\u2022 With regard to the alleged observation in respect of Non- settlement of fund and securities of 180 active and 630 inactive clients amounting to Rs. 6,24,41,178 and Rs. 5,90,52,013 respectively, we would like to submit that due to some glitch in our back-office software, it didn\\\\\\\\u2019t settle the clients on the basis of last transaction date. We took up the matter with our software vendor for necessary rectification however that could not be incorporated hence we shifted the data to new software having required facility and thereafter all the cases are settled on time. During this shift of data some teething troubles were witnessed which we have overcome till an extend. We have always complied with all the regulations and when the glitch in software was noticed, we immediately took corretive action and ensured that all the regulatory requirements with respect to quarterly settlement are 100% complied with. \\\\\\\\u2022 Further, it is pertinent to mention that all the unsettle client during such quarter and observed by the SEBI have subsequently settled. \\\\\\\\u2022 With reference to the alleged observation in respect of pledging of 205 debit balance client\\\\\\\\u2019s securities were in excess of their obligation to the extent of Rs. 30.3 crores, we would like to mention that against the debit balance of Rs 3,58,91,006.44 due from 205 clients the overdraft was claimed of Rs. Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. R.K. Stockholding Pvt. Ltd.                               Page 3 of 23       11,18,15,163.42, therefore the excess pledging is of Rs 7,59,24,156.98 and not of Rs 30,29,60,145.94 as mentioned in the show cause notice. \\\\\\\\u2022 the excess pledging was of Rs. 7.59 crores instead of 30.3 crores and the securities were pledged against the outstanding receivable of Rs 3.59 crores from the clients. Further, it is pertinent to mention that out of excess value pledged of Rs. 7.59 crores, the value of Rs 5.84 crores pertains to our group companies (i.e. Rapid Credit & Holdings Pvt. Ltd., Invictus Stock Research Pvt. Ltd. and R. K. Commodities Services Pvt. Ltd.). So, the actual excess value of pledge is of Rs. 1.75 crores against Rs 30.80 crores as mentioned in show cause notice.  \\\\\\\\u2022 Further, we would like to mention that SEBI Inspection Team has been calculated the figure of overdraft claimed by assuming the hair cut of flat 50%. Whereas, the hair cut of 50% is not flat on every security as per our Lender (the haircuts are pre-defined by the institutions/bankers/funding house guidelines). Some securities have pre-defined hair-cut of even 60-75%. Once, we calculate on the actual approved hair- cut for the individual securities, the said excess pledged of Rs. 1.75 crores will not exist further. Also, we would like to add that our Lender (institutions/bankers/funding house) did their calculation on weekly basis i.e. every Saturday of prevailing week and take the Lowest price of Friday for their calculation i.e. 1st December, 2017. Whereas, the price mentioned by the inspection team was taken on the basis of closing rate of 08th December, 2017 which was a Friday, which itself makes difference of approximately 2-5% in price of majority of the scripts.Some Examples of majority of scripts are as follows: S. No.  Script name (A) Close price of 08.12.2017 which considered by Inspection team  (B) The low price of 01.12.2017 as per the file of Lender (which actually should be considered by inspection team)   (C) Qty of shares pledged (D) The amount difference (i.e. value of pledged securities considered by inspection team- Value of securities as per the file of the Lender) [(B*D)-(C*D)] 1. OMAXE Rs. 208.55 Rs. 207.60 1135800 Rs. 10,79,010 Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. R.K. Stockholding Pvt. Ltd.                               Page 4 of 23         \\\\\\\\u2022 The amount difference of above mentioned only 6 securities is around of Rs. 50 lacs, which itself witnessed that if we calculate the value of securities pledged with actual price considered by the lender (as per the file attached) for the individual securities, the said excess pledged of Rs. 1.75 crores will not exist further. The total overdraft utilized as on 08th December, 2017 was of Rs. 22.33 crores after considering the actual hair cut/value script wise. \\\\\\\\u2022 With reference to the alleged observation of pledging of credit/Nil balance clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities, first of all we would like to mention that the figure of Rs. 9.05 crores as alleged in show cause notice is the full value of securities pledged not the value of funds raised by pledging of credit/nil balance client\\\\\\\\u2019s securities. Whereas, the lending institutes provide the funds through pledging of client\\\\\\\\u2019s securities after the applicable hair cut only. So, if we even calculate the value of funds raised after assuming the flat 50% haircut (which is minimum) the actual fund raised by pledging of credit/Nil balance clients\\\\\\\\u2019 becomes the amount of Rs. 4.52 crores instead of 9.05 crores. \\\\\\\\u2022 Further, we agreed that as on 8th December, 2017, the client\\\\\\\\u2019s securities were pledged who have credit/Nil balance. however, the concerned clients were in regular habit of borrowing funds for the purpose of trading and investment in securities in the market. So, for convenience we have not got release of the pledged securities of the client for ease of the finance.

In view of above allegation of mis-utilisation of client\\\\\\\\u2019s fund is actually in-correct and contradict to the facts in records. Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. R.K. Stockholding Pvt. Ltd.                               Page 8 of 23       e. With reference to the alleged observation in respect of non- issuance of statement of pledging to clients, we would like to submit that we had no intention of not issuing these statements to the clients. As there was a change/shift in our back-office software and due to some teething troubles Initially, the statement of pledging was not being generated automatically through the software. We were in discussion with the empanelled vendor for the updation for so long and finally got it incorporated in the software. From June, 2018, the statement of pledging is being started to share with the clients regularly. f. With regard to the alleged observation in respect of misutilization of client\\\\\\\\u2019s securities to the extent of 82.11 crores as on December 08, 2017, at outset we would like to mention that the observation in respect of misutilization of client securities or Non-availability of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 securities is not correct on the ground that the securities received by us from the clients are sometimes required to be transferred to our clearing member i.e. ILFS for Margin requirements of the clients or at the time as per the client\\\\\\\\u2019s instructions the shares are transferred to NBFC i.e. Rapid Credit & Holdings Pvt. Ltd. (Rapid) for pledge on behalf of the client or to our group company i.e. R.K. Commodities Services Private Limited (RKCSPL) for Margin purpose, where the same client is registered to trade in commodity market through RKCSPL. g. However, for better improvement of records now we have made the adequate provision in ROS to show the trial of securities received from clients. So that, no such ambiguity arises on the comparison of only ROS with our Demat account. h. With regard to the alleged observation in respect of transfer of securities of worth Rs. 74.65 crores to related entities i.e. Rapid Credit & Holdings Pvt. Ltd. (Rapid), R. K. Commodities Services Pvt. Ltd. (RKCSPL) and  Invictus Stock Pvt. Ltd. (Invictus), at outset we would like to submit that the no securities were transferred by us to M/s Invictus Stock Research Pvt. Ltd. on further verification we found that certain securities were transferred by Rapid to Invictus for and on behalf of the clients against their inter-se fund raising arrangement between client and Rapid. Further, in respect of the transfer of securities to RKCSPL (R K Commodities Services P Ltd, this is commodity trading arm) , we state that the securities got transferred for the Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. R.K. Stockholding Pvt. Ltd.                               Page 9 of 23       collateral securities margin purpose for their trading with RKCSPL. With regard to transfer of securities with Rapid, we state that, Rapid is a NBFC company registered with RBI and few of our clients have entered into an agreement with Rapid for LAS facility. Therefore, as per the instruction of the clients, we had transferred the securities to Rapid on their behalf. i. It is pertinent to mention that there is always a time gap between the fund transferred for release of securities and actual release of securities by NBFC companies. And therefore, during the intervening period the funds of the clients remains blocked. j. Further, it is pertaining to mention that there is no mis-utilization of securities or balances at all. There were just the operational issues/mistakes, whereby the movement of the securities were improper, which was rectified subsequently.  k. We have transferred the securities on behalf of the clients directly to our group companies (i.e. Rapid and RKCSPL) but the funds didn\\\\\\\\u2019t come directly in our books of accounts it comes through the clients in there ledger (on whose behalf the securities have been transferred directly to group Company). As the securities were not mis-utilised and the entire stocks were always available at every point of time in an another demat accounts due to operational issues, very efficiently and effectively we have rectified the matter immediately i.e. only with in the spam of 3-4 months and as on 31st October, 2018 all the securities have been transferred back to R. K. Stockholding Pvt. Ltd. from its group companies. l. With regard to the alleged observation in respect of securities utilized of one client to meet another clients\\\\\\\\u2019 obligation to the value of Rs. 7.83 crores, at outset, we would like to mention that the system of maintaining ROS has not been properly explained by our staff to Inspection team mostly because of the nature of software used by us is quite complex. We clarify that some of the entries mentioned in Annexure- VI of Show Cause Notice is belong to suspense BO account that means it was the CS1 and GSA contra entries, So it was not the negative balance and further for other securities which were reflecting as a negative balance belong to the client of R. K. Stockholding Pvt. Ltd. have been received back from the clients in course of time as required. Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. R.K. Stockholding Pvt. Ltd.                               Page 10 of 23       m. So, there is no violation of utilization of securities of one client to meet another client\\\\\\\\u2019s obligation and all the rules and regulation have been complied with.  4. Subsequently, vide mail dated October 09, 2020, the Noticee confirmed its presence for the Virtual hearing scheduled on October 15, 2020. On the scheduled date of hearing, the hearing was attended by Authorized Representatives (ARs) of the Noticee, wherein the Noticee reiterated its submissions made vide its written reply dated September 30, 2020 and requested to substantiate its contentions with the support of additional documents, which was granted to the Noticee. Thereafter, vide e-mail dated November 10, 2020, the Noticee submitted its additional documents. ISSUES UNDER CONSIDERATION  5. I have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticees in the SCN and the material / documents available on record. In the instant matter, the following issues arise for consideration and determination:  I. Whether the Noticee has violated alleged SEBI rules, regulations and circulars?   II. Do the violations, if any, on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under section 23D of SCRA and 15HB of the SEBI Act?  III. If so, what would be the quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee after taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act?   FINDINGS 6. Before Proceeding further, the provisions as applicable, are reproduced as under:  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA (STOCK-BROKERS) REGULATIONS, 1992  Conditions of registration.   9. Any registration granted by the Board under regulation 6 shall be subject to the following conditions, namely,- (f) he shall at all times abide by the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II; Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. R.K. Stockholding Pvt. Ltd.                               Page 11 of 23          SCHEDULE II Securities and Exchange Board of India (Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992 CODE OF CONDUCT FOR STOCK BROKERS [Regulation 9]  A. (5) Compliance with statutory requirements: A stock-broker shall abide by all the provisions of the Act and the rules, regulations issued by the Government, the Board and the Stock Exchange from time to time as may be applicable to him.  Guidelines for execution of Power of Attorney by Clients favouring Stock Brokers / Stock Broker and Depository Participants Circular No. CIR/MRD/DMS/13/2010 dated April 23, 2010  PoA favouring Stock Brokers  PoA executed in favour of a Stock Broker by the client should be limited to the following:  1.ii. Pledge the securities in favour of Stock Broker for the limited purpose of meeting the margin requirements of the client(s) in connection with the trades executed by the clients on the stock exchange through the same Stock Broker. Necessary audit trail should be available with the Stock Broker for such transactions.  Enhanced Supervision of Stock Brokers/Depository Participants circular no. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated September 26, 2016  2.5. As per existing norms, a stock broker is entitled to have a lien on client's securities to the extent of the client's indebtedness to the stock broker and the stock broker may pledge those securities. This pledge can occur only with the explicit authorization of the client and the stock broker needs to maintain records of such authorization. Pledge of such securities is permitted, only if, the same is done through Depository system in compliance with Regulation 58 of the SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations,1996.  Issue No. I:  Whether the Noticee has violated alleged SEBI rules, regulations and circulars?  Running account Settlement  7. During the period of inspection, on perusal of the settlement report as on Dec 31, 2017, following was observed for the quarter Oct-Dec 2017: Sl No. Particulars  1. No of Active clients unsettled 180 Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. R.K. Stockholding Pvt. Ltd.                               Page 12 of 23       2. No of Inactive clients unsettled 630 3. Total amount i.e. Funds and Securities (after applicable haircut) unsettled \\\\\\\\u20b9 12, 14,93,191/- 4. Total amount i.e. Funds and Securities (after applicable haircut) of Active Clients unsettled \\\\\\\\u20b9 6,24,41,178/- 5. Total amount i.e. Funds and Securities (after applicable haircut) of Inactive Clients unsettled \\\\\\\\u20b9 5,90,52,013 /-  8. In this regard, it has been submitted by the Noticee that \\\\\\\\u201cdue to some glitch in our back-office software, it didn\\\\\\\\u2019t settle the clients on the basis of last transaction date. We took up the matter with our software vendor for necessary rectification.\\\\\\\\u201d In this regard, it is observed that back-office software issues are a matter of internal management of the Noticee, which should have been addressed on priority for immediate rectification of the same. Non-settlement of funds and securities of the clients is a gross violation and any violation in this regard cannot be done away with solely on the basis of software glitch in the back \\\\\\\\u2013 office of the Noticee. Thus, the contention of the Noticee is not tenable and seems to be an afterthought on part of the Noticee. 9. Also, non-settlement of running account of client has not been disputed by the Noticee. SEBI circular MIRSD/SE/Cir-19/2009 dated December 3, 2009 mandates that the actual settlement of funds and securities shall be done by the broker, at least once in a calendar quarter or month, depending on the preference of the client. Thus, it is established that the Noticee had violated provisions of the SEBI Circulars No. MIRSD/SE/Cir-19/2009 dated December 03, 2009. I note from the above that the Noticee did not comply with the aforesaid SEBI circular with respect to settlement of funds and securities of the clients and hence did not abide by the rules / Regulations made under the SEBI Act, thereby, failing to adhere to the Code of Conduct while conducting its business. Notice has thus violated clause A(5) of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 9(f) of the Stock Broker Regulations. 10. However, Noticee has further submitted that all the unsettle client during such quarter and observed by the SEBI have subsequently settled. To support its contention the Notice has submitted necessary documents for settlement done later in respect of top 100 Active and Inactive clients from the list of unsettled clients provided in the SCN, under current proceedings.

It is further observed that during the period of inspection, the details of client wise securities pledged by the Noticee as on Dec 08, 2017, were obtained and on verification of the trail balance, the following observations were made: Date Amount of funds raised against pledging of client securities (Rs.)

Funds raised by pledging securities of 214 debit balance clients as on Dec 08, 2017 was in excess of their obligation to the tune of Rs. 30.3 Crores.  b. Funds were raised by pledging securities worth of Rs. 9.05 crores of 830 clients with zero/ credit balance.  12. In this regard it has been submitted by the Noticee that \\\\\\\\u201cthe excess pledging was of Rs. 7.59 crores instead of 30.3 crores and the securities were pledged against the outstanding receivable of Rs 3.59 crores from the clients. Further, it is pertinent to mention that out of excess value pledged of Rs. 7.59 crores, the value of Rs 5.84 crores pertains to our group companies (i.e. Rapid Credit & Holdings Pvt. Ltd., Invictus Stock Research Pvt. Ltd. and R. K. Commodities Services Pvt. Ltd.).\\\\\\\\u201d  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..we agreed that as on 8th December, 2017, the client\\\\\\\\u2019s securities were pledged who have credit/Nil balance. however, the concerned clients were in regular habit of borrowing funds for the purpose of trading and investment in securities in the market. So, for convenience we have not got Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. R.K. Stockholding Pvt. Ltd.                               Page 14 of 23       release of the pledged securities of the client for ease of the finance. However, pertinently we have not used funds of the clients raised by those securities, we had surplus funds in our accounts\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..SEBI Inspection Team has been calculated the figure of overdraft claimed by assuming the hair cut of flat 50%. Whereas, the hair cut of 50% is not flat on every security as per our Lender (the haircuts are pre-defined by the institutions/bankers/funding house guidelines). Some securities have pre-defined hair-cut of even 60-75%. Once, we calculate on the actual approved hair- cut for the individual securities, the said excess pledged of Rs. 1.75 crores will not exist further\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d  13. In this regard, it is noted that SEBI inspection had considered the proportionate haircut of 50% based on the value of securities pledged and the amount of overdraft raised by the Noticee during the inspection period.  14. It has further been noted from the NSE inspection Committee report, wherein the inspection was conducted for the period mostly overlapping with Inspection carried out by SEBI and similar violations. The observations accorded in the report reads as \\\\\\\\u201con verification of the account scrip exposure statement provided by the Noticee, it has been observed that none of the securities were observed to be having haircut of more than 50%.\\\\\\\\u201d Thus, contention of the Noticee is not acceptable under current proceedings.   15. It is further observed that the Noticee had pledged client\\\\\\\\u2019s securities of those clients also, which had credit or nil balances as well as in excess of their debit obligations. This clearly shows that by pledging securities of such clients to raise funds, the Noticee has misused client\\\\\\\\u2019s securities as it has failed to demonstrate that funds amounting to 9.05 crores by pledging securities of 830 clients were used for meeting respective client\\\\\\\\u2019s obligation.

It was further observed that the Noticee had not issued pledge statements to respective clients whose securities have been pledged. In this regard, it is submitted by the Noticee that \\\\\\\\u201cwe had no intention of not issuing these statements to the clients. This happened due to change in our back \\\\\\\\u2013 office software\\\\\\\\u201d  17. It is observed that back-office software issues are a matter of internal management of the Noticee, which should have been addressed on priority for immediate rectification of the same. Therefore, any violation in this regard cannot be done away with solely on the basis of software glitch in the back \\\\\\\\u2013 office of the Noticee. Thus, the contention of the Noticee is not tenable and seems to be an afterthought on part of the Noticee.  18. However, it is observed that the Noticee, in it\\\\\\\\u2019s submissions has submitted that \\\\\\\\u201cthe statement of pledging is being started to share with the clients regularly.\\\\\\\\u201d In this regard Noticee has also submitted copy of sample pledge statements sent to the clients.   19. The above actions on part of the Noticee led to the violation of Clause 1(ii) as prescribed in Guidelines for execution of Power of Attorney by Clients favoring Stock Brokers / Stock Broker and Depository Participants of SEBI Circular CIR/MRD/DMS/13/2010 dated Apr 23, 2010, SEBI Circular CIR/MRD/DMS/13/2010 dated April 23, 2010, Clause 2.5 of SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2016/95 dated Sept 26, 2016 and SEBI Circular CIR/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2017/64 dated June 22, 2017.

The directions given in the ex parte order were issued during the pendency of the forensic audit of KSBL as ordered by NSE. Since, ex parte order was passed without hearing KSBL, therefore, ex parte order provided that KSBL can file its reply to the observations made in the ex parte order as well as avail opportunity of personal hearing if it so desires. I note that no reply to the ex parte order has been filed by KSBL till date. KSBL had indicated its willingness to avail opportunity of personal hearing, however, as narrated above, it did not avail such opportunity and sought adjournment hearing in the matter, as more specifically narrated in paras 7 to 25, above. In all the requests made for the adjournment of personal hearing, KSBL has sought adjournment on the ground that it had been making efforts to arrange funds to settle the claims of its clients. In the requests for adjournment, KSBL also informed that it has also been settling the claims of the clients by arranging funds from its different sources.Confirmatory order in the matter of Karvy Stock Broking Limited Page 15 of 16  29. I note that the directions issued against KSBL in the ex parte order are operating against it till date. It is further noted that trading terminals of KSBL were disabled by NSE, BSE and MSEI, with effect from December 02, 2019. Scope of the present proceedings is to confirm/revoke the directions issued vide ex parte order after hearing KSBL. Normally, the entity against whom an ex parte ad interim order is passed, files reply and try to seek expeditious hearing in the matter for revocation of ex parte ad interim order by bringing facts in support of vacation of ex parte ad interim order which has been passed pending investigation/inquiry/forensic audit. However, in the present case, KSBL neither filed any reply for revocation of ex parte order or not to confirm the ex parte order nor availed opportunity of hearing. On the contrary, on the eve of each date of hearing, KSBL sought adjournment, inter alia, on various pleas such as COVID-19 pandemic, heavy rains in Telangana, sickness of its Chairman, sickness of the buyer, etc. It is important to note here that in all the hearings granted on May 05, 2020 and afterwards, KSBL was given an option to avail virtual hearing through electronic audio-visual conference. I note that KSBL has not challenged transfer of securities made by NSDL from its demat account no. 11458979, to its 82559 fully paid clients, as referred to in para 5 above. I also note that in the various letters seeking adjournment, KSBL made submissions that it is transferring securities and funds to its clients. Such letters and conduct of KSBL shows that it admits the wrongdoing, as alleged in the ex parte order and therefore, has been taking the steps to remove the effects of its wrongdoing such as requesting more time so as to return the funds/securities to its clients whose securities were unauthorisedly pledged by KSBL. However, claims of many clients of KSBL still remains to be satisfied. Meanwhile, report of the forensic audit, which was directed to be conducted in the matter, has been received by SEBI from NSE and subsequent clarifications on the audit report have also been received on November 23, 2020. Thus, appropriate actions against KSBL and its directors, are to be initiated by SEBI for violation of the securities laws, as have been found in the forensic audit report and order dated November 23, 2020 of NSE.Confirmatory order in the matter of Karvy Stock Broking Limited Page 16 of 16  30. In view of the above, I deem it fit to proceed further in the facts and circumstances of the case and in exercise of powers conferred upon me under Sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 35 of SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008, hereby confirm the directions issued vide ex parte ad interim order dated November 22, 2019.  31. Transfer of funds/securities made by the KSBL to its clients subsequent to SEBI order dated November 22, 2019, would not absolve KSBL or its directors from violations of the provisions of the securities laws, as have been found in the forensic audit report received in the matter. It is clarified that confirmation of the directions issued in the ex parte order by the present order shall not in any way come in the way of transfer of the funds/securities, to be made by the KSBL to its clients. KSBL shall not alienate any of its assets, except with the prior permission of NSE till the settlement of claims of the investors or under direction or order by any Court or Tribunal.       32. Stock Exchanges and Depositories shall initiate appropriate action against KSBL and its directors, for the violations of their respective bye-laws, as have been found in the forensic audit report received in the matter, in accordance with law. NSE shall invite and deal with the claims of the clients of KSBL, in accordance with its bye-laws.

The amount of the fine was set in accordance with Paragraph 5, Article 171-1 of the \\\\\\\\u201cInsurance Act.\\\\\\\\u201d In addition, the FSC issued the company four official reprimands in accordance with Paragraph 1, Article 149 of the same Act. The details of the violations are as follows:\\\\\\\\n1. Where a single bank employee has handled policy loans and the purchases of new insurance policies, during the process of making the policy loans and underwriting the insurance policies, the insurer has simply believed the bank employee\\\\\\\\u2019s solicitation reports and the customer\\\\\\\\u2019s statements that deposits, salary, or bonuses were the sources of funds used for the transactions, and failed to discover through investigation that the customer had actually used the proceeds of policy loans to pay the premiums. On four separate occasions, the customer had used a policy loan to then purchase an investment-linked policy, but the insurer failed to confirm that the customer was aware of the related risks, failed to properly evaluate the customer\\\\\\\\u2019s needs or product suitability, and failed to properly require the solicitation channel and its employee to maintain legal compliance or establish related monitoring and control mechanisms.\\\\\\\\n2. In telemarketing products to persons with physical or mental disabilities, and in providing notifications of refusal to underwrite, where applicants had a Disabled Person Certificate or had a health problem (e.g. blindness in both eyes) that would qualify them to obtain a Disabled Person Certificate, the insurer has treated these facts as grounds for refusal to underwrite an application for products such as cancer insurance or life insurance, and failed to evaluate the possibility of using an alteration note to underwrite a policy while excluding certain types of coverage.\\\\\\\\n3. In exercising quality control on the solicitation practices of brokerage and agency channels, with respect to complaints that the sales agent who handled the signing of policy applications or that two or more sales agents jointly handled such signings, the insurer failed to clearly understand the appropriateness of the solicitation process or to carry out follow-up investigations. The insurer failed to properly look into complaints or carry out follow-up handling procedures. Also, the aforementioned solicitation disputes, poor management of solicitors, and poor legal compliance have not been factored by the insurer into its performance reviews.\\\\\\\\n4. In a number of areas, the insurer has shortcomings that could undermine the soundness of its business operations. Such problem areas include the following: the setting of insurance product commissions and bonuses; sales methods; solicitation and underwriting procedures for travel accident insurance; pre-launch product review mechanisms for investment-linked insurance policies, and post-sale periodic reviews of the investment instruments to which such policies are linked; and management of cybersecurity operations.\\\\\\\\nAs for Taiwan Cooperative Bank, the FSC imposed an administrative fine of NT$1.8 million in accordance with Subparagraph 2, Paragraph 1, Article 30-1 of the \\\\\\\\u201cFinancial Consumer Protection Act\\\\\\\\u201d due to the following shortcomings: consumers used the proceeds of policy loans to buy investment-linked insurance policies; the same person was allowed to handle the policy loan and sell the insurance; and the accurate information regarding the source of funds for premium payments was not provided in insurance solicitation reports.", "Date": "2020-11-24", "Regulatory": "FSC TW", "Title": "FSC imposes sanctions on BNP Paribas Cardif TCB Life Insurance and Taiwan Cooperative Bank", "URL": "https://www.fsc.gov.tw/en/home.jsp?id=54&parentpath=0,2&mcustomize=multimessage_view.jsp&dataserno=202101180004&dtable=News", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "Taiwan", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 57221, "unique_record_id": "ea86ef438aFSCTW20201124", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "66804c90785891030647118c", "parse_date": "2024-06-29 18:03:32", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Non-compliance", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "NT$3,000,000\nNT$1,800,000", "gpt_audience": "- Insurance regulatory authorities\n- Compliance officers in insurance companies\n- Legal advisors specializing in insurance law\n- Risk management professionals\n- Financial auditors\n- Insurance company executives\n- Consumer protection agencies\n- Policyholders and potential customers\n- Financial analysts and investors\n- Insurance brokers and agents", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "No individuals are mentioned.", "gpt_summary": "The FSC fined BNP Paribas Cardif TCB Life Insurance NT$3 million for improper management and issued four reprimands due to various violations, including failure to verify the source of funds for policy loans, improper handling of insurance applications for disabled persons, inadequate quality control in solicitation practices, and other operational shortcomings.

Power Bonds were found to have been issued to at least 830 investors (approx.) in the Financial Year 2007-08 to 2012-13 and thereby, illegally raising a sum of Rs. 98,78,000/- (approx.). Further, Infra Bonds were found to have been issued to at least 1359 investors (approx.) in the Financial Year 2017-08 to 2012-13 and thereby, illegally raising a sum of Rs. 1,58,27,000/- (approx.). The interim order found the Company had prima facie violated Regulations 4(2)(d), 5(2)(b), 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 19  and  26 of  the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018ILDS Regulations, 2008\\\\\\\\u2019) and Clause 2.1.1, 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 2.8, 4.1, 4.11, 4.14, 5.3.1, 5.3.3, 5.3.5, 5.3.6, 5.4, 5.6, 5.6A, 5.7.5, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, 5.12.1, 5.13, 6.0, 6.1 to 6.15, 6.16 to 6.34, 6.17.13, 41.6, 8.3, 8.8.1, 9, 10.1, 10.5  of  SEBI  (Disclosure and Investor Protection)  Guidelines,  2000 (since rescinded) (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cDIP Guidelines, 2000\\\\\\\\u201d), in  respect  of  the  allotments  made  before 06.06.2008 and Sections 56, 60, 73 of Companies Act, 1956. For the aforesaid violations, the interim order issued certain directions to the Company and its directors/ promoters, which are as under:  i. APL and its Directors/Promoters,  viz. Kali  Kishore  Bagchi; Kailash  Chand  Dujari; Nishant Prakash; Sudha Dujari; Mahammad Azam Khan; Bhasker  Shukla; Sasanka Roy Sarkar; Jamil Ahmed Farooqui; Syed Kazim Raza; Debdas  Chatterjee; Barun Kumar De; Bipradas  Majumdar and Ranjan Kumar Chowdhury, shall not access the securities market or  buy,  sell  or  otherwise  deal  in  the securities  market,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  or associate themselves with any listed company or company intending to raise money from the public; ii. APL and its Directors, viz. Kali Kishore Bagchi; Kailash Chand Dujari and Nishant Prakash shall neither dispose of, alienate or encumber any assets of APL bought from such funds;  iii. APL and its Directors/Promoters, viz. Kali  Kishore  Bagchi; Kailash  Chand  Dujari; Nishant  Prakash; Sudha  Dujari; Mahammad  Azam  Khan; Bhasker  Shukla; Sasanka  Roy Sarkar; Jamil Ahmed Farooqui; Syed Kazim Raza; Debdas Chatterjee; Barun Kumar De; Bipradas Majumdar and Ranjan Kumar Chowdhury, shall co-operate with SEBI and shall furnish all information/documents in connection with the offer and allotment of Deep Discount Bonds sought vide letters dated January 29, 2016.  2. The interim order also called upon APL and its abovementioned directors and promoter, to show cause as to why suitable directions/prohibitions under Sections 11, 11(4), and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 should not be issued/imposed, including the following directions, namely:Final Order in the matter of Amrit Projects Ltd. - Deep Discount Bonds Page 3 of 27  i. APL and its Directors, viz. Kali  Kishore  Bagchi; Kailash  Chand  Dujari and Nishant Prakash, to jointly and severally refund the money collected by the company through the offer  and  allotment  of Deep  Discount  Bonds,  with  an  interest  of  15%  per  annum  (the  interest being calculated from the date when the repayments became due in terms of Section 73(2) of the Companies Act, till the date of actual payment).  The refund of money should be supported by a Certificate of two independent Chartered Accountants to the satisfaction of SEBI; and ii. APL and its Directors, viz. Kali Kishore Bagchi; Kailash Chand Dujari; Nishant Prakash; Sudha Dujari; Mahammad Azam Khan; Bhasker  Shukla; Sasanka Roy Sarkar; Jamil Ahmed Farooqui; Syed Kazim Raza; Debdas  Chatterjee; Barun Kumar De; Bipradas  Majumdar and Ranjan Kumar Chowdhury to be restrained/prohibited from accessing the securities market  and  buying,  selling  or  otherwise  dealing  in  securities  in  any  manner  whatsoever, directly or indirectly, for  a period of  four years from the date of effecting the refund as directed above.  3. I note that the interim order also provided that in case APL and its directors/promoter fail to furnish their reply or seek an opportunity of personal hearing from SEBI, within a period of 90 days from the date of receipt of the interim order, the prima facie findings with respect to violation of public issue norms by the Company would become final and the directions contained in para 2 above, would become final and absolute against the Noticees to the interim order.   Replies, Personal hearing and Submissions:  4. I note that pursuant to the interim order, replies were received from Noticee no. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14, however, no replies were received from Noticee no. 6, 7 and 12. Further, no request for personal hearing was received from Noticee no. 6, 7 and 12. Hence, in terms of the interim order, no opportunity of personal hearing was granted to them and the directions contained in para 4.3 of the interim order (as reproduced in para 2 above) became final and absolute against Noticee no. 6, 7 and 12. Further, an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to Noticee no. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14 from whom replies were received. I note that the present proceedings are limited to the determination of liability qua Noticee no. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14 only.Final Order in the matter of Amrit Projects Ltd. - Deep Discount Bonds Page 4 of 27  5. The key contentions raised by Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14, vide their replies dated January 25, 2020, written submissions dated February 22, 2020 and at the time of personal hearing held on February 25, 2020, are as follows:  a) There has been an inordinate delay on part of SEBI in initiating the present proceedings. The SCN in no manner explains or provides any means for the said delay. It is important to consider that on account of such inordinate delay in issuance of SCN, we are not in a position to answer the present SCN. This delay has prejudiced our right to fair trial and the said delay is therefore in violation of basic principles of natural justice.  b) The present SCN merely refers and relies upon certain documents, however, none of the referred or relied upon documents is/are provided to us alongwith the SCN. In these circumstances, we were constrained to seek inspection and copies of all the documents referred and relied upon by SEBI in the present proceedings and therefore we had sought inspection of documents. It is submitted that we were not provided inspection of all documents relied upon by SEBI in the present SCN. c) Noticee no. 3 and 4 became directors in APL and proposed to set-up a Bio-Mass based renewable energy plant in West Bengal on turnkey basis. It is submitted that Noticee no. 3 came up with the technical knowledge and stated that Noticee no. 4 would assist in raising capital for the business. Accordingly, a project report was prepared during the FY 2002-03 and Noticee no. 3 along with Noticee no. 4 started collecting money for the project against Redeemable Preference Shares from the year 2004. It is pertinent to mention that the APL and/or Noticee no. 2 was never informed about the modalities, legalities, and issue of RPS as all the resolutions regarding the issue and approval of RPS were passed by Noticee no. 3 on various dates without informing APL and/or Noticee no. 2.  d) It is a fact that APL had decided to issue Deep Discount Bonds. However, the purpose of such issue was limited and restricted to the vendors of the power projects wherein the bonds were supposed to be only issued to the vendors for protecting their work orders for the power project and the bonds were never intended to be circulated to any general public or investors.Final Order in the matter of Amrit Projects Ltd. - Deep Discount Bonds Page 5 of 27  e) It is submitted that although it was decided, said decision was never implemented and no bonds were ever issued, since the vendors disagreed to accept the bonds. It is shocking to learn that the present SCN records that various investors have complained about issuance of such bonds and also have submitted such claims before SEBI. Therefore, it becomes evident that without the knowledge of APL and/or Noticee no. 2, the said bonds were issued by Noticee no. 3 and Noticee no. 4. f) It is submitted that SEBI has not carried out a detailed investigation in the matter before issuance of the present SCN and had proceeded to arrive at prima-facie findings against us, merely on the basis of certain complaints and alleged bonds purportedly provided by the complainants. With respect to the copies of four bonds provided by SEBI during inspection, it is submitted as under: i. APL has not issued these bonds ii. These bonds are not signed by Noticee no. 2. Signature of Noticee no. 2 is a digital encrypted signature and not an actual signature.  iii. The signature of the authorized signatory is not identifiable and is unknown. iv. That the funds mentioned in the bonds are not received by APL g) Noticee no. 14 had disassociated herself from the activities of APL since the year 1995. It is her case that she was/is a housewife and was never associated with the day to day activities of the management of the affairs of APL. It is submitted that it is a matter of record on SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s own showing in the SCN that the so called Deep Discount Bonds were allegedly issued by APL during the FY 2007-08 to 2012-13. Therefore, even assuming the said bonds were issued by APL, the same were admittedly not issued during my association with APL and therefore, SEBI ought not have passed any order or directions against me.   6. The key contentions raised by Noticee no. 3 to the allegations in the SCN, vide his reply dated June 26, 2018, reply on affidavit dated January 28, 2020 and at the time of personal hearing on January 30, 2020, are as follows:  a) Noticee no. 2 had approached him to join the company Amrit Bio Energy & India Ltd. for a special task i.e. for the development and building up of a green field power project in West Bengal and Assam for better industrial benefit.Final Order in the matter of Amrit Projects Ltd. - Deep Discount Bonds Page 6 of 27  Accordingly, Noticee no. 3 accepted the proposal of Noticee no. 2, and Noticee no. 3 was inducted as a director in the said company Amrit Bio Energy and Industries Ltd.  b) Noticee no. 2 later admitted Noticee no. 3 as a professional in APL on the post of Senior Executive purely on salary basis of Rs. 25,000/- per month for the purpose of developing the Green Field Power Project. c) Noticee no. 3 was not at all concerned with the day to day affairs of APL. The bonds or share documents issued by APL does not contain his name or signatures, nor he has signed any document or brochure. d) Noticee no. 3 has been deliberately misled  by Noticee no. 2 about the objectives and future functioning of APL. When Noticee no. 3 realised that his name has been fraudulently misused by Noticee no. 2, then he resigned in April 2013 from APL. e) Noticee no. 3 was also exonerated from action by the RoC Kolkatta in an earlier SCN issued against APL and its directors. f) The investors of APL had approached the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court Kolkatta and had filed a winding up petition bearing CP No. 220 of 2015 where the parties settled their disputes, hence the petition was dismissed as withdrawn. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court had observed in para 5 that \\\\\\\\u201cMr. Kailash Chand Dujari son of late Gokulchand Dujari, Chairman-cum-Managing Director of APL/ group of companies take the entire responsibility on behalf of the Amrit Projects/Amrit group of companies to make disbursement of payments in the manner specified in para 2 herein above\\\\\\\\u201d. In pursuance of this Settlement Order, Noticee no. 2 had issued a notification in the daily newspaper that APL intended to start the payment on and from the second week of Jan 2018 in a phased manner in terms of settlement CP No. 220 of 2015.  g) The bank accounts of Noticee no. 3 has already been freezed by the attachment order dated October 23, 2019 vide Attachment Certificate No. RC 2565 of 2019 by SEBI. So, Noticee no. 3 is suffering from extreme financial stringencies.  h) Noticee no. 3 is unable to furnish any details /documents regarding the offer and allotment of bonds, as sought by SEBI vide its letter dated January 29, 2018, as the present directors of APL and Noticee no. 2 are in full control of the details and documents of APL as sought by SEBI.Final Order in the matter of Amrit Projects Ltd. - Deep Discount Bonds Page 7 of 27  7. The key contentions raised by Noticee no. 4 to the allegations in the SCN, vide his reply dated June 22, 2018 and vide written submissions tendered at the time of hearing on December 30, 2019, are as follows: a) I was a salary paid director with APL for the period from January 10, 2007 to February 15, 2012. b) Preference shares (Deep Discount Bonds) were issued by APL before I joined APL. Form 23 uploaded by APL on MCA-21 portal in 2004 and 2006 may be seen.  c) I was not having much knowledge towards commercial aspects. I was assigned to APL\\\\\\\\u2019s administrative office work during the tenure of my service to the company. d) I had resigned from APL after a written assurance received from Noticee no. 2 and the other directors of APL for any liability that has been accrued or may accrue in future on APL will be taken care of by the then management.  e) I was assured remaining directors at the time of accepting my resignation that the dues of all creditors including financial and operational will be paid out of the surplus lying in the Balance Sheet dated March 31, 2012.  f) APL on my request had issued in press English and local language newspaper inviting objections if any from the public at large regarding my resignation so that their claim towards deposit could not be disturbed with my resignation and if they want to withdraw with my resignation, they can do so.  g) It is clear at the time of my resignation that most of the earlier deposits taken during the period 2007-2010 were of short term period were being matured and fully paid as the same was issued for tenure of 12-36 months.  The deposits taken in the last 24 months and are not matured at the time of my resignation only fallen in my tenure of directorship.  h) The unmatured deposits were been taken care of by the then management, it was assured to me by the then management for the repayment of every deposit holder and their amount was fully secured as APL was having sufficient assets to meet their liabilities.  i) The then management has also submitted by way of an affidavit taking all the responsibilities towards APL with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, New Delhi.  j) One petition was filed by the investors before the High Court at Kolkatta in C.P. No. 220 of 2015 and the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court by order dated July 13, 2016Final Order in the matter of Amrit Projects Ltd. - Deep Discount Bonds Page 8 of 27  accepted the submissions of the then management their responsibility on behalf of APL / group companies to make disbursement of payment in the manner specified in the said petition.   8. Noticee no. 5, 8 and 9 have raised similar contentions. The key contentions raised by Noticee no. 5, 8 and 9, to the allegations in the SCN, vide their separate replies dated June 10, 2018, vide their combined reply dated November 19, 2019 and vide combined written submissions tendered at the time of personal hearing held on December 30, 2019, are as follows:  a) We were unemployed and looking for business opportunities. We were looking for an investor who would invest in a piece of land that we later wish to develop. We got in touch with Noticee no. 2, 3 and 4 through one Mr. Amitava Banik. The said directors of APL initially showed interest in investing in the project but later they themselves lured three of us into working as employees for APL.  b) We were informed that APL had various projects in Steel, power, construction, cement, etc. and we would be working in the construction projects. We being unemployed, believed in the said representations of the directors. Thereafter, sometime in the beginning of year 2013, we were called by Mr. Banik and were made to sign several papers which he claimed to be mere formalities for completion of employment contracts.  c) We were later surprised to learn that we were made the directors of APL without our knowledge and consent. We immediately approached Mr. Banik and gave him an ultimatum if he did not remove our name as directors of APL, we shall lodge criminal complaint against him and other directors of APL.  d) We were made the directors of APL, just to have us implicated in the illegal activities of APL, as scapegoats. We were directors of APL for a very short span of time from February 4, 2013 to April 29, 2013. Hence, we are not involved in any transactions of APL.  9. The key contentions raised by Noticee no. 10 to the allegations in the SCN, vide his reply dated June 22, 2018, written submissions dated January 30, 2020 and at the time of personal hearing on January 30, 2020, are as follows:Final Order in the matter of Amrit Projects Ltd. - Deep Discount Bonds Page 9 of 27  a) I became the director of APL on the pursuance and insistence of Noticee no. 3. Noticee no. 3 had assured me that I need not do anything on behalf of APL and also need not undertake any financial obligation on behalf of APL.  b) I did not participate in any board meeting of APL during my tenure as director of APL. I was not involved in day to day business of APL. I did not participate in any policy making or decision making process of APL to mobilize funds from the public  c) I was appointed as director of APL on February 3, 2012 and resigned from directorship of APL on May 7, 2013. d) I had never received any monetary benefit from APL in any manner whatsoever at any point of time.   10. The key contentions raised by Noticee no. 11 to the allegations in the SCN, vide his reply dated August 1, 2018, written submissions dated January 8, 2020 and at the time of personal hearing on December 30, 2019, are as follows:  a) Sometime in 2012, Noticee no. 11 was requested by Noticee no. 2, the CMD of the company, namely Amrit Bio Energy Industries Ltd., to assist them to run an already built 10 MW bio-mass power plant situated in district of Bankura, West Bengal. b) In December 2013, Noticee no. 11 was informed by a staff of Noticee no. 2, to the fact that his name was featuring amongst the directors of the companies of Noticee no. 2, namely APL, Amrit Projects (N.E.) Ltd. and Amrit Bio Energy Industries Ltd., as non-executive director. Immediately, upon coming to know of such fraudulent act of Noticee no. 2 of making me director in the said companies without my consent, I immediately filed FORM DIR-11 with the RoC. I resigned from all the said companies in December 2013. c) The investors of APL had approached the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court Kolkatta and had filed a winding up petition bearing CP No. 220 of 2015 where the parties settled their disputes, hence the petition was dismissed as withdrawn. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court had observed in para 5 that \\\\\\\\u201cMr. Kailash Chand Dujari son of late Gokulchand Dujari, Chairman-cum-Managing Director of APL/ group of companies take the entire responsibility on behalf of the Amrit Projects/Amrit group of companies to make disbursement of payments in the manner specifiedFinal Order in the matter of Amrit Projects Ltd. - Deep Discount Bonds Page 10 of 27  in para 2 herein above\\\\\\\\u201d. In pursuance of this Settlement Order, Noticee no. 2 had issued a notification in the daily newspaper that APL intended to start the payment on and from the second week of Jan 2018 in a phased manner in terms of settlement CP No. 220 of 2015.  d) Noticee no. 11 has not received any money from APL. Noticee no. 11 and his wife are senior citizens and are surviving on the savings. The misconceived order of freezing the bank account and mutual funds vide Recovery Certificate No. RC2565 of 2019 and RC2566 of 2019, both dated October 23, 2019 have crippled us to the extent that it is making our survival at such fragile ages not only difficult, but impossible.   e) As per the provisions of Companies Act, 1956, the director of a company should have age between 25 and 70 years. However, the upper cap is not applicable if approval is obtained by special resolution in general meeting or approval is obtained from Govt. of India. I am not sure whether any such approval was obtained at the time of my appointment at 73 years of age as a non-executive director of APL. Hence, my appointment as director of APL is illegal.  11. The key contentions raised by Noticee no. 13 to the allegations in the SCN, vide his reply dated June 20, 2018, January 30, 2020 and submissions made by him at the time of personal hearing on January 30, 2020, are as follows:  a) Noticee no. 13 was an employee of APL. He was made the director of APL without any knowledge on his part by forging his signature. It was only when APL issued a letter of intimation to him on May 17, 2013, that he came to know that he was appointed as director of APL.  b) Noticee no. 13 resigned from APL on July 15, 2013 from the board of directors of APL and APL also filed Form DIR-12 to RoC accordingly.  c) Noticee no. 13 neither attended any board meeting of APL, nor put his signature on any Share Certificates issued by APL or even was authorised signatory on behalf of APL. d) Noticee no. 13 had no knowledge about the management of APL relating to issuance of shares, bonds, Deep Discount Bonds etc. and all being done by Noticee no. 2. Hence, Noticee no. 13 will not be in a position to comply with theFinal Order in the matter of Amrit Projects Ltd. - Deep Discount Bonds Page 11 of 27  direction in the interim order relating to provision of information about APL and its Deep Discount Bonds issue.  e) In similar circumstances, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in Appeal No. 346 of 2016, decided on July 25, 2017, has already absolved Noticee no. 13 from the proceedings of the order passed by SEBI in redeemable preference shares issue by APL.  Consideration of issues and findings thereon:  12. I have perused the allegations made in the SCN and submissions made in the replies, written submissions and during the personal hearings by the Noticees. Before dealing with various contentions raised by the Noticees regarding merits of the case, it would be appropriate to deal with preliminary objections raised by some of them.  13. Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14 have raised a preliminary objection to the issuance of SCN in the present matter. It is the case of the said Noticees that the inordinate delay in the issuance of SCN in the present matter has prejudicially affected their rights to put forward an effective defence and thus has resulted in violation of the principles of natural justice. I note that Noticee no. 1 raised the money from public through issue of Deep Discount Bonds without following public issue norms like issue of prospectus, registration of prospectus, etc. Thus, the issue of Deep Discount Bonds was made in the clandestine manner. As soon as SEBI received complaints in the matter, it started examination and collecting of information from the Company, investors, RoC, etc. On preliminary examination, it was noted that the Company had issued Deep Discount Bonds to 2200 investors during FYs 2007-08 to 2012-13. SEBI had to examine as to how many issues were made by APL and whether each issue was in compliance with law or not. For each such issue information was required to collected from APL, investors, etc. I note that the number of complaints started increasing after SEBI had passed final order in the matter of Redeemable Preference Shares issue by APL in February 2016. I note that during examination, SEBI had sent letters of enquiry, seeking various details from APL and Noticee no. 2, however, despite successful delivery of SEBI letters, Noticee no. 1 and 2 failed to reply/respond to the said letters. I also note that a physical verification of the Registered Office Address of APL which was carried out by SEBI in August 2017, revealed that APL was not traceable at the Registered Office Address. Thus, the primary and direct sources of obtainingFinal Order in the matter of Amrit Projects Ltd. - Deep Discount Bonds Page 12 of 27  information with regards to the Deep Discount Bonds i.e. APL and its Managing Director, were not co-operating with SEBI. Hence, the information with regard to the issue was collated and compiled from indirect source i.e. the investors. Data from 2200 investors was collated and compiled to arrive at the minimum no. of Deep Discount Bonds issued by APL across the FY 2007-08 to 2012-13.  When the data in respect of Deep Discount Bonds that were issued was compiled, and no signs of co-operation were visible from Noticee no. 1 and 2, an ex-parte interim order cum show cause notice came to be passed and issued by SEBI in June 2018. In view of the above, I note that there has been no unexplained delay in the issuance of the SCN in the present matter.  I further note that Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14 have been provided with the inspection and copies of all the documents that have been relied upon in the SCN. Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14 have filed their detailed replies and written submission, raising all possible contentions in their defence. I also note that Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14 have not specifically pointed out any document which they could not retrieve due to alleged delay in initiation of proceedings which has impacted their defence  in  the  present  proceedings  or  has  rendered  the  same ineffective.  Hence, I do not find merit in the contention of the Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14, that efflux of time has affected their ability to retrieve evidence to defend themselves.  14. I note that Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14 had raised another preliminary objection at the time of personal hearing held on February 25, 2020 that they have not been provided with the complete inspection of all the documents relied upon by SEBI in the interim order cum SCN, namely, copy of all complaints received by SEBI and copy of all bond certificates as provided by the complainants. Taking note of the aforesaid submission by the counsel representing Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14, it was directed to provide inspection of all complaints that were received by SEBI in this matter and the bonds that were provided by the complainants. Post inspection, Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14 were also given opportunity to file additional reply/ written submission, in 10 days. I note that, as directed in the personal hearing, the counsel for Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14 were provided on March 3, 2020, with copies of and inspection of all complaints that were received by SEBI and relied upon by the SCN in this matter and copies and inspection of the bonds that were provided by the complainants. Thus, I find that the contention raised by Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14, at the time of personal hearing on February 25,Final Order in the matter of Amrit Projects Ltd. - Deep Discount Bonds Page 13 of 27  2020, with regard to the inspection of documents, no more survives. I also note that, vide email dated May 1, 2020, the counsel for Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14 had sought additional time to file his additional submissions post-inspection of documents, on the ground that there was a lockdown imposed in Kolkatta and his clients were unable to access the records of APL. SEBI had vide email dated July 10, 2020, communicated to the counsel representing Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14, to file his additional reply/ written submissions on or before July 20, 2020, failing which the matter would be proceeded on the basis of material available on record. A reply was received from the counsel for Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14, expressing his inability to furnish additional submissions before July 20, 2020, because his clients were senior citizens and based in Kolkatta where the pandemic was at its peak. He emphasized on the administrative difficulties faced by his clients since the company staff was not available for work and it was difficult to verify the company records with the documents provided during inspection. I note that it has been over three months since the last request for extension of time to file written submissions was made by the counsel for Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14, however, till the date of this order, no such submissions have been filed by him. Hence, I shall now proceed to examine the case on the basis of merits, qua Noticee no. 1, 2 and 14, on the basis of material available on record.   15. Noticee no. 1 and 2 have contended that APL and its Chairman and Managing Director i.e. Noticee no. 2 were absolutely unaware of any Deep Discount Bonds being issued in the name of APL. According to them, APL has not issued any such Deep Discount Bonds to the investors. It is their case that though at one point of time it was decided to issue Deep Discount Bonds, but such decision was never implemented. I do not find merit in the aforesaid contention of Noticee no. 1 and 2 for the following reasons:  a) From the extract of the minutes of the Extra Ordinary General Meeting held on February 14, 2008 (as available in FORM 23 filed at MCA 21 Portal), the following resolution is seen to have been passed at the extra ordinary general meeting of APL:  \\\\\\\\u201cRESOLVED THAT pursuant to section 293(1)(d) of Companies Act, 1956, and all other enabling provisions, if any, the consent of the Company, be and is hereby accorded to the Board of Directors of the Company for issuing bonds in the nature of deep discount bonds to the tune of Rs. 50 crores (Fifty Crores)\\\\\\\\u201dFinal Order in the matter of Amrit Projects Ltd. - Deep Discount Bonds Page 14 of 27   I note that the extract of minutes of meeting of EGM held on February 14, 2008, makes it amply clear that APL had resolved in the said EGM to issue Deep Discount Bonds and it is also clear that Noticee no. 2 was aware of this decision, since the extract of the minutes of said EGM, as uploaded on MCA 21 Portal, was signed by Noticee no. 2 himself, as the Chairman of APL. I also note that the Explanatory Statement appearing as part of this extract of minutes of meeting did not mention anything about the issue of Deep Discount Bonds being limited to the vendors of the proposed power project, as contended by the Noticee no. 1 and 2. Thus, the claim of Noticee no. 1 and 2 that they were completely unaware of the issue of Deep Discount Bonds by APL is untenable.   b) For the sake of argument, even if it is assumed that Noticee no. 1 and 2 were completely unaware of such Deep Discount Bond issues and they came to know about it for the first time through the SEBI letters of enquiry which were  issued by SEBI to them in January and March 2016, but even after such knowledge, the said Noticees did n", "Date": "2020-11-24", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Final Order in the matter of Amrit Projects Ltd. - Deep Discount Bonds)", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/nov-2020/final-order-in-the-matter-of-amrit-projects-ltd-deep-discount-bonds-_48252.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 57219, "unique_record_id": "10ec154c0cSEBI20201124", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "66804c587858910306471188", "parse_date": "2024-06-29 18:02:33", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Non-compliance", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "Rs. 98,78,000\nRs. 1,58,27,000", "gpt_audience": "- Investors of Amrit Projects Ltd.\n- Directors and Promoters of Amrit Projects Ltd.\n- Legal and Compliance Teams\n- Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\n- Chartered Accountants and Auditors\n- Financial Analysts and Advisors\n- Regulatory Authorities\n- Legal Counsel representing the Noticees\n- General Public interested in securities market regulations\n- Shareholders of Amrit Projects Ltd.", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

From the table above, it was observed that the Noticee  along with 33 entities traded among themselves and contributed Rs. 776.25 (633 trades) to the market +ve LTP, which is 10.58% of the market +ve LTP.   13. Entities at Sr. No. 1 to 33 (sellers) namely Mindex Capital Market Private Limited (Formerly known as MKN Equity Brokers Pvt. Ltd.), JMS, KKSL, Nishant, Centillion, S K HUF, Famous, SSCSL, Economy, Embassy, Accolade, Golden, Parnami, Ashu, Parveen, PFIPL, Rolex, M K N Commodity, Nitin HUF, K K HUF, Mudit HUF, M K HUF, Sanjay, Raghav, Seabird Retails, Seabird Vincon, Seabird Distributors, Savita, Santosh, Shivdarshan, Laxmi, Dilip, and Noticee, were alleged to have aided Noticee and other 10 connected entities (buyers) namely Nishant, Vimgi, Famous, Economy, Embassy, Rolex, Seabird Retails, Seabird Vincon, Seabird Distributors and Shivdarshan, by selling shares to increase the price of the scrip.   14. Also, 11 connected entities (buyers) namely Nishant, Vimgi, Famous, Economy, Embassy, Radhu (Noticee), Rolex, Seabird Retails, Seabird Vincon, Seabird Distributors and Shivdarshan, having net +ve LTP contribution, contributed Rs. 2632.50 (34.03% of the market +ve LTP) to the market +ve LTP.  15. In view of the significant +ve LTP contribution by the entities by trading among themselves it was alleged that the Noticee along with the aforesaid 33 entities i.e. Mindex Capital Market Private Limited (Formerly known as MKN Equity Brokers Pvt. Ltd.), JMS, KKSL, Nishant, Centillion, S K HUF, Famous, SSCSL, Economy, Embassy, Accolade, Golden, Parnami, Ashu, Parveen, PFIPL, Rolex, M K N Commodity, Nitin HUF, K K HUF, Mudit HUF, M K HUF, Sanjay, Raghav, Seabird Retails, Seabird Vincon, Seabird Distributors, Savita, Santosh, Shivdarshan, Laxmi, Dilip and Vimgi,  created misleading appearance of trading and manipulated the price of the scrip by contributing to the price rise and hence violated Section 12 A(a),(b),(c) of SEBI Act, 1992 r/w RegulationAdjudication Order in respect of Radhu Developers Pvt Ltd in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 8 of 22   3(a),(b),(c),(d) and Regulation 4(1), 4(2) (a), (e) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003.   16. The aforesaid alleged violations, if established, make the Noticee liable for monetary penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act.  17. The SCN was served to the Noticees by email on July 21, 2020. Vide letter dated September 12, 2020, Noticee filed its reply.  18. The key submissions of the Noticee are reproduced as below:  a) Noticee is a private limited company which is involved in trading and investment of shares, jobbing, arbitrage etc. since its incorporation 15 years back (26/08/2005). At present a number of trained (some certified) professionals are employed in the company for doing such works in a number of scrips in BSE or NSE on a daily basis. b) Noticee has an unblemished record of 15 long years in the market and has never been found committing any offence related to securities markets. The Directors of the Noticee also boast of similar reputation. c) The impugned trades are 6 years old and as such it is difficult for the Noticee to trace and collate relevant information or documents pertaining to such period. d) Noticee traded in the PMC scrip in usual course of its business. Before commencement of Patch 3 period the Noticee had 60,700 shares of PMC in its portfolio at an average price of Rs.555.11/-. On February 7, 2013 the shares of PMC were split from Rs.10/- to Rs.5/-. Such corporate action of PMC ensured that the Noticee's shares in PMC double in number and consequently the average purchase price was halved. At the commencement of Patch 3 the answering Noticee had 1,21,400 shares of PMC @ Rs.277.55/-. The aforesaid shares of PMC were purchased by the Noticee in usual course of its business based on in-house understanding of the mood of the market. It may be noted that even the SCN does not impugn any trade of the Noticee in PMCAdjudication Order in respect of Radhu Developers Pvt Ltd in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 9 of 22   executed prior to Patch 3 (whether during or before the investigation period). e) Noticee predominantly sold PMC scrips during Patch 3 (90,532 shares) and booked profit in asmuch as due to the split of shares the Noticee had in excess of 1.2 lakh shares of scrip in its portfolio at a very reasonable average price. Moreover the price of the scrip was increasing. The Noticee found it prudent to book profit and exit the stock. It was more so when the stock was generally illiquid. f) During this period (Patch 3) the Noticee in usual course of business purchased only 2002 shares of PMC on March 5, 2014 and March 7, 2014. 2 shares were bought on 5 th March, 2014 while the rest were purchased on March 7, 2014. Patch 3 covers 357 days. On no other occasion during Patch 3 the Noticee purchased PMC shares. Hence, such purchase was random, insignificantly low in terms of volume and incidental, if not accidental. g) Noticee neither manipulated the price of PMC upwards nor had the intention to do so. The conduct/behavior of the Noticee was all along visibly bona fide, rational and natural. h) Whatever manipulation of price or projection of non-genuine/artificial volume qua the PMC scrip may have been alleged against the Noticee in the SCN is \"multilateral\" in nature. There is no charge of 'unilateral' price manipulation leveled against the Noticee. Admittedly, the Noticee is not alleged to have advanced the bid of the PMC scrip. i) The phrase \"during patch 3, 34 entities trading amongst themselves created misleading appearance of trading and manipulated the price of the scrip by contributing to the price rise\" is quoted in support of the above contention. j) In such event, establishing a collusion or nexus between the Noticee and its respective counterparties in respect of the impugned trades becomes a sine qua non to prove the charge of manipulation. k) In Vikas Ganeshmal Bengani Vs. Whole Time Member, SEBI (Appeal No. 225/2009 judgment dated 25-02.2010) the Hon'ble SecuritiesAdjudication Order in respect of Radhu Developers Pvt Ltd in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 10 of 22   Appellate Tribunal (SAT) held that- \"It is, thus clear, that in order to establish the charge of price manipulation collusion between the buyer and the seller is necessary. In the case before us it has not been alleged that the appellant was colluding with the counterparty (seller) or with his broker. In absence of such allegation it cannot be held that the appellant was manipulating the price of the scrip of the company upwards.\\\\\\\\u201d l) Recently, in M/S Nishith M. Shah HUF vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 97/2019 judgment dated 16.01-2020) the Hon'ble SAT held that- \\\\\\\\u201cIn Jagruti Securities Limited vs Securities and Exchange Board of India (Appeal No. 102 of 2006 decided on October 27, 2008) and in Vikas Ganeshmal Bengani vs Whole Time Member, SEBI (Appeal No. 225 of 2009 decided on February 25, 2010) the Tribunal held that the charge of raising price artificially has to be established and the element of collusion between the buyer and the seller is a sine quo non. We are in the entire agreement with the aforesaid decisions and reiterate that in the absence of any finding of collusion between the buyer and the seller the charge contributing to the LTP cannot be sustained.\\\\\\\\u201d m) It is submitted that there is absolutely no connection between the Noticee and any of the counterparties (or their brokers) qua the impugned trades as allegedly identified by SEBI. The Chart contained in paragraph 14 of the SCN lists 92 entities allegedly based on the criterion of 5%+ LTP (Last Traded Price) contribution to the market LTP. n) Noticee has been named in Sl. No. 23 of the Chart. The only noticee allegedly connected to the Noticee is the entity (S.S. Corporate Securities Limited), which is a registered stock broker. Assuming (without admitting) the said noticees are connected, the alleged connection is of no consequence. o) It is not the case of SEBI that the S.S. Corporate Securities Limited was the counterparty or counterparty broker in any of the impugned trades involving the  Noticee. p) It is worth mentioning at this juncture that the broker of the Noticee namely Bhaijee Portfolio Limited in respect of all traded executed duringAdjudication Order in respect of Radhu Developers Pvt Ltd in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 11 of 22   Patch 3 is not a noticee or a connected party. The said broker is also not in the Top 10 buying or selling broker list. q) The Chart contained in paragraph 44 of the SCN, where trading amongst 34 entities during Patch 3 is said to have been analyzed, does not disclose a single trade between the S.S. Corporate Securities Limited and the Noticee. The rest of the entities are admittedly not connected to the Noticee. r) Insofar as the counterparties in respect of the impugned trades are concerned, it is submitted that SEBI in its SCN has not been able to demonstrate any connection between the said counterparties (or their brokers) and the Noticee. In fact, SEBI has not even alleged in the SCN that any such counterparty is in any manner connected to the Noticee. s) It is strenuously submitted that in the electronic, faceless and anonymous online trading system of the stock exchange approved by SEBI the Noticee had no means to know the counterparty. t) It is also a fact and SEBI does not allege either that the Noticee has any nexus with PMC or its promoters or directors or KMPs etc. u) SEBI in the Chart contained in paragraph 39 of the SCN alleges that as per its \"Buy LTP Analysis\" during Patch 3 period 11 entities, including the Noticee, contributed to \\\\\\\\u2018net +ve LTP\\\\\\\\u2019 to the PMC scrip. It is alleged that the Noticee contributed to net +ve LTP of Rs. 9.75/- which accounts for an insignificant 0.20% of total market +ve LTP. v) Out of 12 buy trades executed by the Noticee during Patch 3 only 2 trades of 2 shares of PMC both executed on March 5, 2014 have been alleged to have contributed to +ve LTP impact of Rs. 15.75/-. It appears from the trading analysis chart (paragraph 44) that out of these 2 trades 1 was executed with Embassy Sales Private Ltd and the counterparty in the other trade is a non-noticee. It is not even alleged in the SCN that the Embassy Sales Private Ltd and Noticee are connected entities. w) It is therefore evident that during Patch 3 the Noticee executed only 1 such trade with one of the fellow 33 entities and that too of 1 share where the Noticee placed a buy order slightly above the LTP. It is submittedAdjudication Order in respect of Radhu Developers Pvt Ltd in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 12 of 22   that a single trade of 1 share above/below LTP is incapable of either creating any artificial volume qua any scrip or causing unnatural price rise/fall of a scrip. x) SEBI, therefore, fails to establish that during the Patch 3 period the Noticee has, by trading with the other 33 entities, created any artificial volume in the PMC scrip or caused/contributed to price rise in the scrip. y) The word \\\\\\\\u2018manipulation\\\\\\\\u2019 has not been defined in the either SEBI Act or PFUTP Regulations. Daniel R. Fischel and David J. Ross in an article named \"Should the Law Prohibit 'Manipulation' In Financial Markets?\" published in Harvard Law Review (1991) said/opined that in respect of financial market a conduct is manipulative if it is designed to do any one of the following three: i. Interfere with the free play of supply and demand. OR ii. Induce people to trade. OR iii. Force a securities price to an artificial level. z) It is an established principle of law that merely because some random buy orders may have been placed at prices higher than the LTP in the scrip would not lead to the inference that the price was being manipulated upwards. aa) Similarly, merely because some random sale orders may have been placed at prices lower than the LTP in the scrip would not lead to the inference that the price was being manipulated downwards. bb) Every trade would impact the LTP either way unless it has been executed at the same price at which the scrip was traded the last time (i.e. LTP=0). cc) Unless there is an identifiable pattern of trading in a particular scrip to either inflate or depress the price thereof and there are repetitive trades in the scrip over a period of time in accordance with such design or pattern or in a particular direction it cannot be concluded/inferred that relevant trades are manipulative or meant to be manipulative. dd) In the case of Kavita Jain & Ors. in the matter of trading activities of certain entities in the scrip of Viji Finance Limited (Decided on: 28th May, 2020) it has been held that:Adjudication Order in respect of Radhu Developers Pvt Ltd in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 13 of 22   \"While the common email ID does establish a connection between the two Noticees, a case of fraudulent trading, misleading appearance of trading and manipulative price rise cannot rest on LTP increase by just a single trade of 10 shares during a one month period when a total 16,701 shares were traded. While this single trade caused an increase in LTP of RS. 4.35, it is important to remember that all trades have an impact on price either upwards or downwards, except those that happen exactly at the same price as the last trade. To conclude that trading was manipulative, there needs to be a pattern of causing such increase or decrease repetitively over a period of time. A single trade out of 217 cannot be said to be fraudulent or manipulative and cannot be said to have caused an artificial price rise, particularly when there are several other trades with a larger LTP difference during the same period. I also note that on the very same day as the impugned trades, i.e. April 04, 2014, after a short while, the price fell to Rs. 21.6, a LTP fall of Rs. 4.90, before rising again to Rs. 26.5 i.e. an LTP rise of Rs. 4.90.\" ee) As per SEBI's alleged Buy LTP Analysis of Patch 3 period itself, the number of buy trades and the number of shares thus traded (bought) having +ve LTP impact on the PMC scrip are 2 each (i.e. 2 trades of 1 share each). Both these trades took place on March 5, 2014. Admittedly, neither of these trades created any new high price. The NHP analysis contained in the SCN does not indict the Noticee. ff) Admittedly, no other purchase of PMC scrip by the Noticee during Patch 3 is alleged to have contributed to +ve LTP. As per the Buy LTP Analysis contained in paragraph 39 of SCN, out of the balance 10 trades the Noticee's buy orders were either equal to (on 9 occasions) or below (1 occasion) LTP and they together resulted in -ve LTP impact of Rs.6/-. gg) During Patch 3 the Noticee sold 90,532 shares of PMC and booked profit inasmuch as the price of the scrip was increasing. Such decision of the Noticee or its management was prudent and rational. hh) The Patch 3 period covers almost a full year (20.03.2013-12.03.2014). Out of the 357 days of Patch 3, the Noticee bought the scrip in questionAdjudication Order in respect of Radhu Developers Pvt Ltd in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 14 of 22   only on 2 days i.e. March 5, 2014 and March 7, 2014. The March 7 purchases by the Noticee have not been alleged to be +ve LTP contributors by SEBI. ii) It is submitted that during the entire patch covering 357 days only 2 trades of 2 shares executed in a single day cannot be said to indicate any pattern of trading. It is more so when the counterparty in one of them is not a noticee. jj) What remains is a single buy trade of 1 share with a Embassy Sales Private Ltd Rs.3 above the LTP. This single trade (impugned) is random. It might have been an operational error or an act of inadvertence or a short-lived error of judgment which was immediately rectified. This single impugned trade signifies nothing. kk) There must be an identifiable pattern of trading in a particular scrip to either inflate or depress the price thereof and there must also be repetitive trades in the scrip over a period of time in accordance with such design or pattern. Otherwise, it cannot be concluded/inferred that relevant trades are manipulative. ll) One/two odd buy order(s) placed above LTP cannot be said to be fraudulent or manipulative and cannot be said to have caused artificial price rise. 2 trades of 1 shares each out of 100s of trades executed by the Noticee on one particular day out of 357 days in the concerned patch is too miniscule and too insignificant to create any misleading appearance of trading and/or manipulative price rise. mm) It is repeated and reiterated that in order to establish a charge of price manipulation collusion between the parties i.e. the buyer and the seller must be established. There is nothing in the SCN to suggest that there is any connection between the Noticee and any of its counterparties in any of the impugned trades executed during the Patch 3 period. Hence no inference of price manipulation can be drawn in the present case.Adjudication Order in respect of Radhu Developers Pvt Ltd in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 15 of 22   nn) Insofar as the Chart in paragraph 44 of the SCN (i.e. trading amongst 34 entities during Patch 3) is concerned, 3 trades where the Noticee is the seller have been referred to. oo) The allegation is that of contributing to market +ve LTP to the tune of Rs.13. It has been alleged that noticees namely Vimgi Investment Private Limited, Famous Investments Consultants Private Limited and Seabird Retails Private Limited were the buyers in such trades. A trade where the Noticee bought 1 share of the scrip from Embassy Sales Private Limited on March 5, 2014 has also been listed in paragraph 44. pp) The SCN fails to demonstrate any connection between the Noticee and Embassy Sales Private Ltd and/or Seabird Retails Private Ltd and/or Famous Investment Consultants and/or Vimgi Investment Private Ltd. qq) Thus in view of the fact that no connection has been shown between the Noticee and its counterparties in the impugned trade and in further view of the facts that the impugned trades are too rare and insignificant in number and volume, the allegations of manipulating the scrip price of PMC, causing misleading appearance of trading in the said scrip or contributing to price rise thereof during Patch 3, as leveled by SEBI against the Noticee cannot be sustained. rr) In the facts and circumstances stated hereinabove it is submitted that in the matter of PMC the Noticee did not use or employ any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of SEBI Act or any other provision of law or the Rules and Regulations framed thereunder while transacting (selling and/or purchasing) in the said (PMC) scrip. ss) It is denied that the Noticee while dealing in the PMC scrip employed any device, scheme or artifice to defraud any person/entity. tt) It is further denied that the Noticee while dealing in the PMC scrip engaged in any act, practice, course of business which might operate as fraud or deceit upon any person and/or in contravention of SEBI Act or any other provision of law or the Rules and Regulations framed thereunder.Adjudication Order in respect of Radhu Developers Pvt Ltd in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited  Page 16 of 22   uu) The Noticee did not, at any point in time, including in the Patch 3 period, deal with the PMC scrip in a fraudulent manner [within the meaning of 'fraud' as defined inter alia in Regulation 2(1)(c) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003]. vv) The Noticee did not indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair", "Date": "2020-11-24", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Adjudication Order in respect of Radhu Developers Private Limited in the matter of PMC Fincorp Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/nov-2020/adjudication-order-in-respect-of-radhu-developers-private-limited-in-the-matter-of-pmc-fincorp-limited_48256.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 57207, "unique_record_id": "566f546438SEBI20201124", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "66804b637858910306471178", "parse_date": "2024-06-29 17:58:26", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "No financial penalties mentioned.", "gpt_audience": "1.

Order pattern and matching of orders at Table above is explained as follows:- (a) Sr. No.1:Vide order ID 14000252053272, Noticee 1 placed buy order at Rs. 198.30 for 1 share at 10:19:46 despite sell order ID13000200000144 being available at lower price i.e. at Rs. 198.00 and higher quantity i.e. 8 shares at 10:17:22. The buy and sell order matched at Rs. 198.00 and LTP of Rs.15.95 was established.   Adjudication Order in respect of Nirshilp Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shailesh Shah Securities Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Super Sales India Ltd.  Page 12 of 43  (b) Sr. No. 2:Vide order ID 18000129025390, Noticee 1 placed buy order at 09:28:12 for 1 share at price Rs. 190.10 while sell order ID 22000101023829 was available at Rs. 204.00 for 5 shares at 09:50:17, Noticee 1 updated buy order price to Rs. 204.25 at 10:20:47 without change in quantity. The buy and sell order matched at Rs. 204.00 and LTP of Rs. 13.95 was established.   (c) Sr. No. 3: Vide order ID 11000061007894, Noticee 1 placed buy order at 09:21:58for 1 share at price Rs. 204.10 and updated the price without change in quantity despite sell order ID14000091008667 being available at Rs. 238 for 25 shares at 09:27:40, Noticee 1 updated the buy order to Rs. 238.30 for 1 share at 09:28:11. The matching of orders contributed to LTP of Rs. 13.00. (d) Sr. No. 4: Vide order ID21000084004616, Noticee 1 placed buy order at 09:23:34for 1 share at price Rs. 218.05 and updated the price to Rs. 239.25 at 09:26:49 despite sell order ID20000093019224 being available at Rs. 239.00 for 200 shares at 09:26:23. The matching orders contributed to LTP of Rs. 11.95.  (e) Sr. No. 5: Vide order ID14000252053335, Noticee 1 placed buy order at 10:19:52 for 1 share at price Rs. 190.15 and updated the price to Rs. 199.15 at 10:45:29 despite sell order ID 21000195064704 being available at Rs. 199.00 for 15 shares at 10:42:14. The matching orders contributed to LTP of Rs. 8.45.    23. From the above analysis, it was observed that Noticee 1 repeatedly placed buy orders above prevailing sell order rates after the sell orders are available in the system with negligible buy quantity. A genuine buyer would not repeatedly place buy orders at a price higher than the sell order price and for a quantity lesser than the available sell order quantity. Thus, it was alleged that Nirshilp repeatedly placed the aforesaid orders with a manipulative intent to increase the price of the scrip.   Adjudication Order in respect of Nirshilp Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shailesh Shah Securities Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Super Sales India Ltd.  Page 13 of 43  (ii) LTP contributed by repeatedly matching sell orders placed above LTP through market orders with negligible buy quantity 24. Out of 520 positive LTP trades, Noticee 1 placed market buy order (a market order is a buy or sell order to be executed immediately at current market price) in 91 trades for 191 shares. Such trades contributed Rs. 215.80 (5.09% of total market positive LTP). Market orders of Noticee 1 that contributed the highest LTP were further analysed and few instances of the pattern are as follows:-  Sr. No. Date Order Type Order No Order Time (LM) Order Qty (LM) Order Price (LM) Trade time Trade Qty.

(e) Sr.No.5: Vide order ID14000297163157at 15:29:32, Noticee 1 placed buy order at market price for 2 shares despite sell order ID 20000253315671 for 15shares at 15:22:03 being available. The matching orders contributed to LTP of Rs. 4.00.   26. Thus, it was alleged that the above trading pattern of Noticee 1 of matching market orders with negligible buy quantity was with an intent to deliberately increase the scrip price and hence, manipulative in nature.  (iii) LTP contributed by repeatedly executing self-trades   27.

The order pattern was examined as follows:-  (a) Sr.no.1: Vide order ID13000142006289 at10:15:05, Noticee 1 placed buy order at Rs.205.65 for 1 share to match its own order ID 15000143000093 for 1 share placed at 10:11:49. The matching orders contributed to LTP of Rs.19.55. (b) Sr.no.2: Vide order ID12000148060390 at13:24:44, Noticee 1 placed buy order at market price for 1 share to match its own order ID 11000125295286 for 1 share placed at 13:21:29. The matching orders contributed to LTP of Rs. 17.20. (c) Sr.no.3: Vide order ID20000097024247 at 10:05:05, Noticee 1 placed buy order at Rs. 200.95 for 1 share to match its own order ID 11000075009796 for 1 share placed at 10:02:48.

The matching orders contributed to LTP of Rs. 14.60.  31. The above order pattern of self-trades by Noticee 1 allegedly demonstrated its manipulative intent to inflate the scrip price. Noticee 1 executed a total of 153 self-trades for 156 shares on 90 trading days during Patch 1. Hence, it was alleged that the self-trades of Noticee 1 which contributed towards 8.76% of total market positive LTP and being repetitive in nature, were with an intent to increase the price of the scrip. Thus Noticee 1 acted in a manner which led to a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip and manipulated the price of the scrip without any intention of change in ownership of the security.   Adjudication Order in respect of Nirshilp Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shailesh Shah Securities Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Super Sales India Ltd.  Page 17 of 43   32. Noticee 1 thus was alleged to have manipulated the price of the scrip in violation of Section 12A (a), (b) and (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 r/w Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d), 4 (1), 4 (2) (a), (e) and (g) of PFUTP Regulations.   33. It was also observed that 61 self-trades for 61 shares by Noticee 1 were executed from the same terminal ID and the broker for these trades on buy and sell side was Noticee 2, Shailesh Shah Securities Pvt. Ltd.  (\\\\\\\\u201cShailesh\\\\\\\\u201d). Noticee 2 thus acted as buy and sell broker of Noticee 1 in self-trades. It was observed from the MCA data that Noticee 1 and Noticee 2 have common registered address i.e. Office No.141, Centre Point Somnath Daman- 396210, and email ID as sandeep.bhanushali@dolatcapital.com. Further, Jigar Pankaj Shah was the common Managing Director of both entities during the investigation period. Hence, it was alleged that Noticee 2 facilitated the manipulative self-trades of its client Noticee 1 during the investigation period leading to creation of misleading appearance of trading in the scrip and manipulation of the price of the scrip without any intention of change in ownership of the security. Thus, it was alleged that Noticee 2 violated Section 12A (a), (b) and (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 r/w Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d), 4 (1), 4 (2) (a), (e) and (g) of PFUTP Regulations. Further,  by doing so, Noticee 2 was alleged to have failed to exercise due skill and care in terms of Clause A(2) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified under Schedule II read with Regulation 7 of SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992.  34. In view of the above, the Noticees were called upon to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against them in terms of Rule 4 of the SEBI (Procedure for holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules 1995 read with Section 15 I of the SEBI Act and why penalty should not be imposed under Section 15HA and Section 15HB of the SEBI Act, as applicable, for the aforesaid alleged violations.   Adjudication Order in respect of Nirshilp Securities Pvt. Ltd. and Shailesh Shah Securities Pvt. Ltd. in the matter of Super Sales India Ltd.  Page 18 of 43  35. The SCN was served upon both the Noticees vide e-mail dated May 18, 2020. The Noticees were granted a period of 14 days from the date of receipt of notice by them, to submit a reply to the SCN, if any.   36. Since no reply was received from the Noticees within the stipulated period, a Hearing Notice dated October 21, 2020 was served upon the Noticees through e-mail, granting an opportunity of hearing by videoconferencing through WebEx on November 12, 2020, and granting an extended opportunity to file a reply to the SCN by November 5, 2020.   37. Noticees 1 and 2 replied to the SCN vide letter dated November 2, 2020 submitted through e-mails dated November 3, 2020, making the following identical submissions:- (a) Noticee is not connected to the Bharat Patel group and therefore has no comments to offer in respect of statements made in the SCN pertaining to the said Group.  (b) Assuming without admitting that Noticee contributed to the positive LTP, Noticee denied that it knowingly and with manipulative intent contributed towards the alleged contribution to the LTP. (c) No adverse inference may be drawn against Noticee in view of the fact that Noticee was amongst top 10 net positive LTP contributors as buyers. (d) Some of the sell orders were placed before Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s buy orders at higher price and for the remaining trades, the sell orders were placed after the buy orders in normal course of business pursuant to Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s clients trading strategies which is a permissible practice.

The action has been filed in New York to recover the amount due to the QFCRA from assets held by FAB in New York. FAB has failed to make payment against this final judgment rendered by the Civil and Commercial Court (QFC Court) in the Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) thereby requiring the QFCRA to take steps to enforce the court\\\\\\\\u2019s judgment under well-recognised measures for international enforcement of money judgments.  The action arises from FAB\\\\\\\\u2019s obstruction of an investigation conducted by the QFCRA and the lack of integrity demonstrated by FAB in its conduct as a firm conducting business in the QFC. In March 2018, the QFCRA formally appointed investigators to conduct an investigation into suspected market misconduct by FAB of the Qatari Riyal, Qatari Government securities and related financial instruments.  FAB applied for, and was granted authorisation, to operate through a branch in the QFC and, as a condition of that authorisation, FAB is required to comply with all QFC rules and regulations, including its obligation to cooperate with investigations by the QFCRA into alleged misconduct. As part of its investigation, the QFCRA required FAB to provide copies of the relevant trading records (and related documents).   FAB failed to produce the required information and failed to provide confirmation that it would preserve and not destroy the relevant documents. As a result of FAB\\\\\\\\u2019s failure to provide the relevant records, the QFCRA initiated proceedings in the QFC Court to require FAB to comply with the QFCRA\\\\\\\\u2019s request. Over FAB\\\\\\\\u2019s opposition, the QFC Court ordered FAB to provide the requested documents.  FAB appealed that decision but the appeal was dismissed on 13 May 2019, and the court order requiring FAB to produce the relevant documents became final.   FAB still refused to comply, thereby violating the court order and obstructing the QFCRA\\\\\\\\u2019s investigation. FAB also refused to provide the confirmation to preserve and not destroy the documents it was ordered to produce.  On 17 September 2019, FAB was held in contempt of court. Following the dismissal of its appeal, FAB stated that it was withdrawing from the QFC and closing its QFC branch. This unilateral statement of its withdrawal was an attempt to avoid accountability for its actions and to continue its obstruction of the QFCRA\\\\\\\\u2019s investigation.  FAB, however, failed to take the legal steps necessary to affect a withdrawal from the QFC and, as such, its status remains unchanged and it remains subject to compliance with the QFC\\\\\\\\u2019s rules and regulations. The ability to investigate alleged wrongdoing by authorised firms in the QFC is essential to maintaining the financial integrity of the QFC and to ensure that all users of the QFC have confidence in the integrity of the firms that have chosen to be authorised in the QFC.   FAB\\\\\\\\u2019s deliberate obstruction and refusal to comply with its legal and regulatory requirements presented a significant threat to the QFC, as a financial centre. As a result of FAB\\\\\\\\u2019s obstruction of the QFCRA\\\\\\\\u2019s investigation, the QFCRA imposed a financial penalty of QAR 200,000,000 on FAB on 21 August 2019. The financial penalty reflected the gravity and seriousness of the breaches of regulatory requirements by FAB, which deliberately obstructed the QFCRA\\\\\\\\u2019s investigation and had a harmful impact on the QFC. Following application by the QFCRA and in accordance with the QFC\\\\\\\\u2019s regulations, the QFC Court ruled that the assessment of QAR 200,000,000 was to be converted into an ordinary judgment debt payable to, and recoverable by, the QFCRA.  FAB has failed to make the required debt payment despite its legal obligation to do so.  The QFCRA\\\\\\\\u2019s action demonstrates that the QFCRA will not hesitate to take all measures necessary to protect the integrity and reputation of the QFC as a leading financial and business centre and to remedy all harms to the QFC caused by unethical conduct.

OFFICER) RULES, 1995. ______________________________________________________________________________ In respect of:   M/s Harishankar Paper Products (P) Ltd.   (PA No. AAACH4932K) Plot no. 345, Sai Krupa Market,  Mehboob Mansion, Malakpet,  Hyderabad - 500036.  In the matter of Cosboard Industries Ltd.   1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as 'SEBI') conducted an examination in the scrip of Cosboard Industries Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as 'the target company'), a company listed on the BSE Limited (hereinafter referred to as 'BSE') during the quarter ended December 2016. During the course of such examination, SEBI observed that a promoter of the target company, namely, M/s Harishankar Paper Products (P) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019) had pledged its shares during the quarter ended December 2016. In this regard, NSDL vide email dated July 18, 2017 provided demat account statement of the promoters with respect to pledging of shares of the target company. It is observed from the statement that shares were pledged by the Noticee during the aforesaid period. The details of the same are as under:  Sr. No. Name of the promoter No. of shares held in December 2016 qtr. No. of shares pledged during December 2016 qtr.  Date of Pledge Mode of Pledge 1 Noticee  1,95,950 1,95,950 25-10-2016 Demat  2. In view of creation of pledge of shares as aforesaid, the Noticee was required to make the requisite disclosures to both the target company and every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed i.e. BSE under Regulation 31 (1) read with Regulation 31 (3) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 (hereinafter referred to 'SAST Regulations').______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Harishankar Paper Products (P) Ltd. in the matter of Cosboard Page 2 of 7  3. However, it is observed that in response to SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s query, BSE vide e-mail dated November 14, 2019 had submitted its reply that BSE has not received any disclosures from the promoter of the target company in terms of SAST Regulations for the aforesaid transactions i.e. with respect to creation of pledge of shares as aforesaid.    4. Further, the Noticee was asked by SEBI to inform about any disclosures made to BSE and the target company towards the creation of pledge. In this regard, it was observed that the Noticee vide letter dated September 23, 2019, informed SEBI that it had made disclosures to the company but was unaware of requirement of submission of disclosures to Stock Exchange.  5. After examining the information available on record, it is alleged that the Noticee has not made the requisite disclosures to BSE under Regulation 31 (1) read with Regulation 31 (3) of SAST Regulations. The said provisions of SAST Regulations read as under: SAST Regulations Disclosure of encumbered shares. 31. (1) The promoter of every target company shall disclose details of shares in such target company encumbered by him or by persons acting in concert with him in such form as may be specified. (2) \\\\\\\\u2026.. (3) The disclosures required under sub-regulation (1) and sub-regulation (2) shall be made within seven working days from the creation or invocation or release of encumbrance, as the case may be to,\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) every stock exchange where the shares of the target company are listed; and (b) the target company at its registered office.   6. Vide a communication-order dated January 22, 2020, it has been informed that the competent authority in SEBI is satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to inquire into the affairs and adjudicate upon the alleged violation by the Noticee as aforesaid. It has also been informed that competent authority has appointed the undersigned as Adjudicating Officer Section 15-I of SEBI Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as 'SEBI Act') and Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and imposing penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Adjudication Rules') to inquire into and adjudge the aforesaid alleged violation by the Noticee under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act.   7. Accordingly, after receipt of records of these proceedings, a notice to show cause no. EAD/AP-SKS/OW/4227/4/2020 dated January 30, 2020 (\\\\\\\\u2018the SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee in terms of Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules read with section 15I of the SEBI Act calling upon it to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against it in terms of rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules and penalty be not imposed under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act for the aforesaid alleged______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Harishankar Paper Products (P) Ltd. in the matter of Cosboard Page 3 of 7  violation. The SCN was sent at the last known address of the Noticee through Speed Post with Acknowledgment Due and the same was duly served. In the said SCN, the Noticee was asked to reply within a period of 14 days, however, no reply was received from the Noticee.   8. From the letter dated September 23, 2019, through which the Noticee had informed SEBI that it had made disclosures to the company but was unaware of requirement of submission of disclosures to Stock Exchange, I note that that the Noticee had provided its email id viz.  harishankar_paper@yahoo.com. Thereafter, in the interest of natural justice and in terms of rule 4(3) of the Adjudication Rules, additional opportunity to file reply to the SCN was granted to the Noticee and an opportunity of personal hearing was granted on August 24, 2020. The same was communicated to the aforesaid e-mail id of the Noticee vide e-mail dated August 14, 2020. The said notice was digitally signed in term of the requirement prescribed under rule 7 (b) of the Adjudication Rules. The second proviso to rule 7 (b) specifies that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026a notice sent through electronic mail shall be digitally signed by the competent authority and bouncing of the electronic mail shall not constitute valid service;\\\\\\\\u201d. The Notice sent vide e-mail dated August 14, 2020 was duly served in compliance with the said requirements under rule 7 (b) and proof of delivery report is on record. However, no reply / communication has been received from the Noticee despite service of notice upon it. In the interest of principles of natural justice, the Noticee was given another opportunity to file reply to the SCN and was also granted an opportunity of personal hearing on September 16, 2020 and the same was communicated to the aforesaid e-mail id of the Noticee vide e-mail dated September 09, 2020. However, no reply / communication has been received from the Noticee despite service of notice upon it. Vide the said SCN/notice of hearing, it was clearly indicated that in case of failure to submit reply or to appear for the hearing, the case would be proceeded with ex-parte on the basis of the material available on record. It is noted that the Noticee had neither filed any reply nor have availed the opportunities of personal hearing despite service of notices upon it. In the facts and circumstances of this case, I am of the view that the Noticee has nothing to submit and in terms of rule 4(7) of the Adjudication Rules the matter can be proceeded ex-parte on the basis of material available on record.  9. I have carefully considered the allegations and charges levelled against the Noticee and relevant material relied upon in this case. In absence of any response from the Noticee, it is presumed that the Noticee admitted the charge of provisions as alleged in the SCN. In this regard, the observations of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (\\\\\\\\u2018SAT\\\\\\\\u2019) in the matter of Classic Credit Ltd. vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 68 of 2003 decided on December 08, 2006) are relevant to rely upon wherein it has that- \"\\\\\\\\u2026 the appellants did not file any reply to the second show-cause notice. This being so, it has to be presumed that the charges alleged against them in the show cause notice were admitted by them\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Others vs SEBI (Appeal No. 68 of 2013 decided on February 11,______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Harishankar Paper Products (P) Ltd. in the matter of Cosboard Page 4 of 7  2014), has, inter alia, observed that: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted charges levelled against them in the show cause notices...\\\\\\\\u201d   10. While deciding the case, I cannot lose sight of settled position of law that the charge should be established with valid reasons and in accordance with law. I, therefore, deem it necessary to examine the charge. It is a case where the charges and allegations have been leveled based upon the information provided by NSDL, BSE and that of the Noticee. The supporting material was provided to the Noticee along with the SCN. I have, therefore, considered the allegation leveled in the SCN and the relevant material brought on record.   11. The allegation is that the Noticee had failed to make disclosure to the stock exchanges i.e. BSE and CSE as mandated under Regulation 31(1) read with 31(3) of the SAST Regulations as it being a promoter of the target company had pledged 1,95,950 shares of the target company on October 25, 2016. I note that the Noticee being a promoter of the target company had pledged 1,95,950 shares of the target company on October 25, 2016, and hence, it was under obligation to make requisite disclosures to the stock exchanges i.e. BSE and the target company under Regulation 31(1) read with 31(3) of the SAST Regulations within seven working days from the date of creation of pledge i.e. October 25, 2016. While disclosures were made by the Noticee to the target company, it had failed to make requisite disclosures to the Stock exchange i.e. BSE. The Stock exchange i.e. BSE vide e-mail dated November 14, 2019 had submitted its reply that it has not received any disclosures from the Noticee in terms of SAST Regulations for the aforesaid transactions i.e. with respect to creation of pledge of shares as aforesaid. Further, the Noticee vide letter dated September 23, 2019, had informed SEBI that it had made disclosures to the company but was unaware of requirement of submission of disclosures to Stock Exchange. Thus, it is established that the Noticee had failed to make disclosure to the stock exchange i.e. BSE as mandated under Regulation 31(1) read with 31(3) of the SAST Regulations.   12. Thus, the failure of the Noticee, who is a promoter of the target company, as found in this case shows defiance of binding obligations cast upon it under the SAST Regulations. Therefore, in my view, the failure of the Noticee as found in this case deserves imposition of monetary penalty under section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act. The provisions of 15A (b) of the SEBI Act read as under:  Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc.      15A. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder,- (a) \\\\\\\\u2026.. (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Harishankar Paper Products (P) Ltd. in the matter of Cosboard Page 5 of 7  regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees;  13. The intention of the SAST Regulations is to cover all types of encumbrances by whatever name called. The Noticee, being a promoter, has to understand the nature of encumbrance and that those encumbrances which entail a risk of the shares held by promoter being appropriated or sold by a third party, directly or indirectly, are required to be disclosed to the stock exchanges in terms of the SAST Regulations. All stakeholders, including minority shareholders should be aware of the detailed reasons for pledging of shares by the promoters, particularly for situations where promoters are holding a significant stake and have pledged their shares. In case of defaults, the shares of promoters can be invoked and sold by the lenders in large quantities which may lead to distress sale and fall in prices, affecting other investors, including minority shareholders. Further, the provisions of regulations of the SAST Regulations are meant to ensure timely disclosures of significant change in shareholding as such disclosures also enable the stock exchanges and regulators to monitor such material event. Such disclosures also bring about transparency and enable the investors in the scrip to take an informed investment or disinvestment decision. All stakeholders, including minority shareholders should be aware of the change in shareholding of the promoters. Any information asymmetry with regard to such transactions as in this case would defeat the purpose of disclosures. Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (\\\\\\\\u2018SAT\\\\\\\\u2019) in the matter of Coimbatore Flavors & Fragrances Ltd. vs SEBI (Appeal No. 209 of 2014 order dated August 11, 2014), has also held that \\\\\\\\u201cUndoubtedly, the purpose of these disclosures is to bring about more transparency in the affairs of the companies. True and timely disclosures by a company or its promoters are very essential from two angles. Firstly; investors can take a more informed decision to invest or not to invest in particular scrip secondly; the Regulator can properly monitor the transactions in the capital market to effectively regulate the same.\" Further in the matter of Appeal No. 66 of 2003 - Milan Mahendra Securities Pvt. Ltd. vs. SEBI \\\\\\\\u2013 the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, vide its order dated April 15, 2005 held that, \\\\\\\\u201cthe purpose of these disclosures is to bring about transparency in the transactions and assist the Regulator to effectively monitor the transactions in the market.\\\\\\\\u201d  14. For the purpose of adjudication of penalty, it is relevant to mention that under section 15I of the SEBI Act imposition of penalty is linked to the subjective satisfaction of the Adjudicating Officer. The words in the section that \"he may impose such penalty\" are of considerable significance, especially in view of the guidelines provided by the legislature in section 15J. The factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act are as follows:-  \\\\\\\\u201c15J \\\\\\\\u2010 Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15\\\\\\\\u2010I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:\\\\\\\\u2010______________________________________________________________________________________ Adjudication Order in respect of Harishankar Paper Products (P) Ltd. in the matter of Cosboard Page 6 of 7  (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investor/s as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default. Explanation- For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E,clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.\\\\\\\\u201d  15. Having regard to the factors listed in section 15J and the guidelines issued by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in SEBI Vs Bhavesh Pabari Civil Appeal No(S).11311 of 2013 vide judgement dated February 28, 2019, it is noted that from the material available on record, any quantifiable gain or unfair advantage accrued to the Noticee or the extent of loss suffered by the investors as a result of the default in this case cannot be computed. Further, the material brought on record shows that the failure of making requisite disclosures under SAST Regulations by the Noticee was on one occasion and hence, it cannot be said to be repetitive in nature. I also observe that the violation pertains to a period which is more than four years old and the Noticee had made requisite disclosures under SAST Regulations about its pledge transaction in question to the company, which is a mitigating factor. However, I am of the view that non-adherence to the laid down obligations under the SAST Regulations by the Noticee as observed in this case would compromise the regulatory framework and should be dealt with by imposing monetary penalty.   16. Taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case including the aforesaid 15J factors and exercising the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby impose a monetary penalty of \\\\\\\\u20b9 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh Only) on the Noticee under section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act. In my view, the said penalty is commensurate with the violation committed by the Noticee in this case.  17. The Noticee shall remit / pay the said total amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order in either of the way of demand draft in favour  of  \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties  Remittable  to  Government  of  India\\\\\\\\u201d,  payable  at Mumbai, or by following the path at SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in, ENFORCEMENT > Orders > Orders of AO > PAY NOW; OR by using the web link https://siportal.sebi.gov.in/intermediary/AOPaymentGateway.html. In case of any difficulties in payment of penalties, the Noticee may contact the support at portalhelp@sebi.gov.in  18. The Demand Draft or details and confirmation of e-payment made in the format as given in table below should be sent to \"The Division Chief, EFD-DRA-III, Securities and Exchange Board of India, SEBI Bhavan, Plot no.

Sekar Vasu ADRPV2013N (The aforesaid entities are hereinafter referred to individually by their respective names/serial numbers or collectively as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticees\\\\\\\\u201d)  In the matter of Pine Animation Ltd.,  BACKGROUND  1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (herein after referred to as \"SEBI\"), conducted an investigation into the dealing/trading in the scrip of Pine Animation Limited (formerly known as Four K Animation Limited) (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPAL\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cthe Company\\\\\\\\u201d), during the period from March 28, 2013 to January 30, 2015, since sharp rise in traded volume and price of the scrip of PAL was observed during the said period.  2. The shares of the Company were listed on the BSE Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBSE\\\\\\\\u201d) from March 25, 1994 onwards. The shares of the Company were suspended from trading for the period from November 09, 1998 to June 22, 2012. Pursuant to the revocation of suspension, the trading in the scrip of the Company resumed only on March 28, 2013, when a Special Pre-open Session was conducted in the scrip. On March 28, 2013, the opening trade in the shares of PAL was executed at \\\\\\\\u20b9441/-. Subsequently, the price of the shares of PAL rose to \\\\\\\\u20b9485/- on April 02, 2013. Adjudication Order in respect of 5 entities in the matter of Pine Animation Ltd.,              Page 2 of 12   3. On May 17, 2013, the shares of PAL were split from the face value of \\\\\\\\u20b910 each to \\\\\\\\u20b91 each. Thereafter, the price of the scrip touched a high of \\\\\\\\u20b9100.60 (split adjusted price) on June 20, 2013 (i.e price of the scrip without split rose upto \\\\\\\\u20b91006.00 per share with a face value of \\\\\\\\u20b910). The price of the shares of the Company rose from \\\\\\\\u20b9441 to \\\\\\\\u20b91,006 (Split adjusted price \\\\\\\\u20b9100.6) in a span of less than 3 months, despite the fact that the shares of the Company were suspended from trading on the exchange platform for around 14 years and the Company had neither any history of profit in previous financial years nor the Company made any material corporate announcements pertaining to its business affairs. It was noticed that after July 2014, the price of the scrip of the Company started falling.   4. It was observed that the Company had made the two preferential issues (first on December 13, 2012 and second on March 15, 2013) for a total number of 2,47,000 shares at a price of \\\\\\\\u20b910 per share, just before trading resumed in the scrip on the stock exchange on March 28, 2013. The investigation found that few preferential allottees who are found to have close nexus with the Company and its Promoters/Directors, and have allegedly played a role in the fraudulent and manipulative scheme, since the allotment of shares on preferential basis to them were funded by PAL itself. These preferential allottees also benefited from the scheme by selling the shares allotted to them at artificially inflated price. The investigation inter-alia found that Unique Image Production Pvt., Ltd., (Noticee 1) and First Entertainment Pvt., Ltd., (Noticee 2) were the Promoters of PAL while the Noticees 3, 4, and 5 viz., Murali Shanmugam, Prabu Sekar and Sekar Vasu respectively are the Directors of the said Promoter companies, i.e., Noticees 1 and 2. The investigation revealed that the Noticees 1 and 2 have transferred their entire shareholding in PAL to six entities, who in turn have facilitated further off-market transfers of the physical shares received by them from the Promoters of PAL to 49 other entities. These 49 entities spread across different parts of the country are found to have sold those shares at an artificially inflated price. In view of the above, it has been alleged that the Noticees 1 to 5 Adjudication Order in respect of 5 entities in the matter of Pine Animation Ltd.,              Page 3 of 12   were participants in the fraudulent scheme/device that was orchestrated for manipulating the price of scrip of PAL for the benefit of these off-market recipients of the shares of the Company. Accordingly, it has been alleged that the Noticees have violated the provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3(a), (b), (c) and (d) and 4(1) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018PFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019) by being a part of manipulative scheme described above. APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  5. Pursuant to investigation, SEBI initiated Adjudication Proceedings against the Noticees and appointed the undersigned as the Adjudicating Officer, vide order dated September 1, 2017, under Section 19 of the SEBI Act read with Section15-I of the SEBI Act 1992 and Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge under Section 15 HA of the SEBI Act 1992, for the violations alleged to have been committed by the Noticees.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  6. A common Show Cause Notice (SCN) ref. no. EAD-6/ADJ/PM/AA/OW/19655/2018 dated July 11, 2018 was served upon the Noticees under Rule 4 of SEBI Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry be not held against them in terms of Rule 4 of the SEBI Adjudication Rules and penalty be not imposed under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992, for the violations alleged to have been committed by them.  7. The Noticees vide a common reply dated July 23, 2018 made their submissions to the charges alleged in the SCN, which are summarized hereunder:  (a) Mr. Murali Shanmugam (Noticee 3), was a Director of the promoter Adjudication Order in respect of 5 entities in the matter of Pine Animation Ltd.,              Page 4 of 12   entities of PAL, viz. Unique Image Production Private Limited (Noticee 1) as well as of First Entertainment Private Limited (Noticee 2). He has stated that Mr. Nagaraja Sharma Rajagopalan Director of PAL called him up sometime in January 2012 and told him that two persons from Mumbai, namely Mr. Nimesh S Joshi and Mr. Hitesh Kawa  want to buy the shares of PAL held by Unique Image Production Pvt., Ltd., and First Entertainment Pvt., Ltd., Thereafter, he along with Mr. Nagaraja Sharma visited to meet Mr. Nimesh S Joshi and Mr. Hitesh Kawa at their Mumbai Office and discussed about selling the shares of PAL.   (b) Immediately thereafter, Mr. Nimesh S Joshi and Mr. Hitesh Kawa visited Chennai and started working with the RTA, namely, Cameo Corporate Services Ltd., and other people in connection with formalities relating to changing of Directors and transfer of shares. It has been stated that the Noticee 3, 4 and 5 were never Directors of PAL and they were not looking after the affairs of PAL and were associated with the Company only in the capacity of promoters and shareholders  (c) It has been submitted that the promoting companies sent the physical share certificates of PAL held by them (Noticees 1 and 2) along with share transfer forms to Mr. Nimesh S Joshi and Mr. Hitesh Kawa at their Mumbai office in February 2012, by courier. After Mr. Nimesh S Joshi and Mr. Hitesh Kawa got the full control over the company in February 2012, then only they paid our money in March 2012 through RTGS. An amount of \\\\\\\\u20b98,18,250/- was received from Gajakarna Trading Private Ltd., during March 07 & 09, 2012 by the Noticee 2 and an amount of \\\\\\\\u20b97,00,250/- was received from Mahaganpati Financial Services Ltd., on March 9, 2012 by the Noticee 1.  (d) It has been further submitted that the Noticee 3 had received an email from Mr. Hitesh Kawa on September 22, 2012 stating that he will be required to sign some forms to transfer shares as the lock-in on the shares were getting over on October 01, 2012. However, the Noticee 3 had refused to sign on those forms as he believed that when he had sold those shares in February 2012, the shares were without any lock-in period and he was not aware as to how those shares came under lock-in. Copy of the email dated September 22, 2013 intimating the refusal to sign any further document is furnished in support thereof  (e) It has been also submitted that the Mr. Nimesh S Joshi and Mr. Hitesh Kawa were directly involved in the affairs of Company since January 2012. In fact all payments to BSE, RTA (Cameo) and others were made by Mr. Nimesh S Joshi and Mr. Hitesh Kawa. In this connection, several emails written from the email account of Mr. Nimesh S Joshi to others in Adjudication Order in respect of 5 entities in the matter of Pine Animation Ltd.,              Page 5 of 12   connection with affairs of the Company have been furnished, wherein some of the email were marked to Mr. Nagaraja Sharma Rajagopalan and Mr. Hitesh Kawa as well.  (f) We once again reiterate that we have handed over our physical shares and transfer forms to Mr. Nimesh S Joshi and Mr. Hitesh Kawa in February 2012. It has been alleged in the SCN based on the submissions made by the 6 entities vide common letter dated February 29, 2016, that these 6 entities had given loans to the promoters of PAL in March 2012 and since they expressed their inability to repay the loan, they had acquired the shares of PAL offered by the promoter entities. The aforesaid allegation levelled against the promoter entities of PAL is totally wrong.   (g) It is to be noted that when we were selling our shares in January 2012, the shares of PAL were not trading and not listed and it was only physical shares. Then on what basis Mr. Nimesh S Joshi and Mr. Hitesh Kawa decided to give loan against these shares?  (h) It is further submitted that the Directors of the 2 promoter companies viz., Noticees 3 to 5 are real hard core professionals and they don\\\\\\\\u2019t need to borrow money from anybody in the market. In such scenario, why should we go all the way to Mumbai to get the alleged loan of \\\\\\\\u20b915 lacs?   (i) From the attached bank statements of the Noticees 1 and 2, it can be observed that sale proceeds were sitting idle in our account and we have invested again in the NCDs in Tata Capital.   (j) We also like to submit that the Noticees 1 and 2 never borrowed any money from Banks or third party from the date of incorporation.   (k) In support of their reply, the Noticees furnished the following documents  i. A copy of an email dated February 14, 2012 from the email account of Mr. Nimesh S Joshi sending \\\\\\\\u2018consent letters of proposed directors\\\\\\\\u2019 of Four K Animation Ltd. (erstwhile name of PAL) to someone at \\\\\\\\u20183acapital.in\\\\\\\\u2019with a carbon copy of the mail marked to Mr. Hitesh Kawa  ii. An email written from the email account of Mr. Nimesh S Joshi on April 24, 2012 to one Dominic S David of Ascend Management Consultants with a carbon copy to Mr. Nagaraja Sharma Rajagopalan, confirming that they will make payment for RTA and Depository services in a short time and furnished a copy of cheque Adjudication Order in respect of 5 entities in the matter of Pine Animation Ltd.,              Page 6 of 12   dated April 24, 2012 for an amount of \\\\\\\\u20b928,077/- issued by Hitesh Kawa & Co.- Client Account to Cameo Corporate Services Ltd.  iii. An email from the email account of Mr. Nimesh S Joshi sending as an attachment a copy of letter dated April 10, 2012 issued by Cameo to BSE confirming that 9,27,400 shares held by promoters are kept under lock-in.   iv. Copy of e-mail dated July 21, 2012, written by Mr. Nimesh S Joshi from the email id of Four K Animation Ltd. (erstwhile name of PAL) to Mr. Nagaraja Sharma Rajagopalan with carbon copy to the Mr. Hitesh Kawa. In this email, Mr. Nimesh S Joshi refers to his visit to Chennai after the visit of Mr. Nagaraja Sharma Rajagopalan to Mumbai and states that they have repeatedly requested Mr. Nagaraja Sharma Rajagopalan to give the duly signed transfer forms along with his signature.   v. Email from Mr. Hitesh Kawa to the Noticee 3 on September 22, 2012 stating that he will be required to sign on some declaration to transfer shares as the lock-in on the shares were getting over.  8. I am convinced that in view of the submissions made by the Noticees, the instant matter can be decided without being heard, as no prejudice shall be caused to the Noticee. Accordingly, I am proceeding further in the matter.   CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES   9. After perusal of the material available on record, I have the following issues for consideration viz.,   I. Whether the Noticees have violated the provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and 4 (1) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003?  II. Whether the Noticees are liable for monetary penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act?  III. If so, what quantum of monetary penalty should be imposed on the Noticees?

It has been alleged in the SCN that the promoter companies transferred their shareholding in PAL, held in physical form, to six (06) entities, during the periods of January 05, 2013 and February 09, 2013, whereas in terms of the reply furnished by the promoters entities, they have claimed to have transferred their shareholding in PAL to the six (06) entities in March 2012 itself. However, contrary to the said claim, as per the information available in public domain, especially on the BSE website, I note that the above mentioned promoter entities, continued to be shown as promoters of the company till December 2012.  13. I note from the quarterly shareholding pattern for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 that two promoter entities viz., Unique Image Production Pvt., Ltd., and First Entertainment Pvt., Ltd., (Noticees 1 & 2) held 9,27,400 shares in the physical form constituting 30.91% of the total shareholding of PAL. These two Noticees transferred their entire shareholding to the following six entities  between January 05, 2013 and February 09, 2013, the details of which are furnished hereunder: Adjudication Order in respect of 5 entities in the matter of Pine Animation Ltd.,              Page 9 of 12     14. I find that there has been no specific allegations against the promoter entities or their Directors, with respect to their role or collusive nexus, if any, with other Noticees who have allegedly manipulated the share price of PAL or sold the shares of PAL at artificially inflated prices. The SCN merely states the fact that the earlier Chennai based promoter entities and their Directors have transferred their shares in PAL in physical form to six entities located in Mumbai through off-market deals. It is the contention of the promoter entities that on the basis of suggestion and reference from Nagaraja Sharma Rajagopalan, who was the Director of PAL, they came in touch with the prospective buyers of their shares in PAL and accordingly sold their shares to the said buyers located in Mumbai. Rather, it is Nagaraja Sharma Rajagopalan who was a Director of PAL for the period of April 30, 2008 to December 02, 2013, and reportedly mediated between the promoter entities and the six buying entities in Mumbai, can be stated to have connection with the six buying entities who were introduced by him to the promoter entities. Thus, the nexus between the Nagaraja Sharma Rajagopalan and the six buying entities becomes apparent on the basis of submissions made by the promoter entities.   15. In their replies, the Noticees have claimed that the transfer of shares of PAL by them was an outright sale in the year 2012, wherein the Director of PAL viz., Nagaraja Sharma Rajagopalan acted as a link between them being the sellers and Mahaganapti Financial Services Pvt., Ltd., & Gajakarna Trading Pvt., Ltd., being the buyers. However, the 6 entities who received the shares from the Promoter entities contended that the amount paid by them to Noticees 1 and 2 were actually lent by them as loan.

The Noticees in their subsequent replies referred to the Order passed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble WTM on November 18, 2019 on the similar charges as alleged in the instant Adjudication proceedings and requested to take the same on record while deciding the charges levelled against the Noticees. As submitted by the Noticees, I have perused the order of SEBI WTM dated November 18, 2019, which is also based on the same facts. For the purpose of reference, the findings of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble WTM are reproduced hereunder:  \\\\\\\\u201cI find the promoter entities have adequately discharged their onus by demonstrating before me the sale proceeds, which they have actually received against the transfer of shares of PAL. During the proceedings, the promoter entities have also shown their books of accounts etc., to support their submission that they have not taken any loan from any of the six entities\\\\\\\\u201d  \\\\\\\\u201cThus, the strength of evidence for the purpose of deciding as to whether the six entities of Mumbai had actually lent any money to the promoter entities at Chennai, is tilted against the six entities and favours the promoter entities who have satisfactorily demonstrated that the shares of PAL transferred by them to the six entities were as part of an outright sale done against which they had received the sale proceeds into their bank accounts\\\\\\\\u201d.   \\\\\\\\u201cWhether the proceeds received by the Noticees were from sale of shares to the 6 entities or towards loan as contended by the 6 entities, the clinching piece of evidence was Share Transfer Forms (STF), which corroborates the stand of the Noticees. The following observations were made on perusal of the STF: a) The STF for the transfer of shares from Noticees 1 and 2 to 6 entities had a common witness, i.e., Mr. Nagaraja Sharma Rajagoplan, Director, PAL.  b) The shares were transferred to the 6 entities in the year 2013 but the STF contains a stamp of Dy. Registrar of Companies, Tamil Nadu, Adjudication Order in respect of 5 entities in the matter of Pine Animation Ltd.,              Page 11 of 12   Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Chennai, bearing date of February 14, 2012. The said stamp appears to be an endorsement done in compliance of Section 108 (1A) (a) and (b) of Companies Act, 19561.   On the face of the aforesaid documentary evidence, the factum of transfer of shares by the promoter companies, who were located in Chennai to certain entities in Mumbai, cannot be per se alleged to be fraudulent in nature, insofar as the same relates to alleged role of the Noticees. The SCN has not been able to bring on record any evidence to implicate the promoter entities by establishing any nexus, with other Noticees who have either manipulated the share price of PAL or have been responsible for other violations alleged against them in the SCN. In the absence of any evidence against the Noticees as highlighted above, in my considered opinion, the role of Noticees is limited only to the extent of transferring their stake in PAL to the Mumbai based six entities through the help of Mr. Nagaraja Sharma Rajagopalan, hence it would not be right to hold the Noticees as accountable for the scheme of manipulations in the scrip of PAL which occurred subsequent to their transfer whereby the buyers who purchased the shares of PAL through off-market deals from the 6 entities, could exit at a highly inflated artificial price. Accordingly, I find that the allegations of various violations, alleged to have been committed by the aforesaid Noticees are not maintainable for want of merit and supporting evidence. Therefore, the Noticees are exonerated from the charges made against them in the SCN.  17. I am also in agreement with the reasoning given above by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble WTM and find no reason to differ from the same. Accordingly, the allegation that the Noticees were participants in the fraudulent scheme/device that was                                                            1 (1A) Every instrument of transfer of shares shall be in such form as may be prescribed, and - (a) every such form shall, before it is signed by or on behalf of the transferor and before any entry is made therein, be presented to the prescribed authority, being a person already in the service of the Government, who shall stamp or otherwise endorse thereon the date on which it is so presented, and  (b) every instrument of transfer in the prescribed form with the date of such presentation stamped or otherwise endorsed thereon shall, after it is executed by or on behalf of the transferor and the transferee and completed in all other respects, be delivered to the company, -\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d Adjudication Order in respect of 5 entities in the matter of Pine Animation Ltd.,              Page 12 of 12   orchestrated for manipulating the price of scrip of PAL for the benefit of off-market recipients of the shares of the Company, thereby violating the provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003 does not stand established.   18. Since, the alleged violation of the provisions of SEBI Act and SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations does not stand established; Issue II does not require any consideration.  ORDER  19.

In respect of:  S.No. Name of the Entity PAN 1 Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited AACCO3836B   1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) received a reference from Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cBSE\\\\\\\\u201d) with regard to the Market Linked Debentures (\\\\\\\\u201cMLDs\\\\\\\\u201d) issued on private placement basis by Oxyzo Financial Services Private Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticee/Oxyzo/Company\\\\\\\\u201d). Upon examining the reference from BSE, SEBI observed that Oxyzo allotted MLDs on March 01, 2019 stating in the information Memorandum (\\\\\\\\u201cIM\") that the MLDs will be unlisted at the time of issuance and will be listed on the wholesale debt market segment of BSE within 90 business days of the company attaining minimum net worth of INR 100 crores. SEBI further observed that, the net worth of the Company was less than Rs.100 crores at the time of issue of MLDs, which was allegedly in violation of eligibility criteria mentioned at clause 4(c) of SEBI circular no. IMD/DF/17/2011 September 28, 2011, regulation 20(2) of SEBI (Issue and    Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 2 of 25  Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 (in short ILDS Regulations, 2008) read with clause 2(i) of Uniform Listing Agreement. 2. In view of the above, SEBI initiated Adjudication Proceedings against the Noticee under section 15 (I) of Securities and Exchange board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u2018SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2019) to inquire into and adjudge under section 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992, the alleged violations of provisions of clause 4(c) of SEBI circular no. IMD/DF/17/2011 dated September 28. 2011, Regulation 20(2) of ILDS Regulations, 2008 read with clause 2(i) of Uniform Listing Agreement. The Adjudicating Officer (\\\\\\\\u201cAO\\\\\\\\u201d) appointed under the said proceedings issued a show cause notice dated December 17, 2019 to the Noticee to show cause as to why an enquiry should not be held against it and why penalty under Section 15 HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 be not imposed on it for the violations alleged and specified in the SCN.  Thereafter, an opportunity of filing reply and to appear for personal hearing was provided to the Noticee. The said opportunities were availed by the Noticee.  3. After considering the reply / submissions filed by the Noticee and the material on record, the AO vide order dated February 17, 2020 (\\\\\\\\u201cAO Order\\\\\\\\u201d) recorded the following finding: \\\\\\\\u201cIssue a: Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of clause 4(c) of SEBI circular no.  IMD/DF/17/2011  September  28,  2011,  regulation  20(2)  of  ILDS Regulations, 2008 r/w clause 2(i) of Uniform Listing Agreement.? a) It  is  alleged  in  the  said  SCN that  Noticee  issued  MLDs  without  satisfying the eligibility condition for issuance i.e. to have networth of Rs. 100 Cr at the time of issuance, which is prescribed as per clause 4 (c) of the said SEBI circular with the premise that such securities (MLDs) expose issuer to market risk. I note that market  risk  by  definition  is  systemic  risk  embedded  in  the  market  owing  to exogenous factors  (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/ marketrisk.asp) and investor is exposed to market risk. In reply to the SCN, the Noticee has broadly contended that 1) the only allottee (investor) of the said issue had issued the term sheet having done due diligence and having the knowledge that MLDs will remain    Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 3 of 25  unlisted at issuance uptill 90 days of Noticee attaining Rs. 100 Cr networth, 2) the said circular talks about criteria at the time of listing and that Noticee has complied  with this criterion at the time of  seeking listing  on May 18, 2019, 3) Noticee had attained net worth of Rs.100 crore on March 22, 2019, 4) Noticee misinterpreted inadvertently that Noticee needed to comply with Net worth criteria at the time of Listing only and 5) that it has redeemed the said MLDs and returned the money to the said investor with penal  interest in terms of the termsheet. b) As regards, the allegation of OD and contentions of Noticee, the question before me is whether the Noticee needed to comply with clause 4(c) of the said circular at the time of issuance and not just at the time of listing. As regards, the other two violation provisions mentioned in the SCN, I note that clause 2(i) of Uniform Listing Agreement binds the issuer company to comply with relevant byelaws / regulations / circulars / notices / guidelines issued by the stock exchange from time to time, and that regulation 20(2) of ILDS Regulations, 2008 is binding upon the issuer to comply with conditions of listing of such debt securities as specified in the Listing Agreement with the stock exchange where such debt securities are sought to be listed. These are both triggered chronologically after securities are issued and in the instant matter at the time of issuance there is alleged violation of the clause 4(c) of the said circular by the Noticee. Thus, the question before me  is  whether  Noticee  needed  to  have  complied  with  clause  4(c)  of  the  said circular (i) only at the time of listing or (ii) at the time of issuance and later on at the time of listing. c) The said circular has been issued under regulation 31(2)(c) of ILDS Regulations,2008 under the heading, power of the Board to issue general order or circular, which reads  as  \\\\\\\\u201cIn  particular,  and  without  prejudice  to  the  generality  of  the foregoing power and provisions of these regulations, such orders or circulars may provide for all or any of the following matters, namely: (a) \\\\\\\\u2026. ; (b) \\\\\\\\u2026.; (c) Listing conditions. Hence, applicability of the said circular stems from    Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 4 of 25  the applicability of ILDS  Regulations,  2008.  It  is  imperative  to  refer  to  regulation  3  of  ILDS Regulations, 2008, which specifies the applicability of said Regulations, states that, \\\\\\\\u201cThese regulations shall apply to- (a) public issue of debt securities; and listing of debt securities issued through public issue or on private placement basis on  recognized  stock  exchange\\\\\\\\u201d.  Literal  reading  of  regulation  3(1)(a)  of  ILDS Regulations, 2008 shows that the said regulation is applicable for public issue of debt securities and regulation 3(1)(b) ILDS Regulations, 2008 is for listing of debt securities  issued  through  public  issue  and  private  placement.  Further, as per definition   of   public   issue   as   prescribed   under   regulation   2(1)(i)   of   ILDS Regulations, 2008 \\\\\\\\u201cpublic issue means an offer or invitation by an issuer to public to  subscribe  to  the  debt  securities  which  is  not  in  the  nature  of  a  private placement\\\\\\\\u201d. In view of the above, it is noted that applicability of ILDS Regulation,2008 as prescribed under regulation 3(1)(a) of ILDS Regulation, 2008 is only for public issue of debt securities and not for private placement. I note that while the subject of the said SEBI circular which is issued under enabling clause 31(2)(c) of ILDS Regulations, 2008 for listing conditions states, \\\\\\\\u201cGuidelines for Issue and Listing of Structured/Market Linked Debentures\\\\\\\\u201d, the clause 4 specifically mentions about various conditions including the Eligibility criteria for issuer (issuer should have a minimum networth of Rs. 100 crore) shall be complied with in respect of listing of structured debt/ equity linked debentures. In the spirit of ILDS Regulations, 2008, which is making specific distinction between issue and listing of debt securities through private placement. I also read clause 4(c) of SEBI circular no. IMD/DF/17/2011 September 28, 2011 in the same light and it augur that listing and issuance are  two  distinct  actions  when  it  comes  to privately placed debt, unless specifically mentioned, the listing criteria cannot be construed as issuance criteria. Thus, Noticee needed to comply with clause 4(c) at the time of listing. However, as seen from the reply of the Noticee, the said MLDs were not listed, hence, the said    Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 5 of 25  allegation of non-compliance of clause 4(c) of the said Circular does not stand established. d) In view of the above, I am of the view Noticee did not violate the provisions of clause 4(c) of SEBI circular no. IMD/DF/17/2011 September 28, 2011, regulation 20(2) of ILDS Regulations, 2008 r/w clause 2(i) of Listing Agreement. Therefore, the alleged violations against the Noticee in the SCN does not stand established and hence issues (b) and (c) do not arise\\\\\\\\u201d. 4. In view of the above reasons, the AO disposed of the Show Cause Notice dated December 17, 2019 without imposition of any penalty on the Noticee.  Proceedings under Section 15-I (3) of the SEBI Act: 5. SEBI, after examining the AO order dated February 17, 2020, was of the opinion that the said AO order, in as much as not holding the Noticee liable for imposition of penalty under section 15 HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 was erroneous and not in the interest of the securities market. 6. In view of the above, SEBI issued a Show Cause Notice dated May 6, 2020 under section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act to the Noticee advising the Noticee to show cause as to why appropriate penalty should not be imposed against the Noticee in terms of section 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992, for the violation as alleged in SCN dated December 17, 2019, issued by AO. It was also mentioned therein that the contents of the show cause notice dated May 6, 2020 shall be read along with the previous SCN dated December 17, 2019 issued by the AO.  The SCN further advised the Noticee to file a reply to the SCN within 21 days of its receipt and to indicate whether they wish to avail of an opportunity of hearing before Whole Time Member, SEBI.    Reply of the Noticee 7. In response to the SCN, the Noticee vide reply dated May 20, 2020 inter alia made the following submissions:    Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 6 of 25  I. \\\\\\\\u201cthat the Noticee had submitted Reply (Reply before AO\\\\\\\\u201d) vide letter dated January 03, 2020 against the show cause notice (\\\\\\\\u201cSCN of AO\\\\\\\\u201d) dated December 17, 2019  and vide hearing Notice (\\\\\\\\u201cFirst HN\\\\\\\\u201d) dated January 09 2020, an opportunity of hearing was granted to the Noticee, scheduled on January 22, 2020. Further to which, vide order dated February 17, 2020, (\\\\\\\\u201cOrder of AO\\\\\\\\u201d) in exercise of the power conferred under section 15-I of the SEBI Act, the Adjudicating officer had disposed-off the adjudicating proceedings initiated against the Noticee without imposing any monetary penalty. II. Vide another Show Cause Notice dated May 06, 2020 (\\\\\\\\u201cSCN under Section 15 I (3)\\\\\\\\u201d) that the said AO\\\\\\\\u2019s order, is erroneous and not in the interest of the securities market in as much as the matter has not been decided on the merits of the case and directed to submit the reply to the aforesaid show cause notice(\\\\\\\\u201cSCN under Section 15 I (3)\\\\\\\\u201d) within period of 21 days from the date of receipt of said notice. III. Since aforesaid SCN shall be read along with the SCN dated December 17, 2019 issued by AO, at the outset, quickly summarising the nature of issue in the Notice: Brief detail of Issue: Company has issued 1700 rated, unsubordinated, secured, redeemable, principal -protected Market linked debenture of face value of Rs. 100,000/- each aggregating up to Rs. 17 crores on private placement basis to IFMR FImpact Income Builder Fund (Debenture holder/ Investor) and Vistra ITCL (India) Ltd. acted as Debenture Trustee and KFin Technologies Private Limited acted as Registrar to the Issue.  IV. In this matter, we respectfully submit the following in response to the SCN under reference: i. The Company without prejudice to the contentions of violation of SEBI circular no. IMD/DF/17/2011 September 28, 2011, not satisfying the eligibility criteria with regards to Net worth of Rs. 100 crores as prescribed  under said circular, would like to submit that at the time of issuance, Investor/ Debenture holder was well acquainted with the fact that the net worth of the company is less than INR    Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 7 of 25  100 Crores and after due deliberate discussion around interpretation of the clause, Investor/ Subscriber had issued a term sheet dated February 28, 2019 for issue of 1700 rated, unsubordinated, secured, redeemable, principal -protected Market linked debenture of face value of Rs. 100,000/- each aggregating up to Rs. 17 crores on private placement basis with the clause-  \\\\\\\\u201cthe MLD will be unlisted at the time of issuance and will be listed in the wholesale debt market segment of BSE within 90 business days of the Company attaining minimum net worth of INR 100 crores\\\\\\\\u201d ii. Thus, leading to inclusion of similar language as the listing point under clause 5.23 regarding the issue details in Information memorandum issued by the Company, which was as follows: \\\\\\\\u201cUnlisted at the time of issuance. To be listed in the wholesale debt market segment of BSE within 90 days of the Company attaining minimum net worth of INR 100 crores\\\\\\\\u201d iii. Request your good-self to kindly consider the fact that there has been no mendacious/malafide intention behind the aforesaid issue as the clause was suggested/ offered by the investor/debenture holder itself in the term sheet with the full knowledge of the financial information of the Noticee. Subsequently, Information Memorandum issued by the company had been aligned with the Term Sheet keeping in view the interest of Investor/ Debenture holder and other stakeholders to the aforesaid issue.  iv. In continuation to above para submission, we would like to reiterate that the listing clause has been suggested/ offered by the Investor/ Debenture Holder via the term sheet dated February 28, 2019 and keeping in view the interest and requirement of Investor/ Debenture Holder only, the company has aligned the listing cause of Information Memorandum with the same as mentioned in term sheet issued by the Investor/ Debenture Holder. Further, considering the mandates and objectives of SEBI circular no. IMD/DF/17/2011 September 28, 2011, and particularly taking into consideration the Debenture holder and    Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 8 of 25  Trustee\\\\\\\\u2019s interest in relation to the aforesaid issue, company has also complied with the mentioned clause by applying for listing after attaining net worth of Rs. 100 crores and in this regard, on May 20, 2019, shared the undertaking to BSE that the company has attained the net worth of Rs. 100 crores on March 22, 2019.  v. Kindly note that, we completely agree to the fact that such Market Linked Securities carry a different risk-return relationship and with the same view in mind had successfully completed a detailed due diligence process / risk evaluation process conducted by the Investor prior to issuance of term sheet/ opening of issue leading to Investor having a full knowledge of the financial position of the company & the types of risks involved before the issuance itself.  vi. Further, please note that as soon as the company received a confirmation from SEBI on the non-eligibility of the issuance and with conscious discussions with the investor, company has taken the required actions to prepay the principal amount along with the due interest for the said period to the investor/ Debenture Holder.  vii. Thus, we request you to kindly consider the fact that the company had no intention to violate the aforesaid SEBI circular or to harm the interests of the investor/ debenture holder since the terms of issuance was pre-agreed with the investor and with no malafide objective or intention. viii. Further, please record our submission with respect to following regulations: \\\\\\\\uf0d8 clause 4 (c) of SEBI circular no. IMD/DF/17/2011 September 28, 2011-  At the outset, we would like to draw your kind attention that clause 4 (c) of said SEBI circular states about conditions to be complied at the time of Listing as \\\\\\\\u201cThe following conditions shall be complied with in respect of listing of structured debt/ equity linked debentures: \\\\\\\\uf0d8 clause 4 (c) -Eligibility criteria for issuers: As such securities expose the issuer to market risk, the issuer should have a minimum net worth of at least`100cr. \\\\\\\\uf0d8 The Company has complied this criterion at the time of seeking listing.

Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 9 of 25  \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Outrightly, the objective of this circular is to follow the Guidelines for Issue and Listing of Structured Products/ Market Linked by the issuer. \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Hence, we here submit that, it was interpreted that we need to comply with Net worth criteria at the time of Listing only as per clause 4 of SEBI circular no. IMD/DF/17/2011 September 28, 2011 which we had complied also as mentioned earlier that the Company had attained Net worth of Rs. 100 Crores on March 22, 2019 and had applied for listing on May 18, 2019.  \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Further, it was confirmed by the AO\\\\\\\\u2019s order dated February 17, 2020 that Noticee did not violate the provisions of clause 4(c) of SEBI circular no. IMD/DF/17/2011 September 28, 2011 and regulation 20(2) of ILDS Regulations, 2008 r/w clause 2(i) of Listing Agreement  \\\\\\\\u2026 ix.

Further as stated above, your good -self will consider that there was no mendacious intention with respect to aforesaid issue therefore, we had mentioned listing clause in offer disclosure documents with the condition of attaining Net worth of Rs. 100 crores. Hence, we counter the statement made in the show cause notice under reference, that the Company has violated  clause 4 (c) of SEBI circular no. IMD/DF/17/2011 September 28, 2011 and regulation 20 of SEBI (Issue and listing of Debt securities) Regulation, 2008 ( ILDS Regulation, 2008) read with clause 2 (i) of uniform Listing Agreement  intentionally since interpretation from the Literal reading of guidelines for Issue and Listing of Structured/Market Linked Debentures\", the clause 4 specifically mentions about various conditions including the Eligibility criteria for issuer (issuer should have a minimum net worth of Rs. 100 crore) shall be complied with in respect of listing of structured debt/ equity linked debentures and  regulation 3(1)(a) of ILDS    Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 10 of 25  Regulations, 2008 shows that the said regulation is applicable for public issue of debt securities only and regulation 3(1)(b) ILDS Regulations, 2008 is for listing of debt securities issued through public issue and private placement. Also, it was pre-agreed with the investor, inadvertent and with no malafide objective or intention. xi.

On June 18, 2020, Mr. Brij Kishore, Mr. Bhavesh Keswani and Mr. Ayushi Aggarwal, Authorised Representatives of Oxyzo appeared for the hearing through video conference and made the following submissions: i.

I have considered the order passed by the AO dated February 17, 2020, the material relied upon by the AO, the show cause notice dated May 6, 2020, the reply filed by the Noticee along with documents contained therein and oral submissions made by the Noticee during hearing, documents filed by the Noticee post hearing and other material available on record. In the facts and circumstances of the case and in light of the above material available on record, the issues arising for consideration in the present proceeding are as under: i. Whether the interpretation in the order of AO regarding the Clause 4 (c) of the aforesaid Circular is erroneous to the extent it is not in the interests of the securities market requiring the invocation  Section 15-I (3) of the SEBI Act, 1992.   ii. If so whether the requirement of Clause 4 (c) of the aforesaid Circular for having net worth of Rs.100 crore is to be satisfied at the time of listing or at the time of issuance.  iii. Whether the Noticee violated Clause 4(c) of SEBI circular no.  IMD/DF/17/2011 September 28, 2011?  13. Before dealing with the issues for consideration in the present proceedings, I note that the relevant provisions involved in the present matter: ILDS Regulations, 2008  Applicability    Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 13 of 25  3. \\\\\\\\u201cThese regulations shall apply to- (a) public issue of debt securities; and (b) listing of debt securities issued through public issue or on private placement basis on recognized stock exchange\\\\\\\\u201d.  Conditions for listing of debt securities issued on private placement basis 20. (1) An issuer may list its debt securities issued on private placement basis on a recognized stock exchange subject to the following conditions: (a)  the  issuer  has  issued  such  debt  securities  in  compliance  with  the provisions of the Companies Act,1956, rules prescribed thereunder and other applicable laws; (b) credit rating has been obtained in respect of such debt securities from at least one credit rating agency registered with the Board; (c) the debt securities proposed to be listed are in dematerialized form ; (d) the disclosures as provided in regulation 21 have been made. (e)  where  the  application  is  made  to  more  than  one  recognized  stock exchange, the issuer shall choose one of them as the designated stock exchange. (2) The issuer shall comply with conditions of listing of such debt securities as specified in the Listing Agreement with the stock exchange where such debt securities are sought to be listed. (3) The designated stock exchange shall collect a regulatory fee as specified in Schedule V from the issuer at the time of listing of debt securities issued on private placement basis.  Regulation 31-Power of the Board to issue general order or circular.    Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 14 of 25  \\\\\\\\u201c31 (2) \\\\\\\\u201cIn particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power and provisions of these regulations, such orders or circulars may provide for all or any of the following matters, namely: \\\\\\\\u2026 (c) Listing conditions.\\\\\\\\u201d  \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI circular no. IMD/DF/17/2011 September 28, 2011 Sub: Guidelines for Issue and Listing of Structured Products/ Market Linked Debentures 1. SEBI had prescribed initial and continuous disclosure norms applicable to issue and listing of debt securities  through the  Securities  and  Exchange Board of India (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 and the Simplified Listing Agreement for Debt Securities.  2. It has been observed that a variety of hybrid securities that combine features of plain vanilla debt securities and exchange traded derivatives are being issued through private placements and listed on stock exchanges. It is seen that such securities differ from plain vanilla debt securities or debt securities issued with embedded call or put options, i.e., by offering market linked returns obtained through exposures  on  exchange  traded  derivatives.  Since such returns  are linked   to   equity   markets,   such   securities   are   also   called   equity   linked debentures or stock linked debentures etc.  3. In view of the fact that such securities are different in their nature and their risk return relationship, it has been decided to specify additional disclosures and other requirements in offer documents for issue of structured products/ market linked debentures that seek listing on stock exchanges.    Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 15 of 25   4. The following conditions shall be complied with in respect of listing of structured debt/ equity linked debentures: a) Applicability: These guidelines shall be applicable to \\\\\\\\u2018structured products\\\\\\\\u2019 or \\\\\\\\u2018market linked debentures\\\\\\\\u2019, by whatever name they are called including all such securities that have an underlying principal component in the form of debt securities as defined under R.2(d) of SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 and where the returns are linked to market returns on other underlying securities/ indices.  b) Securities which do not promise to return the principal amount in full at the end of the tenor of the instrument, i.e., \\\\\\\\u2018principal non-protected\\\\\\\\u2019 shall not be considered as debt securities under R.2(d) of SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 and therefore will not be eligible for issue and listing under the said regulations. c) Eligibility  criteria  for  issuers:  As  such  securities  expose  the  issuer  to market  risk,  the  issuer  should  have  a  minimum  net  worth  of  at  least Rs.100cr. \\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d  ISSUE NO. I and II i. Whether the interpretation in the order of AO regarding the Clause 4 (c) of the aforesaid Circular is erroneous to the extent it is not in the interests of the securities market requiring the invocation Section 15-I (3) of the SEBI Act, 1992.   ii. If so whether the requirement of Clause 4 (c) of the aforesaid Circular for having net worth of Rs.100 crore is to be satisfied at the time of listing or at the time of issuance.    Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 16 of 25      14. The impugned AO order has imposed no penalty on the basis of an interpretation of ILDS Regulation 2008 vis-a-vis Clause 4(c) of SEBI circular no.  IMD/DF/17/2011 September 28, 2011. The current show cause notice has been issued under Section 15-I (3) of the SEBI Act on the ground that such order is erroneous to the extent it is not in the interest of the securities market.   15. I note that in order to invoke powers under Section 15-I (3) of the SEBI Act, it is necessary to examine whether the AO Order is erroneous to the extent it is not in the interest of securities market. In this regard it is essential to analyze the reasoning of the AO which is based on the following premises:-  i. These regulations apply to two different categories viz., \\\\\\\\uf0b7 first category:- public issue of debt securities;   \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Second category:- listing of debt securities issued through public issue or on private placement basis on  recognized  stock  exchange. ii. Regulation 3(1)(a) of  ILDS Regulations, 2008 is applicable to the first category and  Regulation 3(1)(b) ILDS Regulations, 2008 is applicable to the second category. iii. The applicability of ILDS Regulations, 2008 as prescribed under regulation 3(1)(a) of ILDS Regulation, 2008 is only for public issue of debt securities and not for private placement  iv. SEBI circular no. IMD/DF/17/2011 dated September 28, 2011 has been issued under enabling clause of Regulation 31(2)(c) of ILDS Regulations, 2008. v. Listing and issuance are two distinct actions when it comes to privately placed debt, unless specifically mentioned, the listing criteria cannot be construed as    Order in the matter of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited  Page 17 of 25  issuance criteria. vi. The clause 4 of SEBI circular dated September 28, 2011 specifically mentions about various conditions including the Eligibility criteria for issuer (issuer should have a minimum networth of Rs. 100 crore) shall be complied with in respect of listing of structured debt/ equity linked debentures. vii. Thus, Noticee needed to comply with clause 4(c) only at the time of listing.  16. As stated by the AO, ILDS Regulations applies to two different categories. Regulation 3(a) states that the Regulations applies to the first category and Reg. 3(b) states that it applies to the second category. When it comes to the third point, I note that the ILDS Regulations does not specify the particulars of any provisions which are issued under Regulation 3(a) of the ILDS Regulations. However, the entire provisions have to be read and categorized whether a particular provision is in respect of the first category or the second category. As stated in the said circular the same has been issued under Section 11(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 read with Regulation 31(2)(c) of ILDS Regulations. Therefore, the circular is providing for listing conditions. In point No. 4, the AO order makes a distinction between action of listing and action of issuance in case of private placement of debt and concludes since action of listing and action of issuance is distinct, unless specifically mentioned, the listing criteria cannot be construed as issuance criteria. \\\\\\\\u201cThe Points at 4 to 6 together would show that listing criteria has to be complied with at the time of listing\\\\\\\\u201d. The reasoning adopted in the AO order however, carves out an exception that \\\\\\\\u201cunless specifically mentioned\\\\\\\\u201d listing criteria has to be complied at the tim", "Date": "2020-11-20", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Order passed by WTM u/s 15-I (3) of the SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of Oxyzo Financial Services Private Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/nov-2020/order-passed-by-wtm-u-s-15-i-3-of-the-sebi-act-1992-in-respect-of-oxyzo-financial-services-private-limited_48225.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 57110, "unique_record_id": "afd118018eSEBI20201120", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6680420778589103064710d8", "parse_date": "2024-06-29 17:18:30", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Administration Proceedings", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "No financial penalties are mentioned in the article.", "gpt_audience": "1. **Regulatory Authorities**\n   - Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\n   - Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)\n   - Reserve Bank of India (RBI)\n\n2. **Financial Institutions**\n   - Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)\n   - Investment Banks\n   - Credit Rating Agencies\n\n3. **Legal and Compliance Professionals**\n   - Corporate Lawyers\n   - Compliance Officers\n   - Legal Advisors\n\n4. **Investors**\n   - Institutional Investors\n   - Retail Investors\n   - Debenture Holders\n\n5. **Corporate Entities**\n   - Companies issuing Market Linked Debentures (MLDs)\n   - Debenture Trustees\n   - Registrars to the Issue\n\n6. **Financial Analysts and Consultants**\n   - Financial Analysts\n   - Market Consultants\n   - Risk Management Professionals\n\n7. **Academic and Research Institutions**\n   - Business Schools\n   - Research Scholars in Finance and Law\n   - Policy Think Tanks\n\n8. **Media and Financial Journalists**\n   - Financial News Reporters\n   - Business Journalists\n   - Financial Bloggers", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

The following information is gathered from the bank KYC/AOF:  Bank Name of Account holder Date of Account Opening ICICI Bank Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani August 18, 2011   Hence, the bank account mentioned on the website of T4M belongs to an individual namely Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani. The address of Mr. Mahesh Ramani__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Tips4Market (Prop. Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani)    Page 5 of 17 mentioned is: 423, Kumar Pra Shala, Navolo Vista, Shriram Plot, Lilapur 2, Jasdan Rajkot 360050.  7. The following information is gathered from the bank account statement (upto 05/11/2020):  Account Number & Bank Period for which bank statement is obtained Total Credits (Rs.) Last Credit Transaction date Closing Balance (Rs.) 025201524531 (ICICI Bank) 29-08-2011 to 05-11-2020 96,60,532.27 November 02, 2020 12,39,784 (as on November 05, 2020)  Hence, it can be seen that the account is active as on date and receiving continuous credits, with the last credit of Rs. 7500/- received on November 02, 2020. The narration of this credit is \\\\\\\\u201cMMT/IMPS/030721277709/SureshShareMark/RAJKUMAR K t\\\\\\\\u201d. It can be seen that for several credit descriptions the words \\\\\\\\u201cshare market\\\\\\\\u201d, \\\\\\\\u201cstock market\\\\\\\\u201d, \\\\\\\\u201ctrade\\\\\\\\u201d, etc., appear in the narration.   8. Considering the analysis of the details on the website of T4M and information from the account opened with the banks, I, prima facie, observe that T4M has represented that it is an investment advisory firm for advice on stocks and commodity markets.  9. Considering the above facts and circumstances, especially the contents of the website of T4M coupled with the credit transactions directly made in the bank account of Mr. Mahesh Ramani, as detailed above, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees/ funds credited to the bank account, were for the purpose of providing the services indicated on the website of T4M. From the domain details available from whois.com, it can be seen that the website of T4M was created on October 02, 2012. However, from the bank statement, it can be seen that between the period starting from date of account opening till October, 02, 2012, there are credit transactions with narrations such as \\\\\\\\u201cLive tips market\\\\\\\\u201d, \\\\\\\\u201cShare Market\\\\\\\\u201d, \\\\\\\\u201cLive tips market research\\\\\\\\u201d etc., which, prima facie,__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Tips4Market (Prop. Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani)    Page 6 of 17 indicate that funds were being collected even before this specific website was created. Hence, as reflected from the bank statement, I note that, prima facie, T4M has commenced with the collection of fees/ funds for the purpose of providing the services from August 2011 and has continued the same, at least till the period of examination.  10. It is, prima facie, observed that T4M is placing information about various services offered by it in the securities market, in public domain by using its website. Further, it is also, prima facie, observed that various packages are being offered by T4M through its website to avail its services. The website categorically mentions the \\\\\\\\u201cadvantages of availing its services in various fields of securities market\\\\\\\\u201d and the advice they offer to their clients in the securities market through daily SMSs.  11. In this regard, I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d  12. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is observed from the contents of the website that T4M is holding itself out as investment adviser by, prima facie, offering to provide services related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription and as such, these services fall within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advice\\\\\\\\u201d under Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations. Further, multiple credit entries have been received in the bank account, which when seen together with the contents of the website, leads to, on preponderance of probability basis, a, prima facie, conclusion that the credit entries in the bank account__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Tips4Market (Prop. Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani)    Page 7 of 17 are for consideration for the investment advice given by T4M to its clients. Thus, prima facie, T4M is an investment adviser as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations.  13. Therefore, T4M has not only held itself out as an investment adviser but has also acted as an investment adviser for consideration.  Issue No.2: If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether T4M has, prima facie, violated any provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) read with SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (\\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d)?  14. In order to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  15. Further, as per Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations, the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Tips4Market (Prop. Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani)    Page 8 of 17 16. It is noted that T4M is not registered with SEBI in the capacity of an investment adviser, while the characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by it, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, lead to the conclusion that it is holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser without a certificate of registration.   17. In my view, these activities/ representations of T4M without holding the certificate of registration as an investment adviser is, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.  Issue No.3 If answers to Issue Nos. (1) & (2) are affirmative, who are all responsible for the violations?  18. I note that Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani is the sole proprietor of T4M. Further, the money received for the unregistered activities of T4M have been credited to a bank account held in the name of Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani with ICICI Bank. I note the legal status of a proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme court in Ashok Transport Agency v. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567], wherein it was stated that:  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026..A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business. . A suit by or against a proprietary concern is by or against the proprietor of the business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d.  19. Therefore, I find that Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani is liable for the acts of T4M.  Issue No. 4: If answer to Issue No. (2) is affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any should be issued against those responsible for the violations?__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Tips4Market (Prop. Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani)    Page 9 of 17 20. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of regulating activities related to investment advice to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration for such activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations, inter alia, seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the criteria set out in the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market.  21. In the instant case, T4M is soliciting and inducing members of the public to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration/certification as mandated under the IA Regulations. Further, it is noted from material available on record, that the website is active as on date and money has been credited to the bank account even recently during the period of examination. Thus, the entity and its bank account is active and can continue to be used to collect fees from unsuspecting members of the public.   22. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the, prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent T4M from collecting any more fees from the public and from indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. I note that the website is active as on date. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered services provided by T4M in the securities market is still in existence and imminent. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by T4M is Rs. 96,60,532/- and the same indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Tips4Market (Prop. Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani)    Page 10 of 17 23. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from an unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from unregistered investment advisor vis-a-vis an investor who receives such service from a SEBI registered investment adviser stands at a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged under the IA Regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not even satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment adviser. Availing such services from unregistered entities is detrimental to investors and such unregistered service would result in irreparable damage as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victims of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury/ detriment to the development of the securities market also qualifies as an \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d. The objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market.  24. Further, if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may have to part with large fees and investments resulting into irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is the right of the current entity herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the ex-parte orders in the case of private suits and ex-parte public enforcement actions, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential deployment of funds by the investors by following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Tips4Market (Prop. Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani)    Page 11 of 17 securities market, cannot be retrieved, if, prima facie, unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing an exparte-interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favour of T4M and its Proprietor.    25. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the, prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent T4M and its proprietor from collecting any more fees from the public and from indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities.   26. I note that the amount of Rs. 96,60,532/- has been collected in the bank accounts of T4M. In light of the same, I find that there is no other alternative but to take recourse through an interim ex-parte order against T4M and its proprietor, Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani, for preventing them from collecting funds by indulging in unauthorized investment advisory services without obtaining the mandatory registrations from SEBI in accordance with the law. As the website and bank account is active, the balance of convenience demands the preventive measure of stopping the collection of money from investors in the bank account linked with T4M, which is nothing but the bank account of its proprietor. The same can be effectively achieved by an appropriate direction of stopping the credit into the bank account of the Proprietor of T4M. As T4M and its Proprietor have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by, prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, the balance of convenience also demands that T4M and its Proprietor need to be prevented from diverting the funds collected from the investors through the unauthorized investment advisory activity. Accordingly, an appropriate direction stopping the debit from the bank account of the Proprietor of T4M has been incorporated.  27. With the initiation of quasi-judicial proceedings, it is highly probable that T4M may divert the money collected from the subscribers/ clients. The same may result in__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Tips4Market (Prop. Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani)    Page 12 of 17 defeating the effective implementation of the direction of refund, if any, to be passed after deciding the matter on merits. It therefore becomes necessary for SEBI to take urgent steps to prevent T4M from diverting the money collected from the subscribers / clients. It is also essential to take urgent steps to prevent them from alienating any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets, so that the final remedies, if any, do not become infructuous. In view of the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove, and considering the interests of already existing clients of T4M and also the interests of those who may fall prey to the unregistered investment advisory by reaching T4M through the website, the balance of convenience lies against T4M, and requires immediate action against them including not to divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients / investors.   Order  28. In view of the above, pending conclusion of enquiry on granting of hearing opportunity as per this Order to T4M/ its Proprietor Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me by virtue of Section 19 read with Sections 11, 11(4), 11B(1) and 11D read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992, hereby issue by way of this interim ex-parte order, the following directions:   28.1. T4M and its Proprietor Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani (PAN: AMUPR3076P) are directed to:  28.1.1. Cease and desist from acting as an investment advisor including the activity of acting and representing through any media (physical or digital) as an investment advisor, directly or indirectly, and cease to solicit or undertake such activity or any other activities in the securities market, directly or indirectly, in any matter whatsoever, until further orders.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Tips4Market (Prop. Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani)    Page 13 of 17 28.1.2. Not to divert any funds raised from investors, kept in bank account(s) and/or in their custody until further orders. 28.1.3. Not to dispose of or alienate any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge on any of such assets held in their name, including money lying in bank accounts except with the prior permission of SEBI. 28.1.4. Immediately withdraw and remove all advertisements, representations, literatures, brochures, materials, publications, documents, communications etc., physical or digital in relation to their investment advisory activity or any other unregistered activity in the securities market until further orders. 28.1.5. Not to access the securities market and buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, until further orders. 28.1.6. To provide a full inventory of all assets held in their name, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge on any of such assets, including details of all bank accounts, demat accounts and mutual fund investments, immediately but not later than 5 working days from the date of receipt of this order.   28.2. If T4M/ its Proprietor Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani have any open positions in any exchange traded derivative contracts, as on the date of the order, they can close out/ square off such open positions within 3 months from the date of this Order or at the expiry of such contracts, whichever is earlier. T4M/ its Proprietor Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani are permitted to settle the pay-in and pay-out obligations in respect of transactions, if any, which have taken place before the close of trading on the date of this Order.  28.3. ICICI Bank, wherein the proprietor of T4M, Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani, is holding bank account with number 025201524531, is directed not to allow any__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Tips4Market (Prop. Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani)    Page 14 of 17 debits/ withdrawals from and credits to the said accounts, without the permission of SEBI. The bank is directed to ensure that all the above directions are strictly enforced.  28.4. The Depositories are directed to ensure that till further directions no debits are made in the demat accounts of T4M and its Proprietor Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani. The Registrar and Transfer Agents are also directed to ensure that till further directions the securities, including Mutual Fund units, held in the name of T4M and its Proprietor Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani, jointly or singly, are not transferred or redeemed.  29. Pending enquiry on the grant of hearing opportunity to T4M and its Proprietor Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani, the observations contained in this Order are made on the basis of the material available on record and are based on a strong, prima facie, case keeping in view the urgency and the balance of convenience in the interest of investors. In this context, T4M and its Proprietor Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani may file the objections and/or request for personal hearing, if any, receivable by SEBI within 21 (twenty-one) days from the date of serving of this Order on them (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cprescribed period\\\\\\\\u201d) and, if they so desire, contest the findings.  30. This Order shall also be treated as a Show Cause Notice and T4M and its Proprietor Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani are show caused as to why the investment advisory plans floated by them should not be held as \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advisory Services\\\\\\\\u201d in terms of the IA Regulations and thereby the activity of T4M be treated as unregistered activity under the SEBI Act and relevant Regulations.  31. T4M and its Proprietor Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani are also show caused as to why appropriate directions, under Sections 11, 11(4), 11B(1) and 11D of the SEBI Act and relevant SEBI Rules/Regulations, including directions to prohibit them from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities market, either directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, for a particular period, directions not to be associated with__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Tips4Market (Prop. Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani)    Page 15 of 17 any registered intermediary/ listed entity in the securities market, in any manner whatsoever, and direction to refund the amount collected from the investors/clients for its various schemes should not be issued against them under Sections 11 and 11B (1) of SEBI Act.  32. If the objections or the request for personal hearing, if any, are not received by SEBI within the prescribed period, then it shall be construed that T4M and its Proprietor Mr. Mahesh Vaghajibhai Ramani have no objections to offer and have admitted the findings/allegations that have been made against them in this Order.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) conducted an investigation to ascertain whether shares underlying Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) of Tulsi Extrusions Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cTulsi\\\\\\\\u201d/ \\\\\\\\u201cCompany\\\\\\\\u201d) were issued with proper consideration and whether appropriate disclosures in compliance with the Listing Agreement, if any, were made by Tulsi with respect to the GDRs to the Stock Exchanges. The period under investigation was during issuance of GDRs i.e. August 01, 2010 to September 30, 2010 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cinvestigation period\\\\\\\\u201d). 2. Tulsi was a Company listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBSE\\\\\\\\u201d) and National Stock Exchange Ltd., (NSE), issued 1,250,000 GDRs (amounting US$14.325 million) at US$11.46 each representing 12,500,000 underlying Equity Shares of \\\\\\\\u20b910/- each at \\\\\\\\u20b954/- on August 23, 2010. The investigation revealed that European American Investment Bank AG (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cEURAM Bank\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cBank\\\\\\\\u201d) had granted loan to Vintage FZE Adjudication Order 6 entities in the matter of Tulsi Extrusions Ltd.,   Page 2 of 33  (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cVintage\\\\\\\\u201d) by way of a Loan Agreement dated August 11, 2010 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cLoan Agreement\\\\\\\\u201d) for making payment towards subscription to the entire GDR issued by Tulsi. The loan amount sanctioned to Vintage was the same as the amount of GDR issued by Tulsi i.e., USD 14.325 million, and, it was observed that the entire 1.25 million GDRs were subscribed by only one entity, i.e. Vintage.  3. Investigation further revealed that the Company had pledged the entire GDR proceeds to EURAM Bank as security against the loan availed by Vintage from EURAM Bank for subscribing to GDRs of Tulsi by entering into a Pledge Agreement dated August 11, 2010 with EURAM Bank (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPledge Agreement\\\\\\\\u201d). The aforesaid Pledge Agreement was found to be an integral part of the Loan Agreement entered into between Vintage and EURAM Bank. Thus, both Loan and Pledge Agreements were executed with EURAM Bank concurrently, by Vintage and Tulsi respectively.  4. It was further observed that Vintage had transferred the entire stock of 12,50,000 GDRs issued to it by Tulsi to the India Focus Cardinal Fund, Clariden LEU AG and Investec Zurich. GDRs were subsequently converted into equity shares and sold in the Indian Capital Market. It was also observed that only after Vintage repaid loan in instalments to EURAM Bank, EURAM Bank allowed transfer of GDR issue proceeds from Tulsi\\\\\\\\u2019s account. Based on the above, it was observed that the amount transferred from Tulsi\\\\\\\\u2019s EURAM Bank account was dependent on the repayment of the loan by Vintage, apparently due to the fact that Tulsi had pledged its GDR proceeds to the EURAM Bank against loan advanced by the EURAM Bank to Vintage.  5. It was also observed during investigation that the Board of Directors of Tulsi had passed a resolution dated May 7, 2010, authorizing EURAM Bank to use the GDR proceeds deposited with it as security in connection with loan. On the strength of the said resolution passed by the Board, the Company had entered into the Pledge Agreement with EURAM Bank. Thus, the Pledge Agreement executed by Tulsi has enabled Vintage to avail loan from EURAM Bank for subscribing to the GDR of Tulsi. The bank account in which GDR proceeds were to be deposited, was in the name of the Tulsi but on account of the Pledge Agreement, the GDR proceeds Adjudication Order 6 entities in the matter of Tulsi Extrusions Ltd.,   Page 3 of 33  deposited in the said account were not at the disposal of the Company to utilize for its own needs till such time Vintage repaid the loan to EURAM Bank. 6. On the backdrop of the above stated facts, it was observed that the Company has made selective disclosure to BSE about the outcome of its Board meeting held on May 07, 2010, by only disclosing that the Board has approved the GDR issue to the extent of USD 15 million. The Company had suppressed the information that in the same meeting the Board had also authorized EURAM Bank to use the GDR proceeds as security in connection with loan to be availed if any. The underlying intention behind the said Board Resolution to use the GDR proceeds as security against the loan to be availed by the would be subscriber, i.e. Vintage was never disclosed to the Exchange. Thus, the entire scheme conceived by the Company and its Directors starting from passing of the resolution authorizing the Company to enter into a Pledge Agreement, making partial disclosure to BSE about the GDR issue, making corporate announcement on August 24, 2010 declaring that the GDR were successfully subscribed, to suppression of the above mentioned Pledge and Loan Agreements from the knowledge of the investors, have allegedly resulted in publication of information on the platform of the stock exchanges, in a distorted, misleading and fraudulent manner to the detriment of Public Interest.  7. The Company, the Directors of Tulsi viz., Om Prakash S Jhavar (Noticee 1), Sanjay Taparia (Noticee 2), Gopaldas Maheshwari (Noticee 3), Rajesh B Jhunjhunwala (Noticee 4), Jaiprakash B Kabra (Noticee 5) and Pradip J Mundhra (Noticee 6) who attended the Board Meeting on May 7, 2010 and authorized the Company to sign the Pledge Agreement and the Noticee 6 who executed the Pledge Agreement are alleged to have concealed material information and allowed wrong and misleading information to be disclosed through the Exchange. Therefore, they are alleged to have acted as colluding parties to the above stated scheme contrived to issue GDR in a fraudulent manner. The above acts of concealing and suppressing material facts from the shareholders and the fraudulent arrangement of the Pledge and Loan Agreements by the Noticees to issue GDRs have been alleged to be in violation of provisions of Section 12A (a), (b), (c) of SEBI Act,1992 and Regulations 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 4(1), 4(2)(f), 4(2)(k) and 4(2)(r) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003. Adjudication Order 6 entities in the matter of Tulsi Extrusions Ltd.,   Page 4 of 33  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATION OFFICER  8. Based on the findings of the investigation, SEBI initiated Adjudication proceedings against the Noticees and appointed Shri Jeevan Sonparote as the Adjudicating Officer vide Order dated May 23, 2017 (communicated vide Order dated July 18, 2017) under Section 19 read with Sub-section (1) of Section 15I of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and imposing penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as SEBI Adjudication Rules) to inquire into and adjudge the alleged violations of the provisions of SEBI Act and SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, committed by the Noticees. Pursuant to internal restructuring, the instant proceedings have been transferred to the undersigned vide Order dated September 26, 2019.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING  9. A common Show Cause Notice (SCN) dated October 4, 2017 was issued to the Noticees and to the Company, under Rule 4(1) of the SEBI Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held and penalty be not imposed against them under Section 15 HA of the SEBI Act, for the violations alleged to have been committed by the Noticees as mentioned in the above paragraphs. The Noticees vide letter dated October 24, 2017 authorized the Company to submit the reply on their behalf. Accordingly, on behalf of the Noticees and on it\\\\\\\\u2019s behalf, the Company vide letter dated November 1, 2017 furnished the reply, which is summarized hereunder: a) The Noticees have denied knowledge of the Pledge Agreement and stated that they have come to know about the Pledge Agreement only from the SCN. They have submitted that the \\\\\\\\u2018round seal\\\\\\\\u2019 affixed on the Pledge Agreement does not belong to the Company and the said Pledge Agreement does not bear the common seal of the Company. They have also enclosed copies of some other documents executed by the Company at the relevant time to support their submission that the round seal on the Pledge Agreement is not the seal of the Company. The Noticees have also pointed out to some inconsistencies about the Pledge Agreement in support of their claim that the Pledge Agreement is fake.  b) The Noticees have contended that the Board of the Company has not passed any resolution authorizing the Company to enter into any Pledge Adjudication Order 6 entities in the matter of Tulsi Extrusions Ltd.,   Page 5 of 33  Agreement. With regard to the resolution dated May 7, 2010, they have stated that as part of the banking arrangements entered into by the Company with EURAM Bank, they anticipated availing of certain other facilities from the Bank which required adequate security to be provided to the Bank. Since GDR proceeds were to be deposited with the Bank, it was decided to provide the said bank account as security in case of any loan or facility that were to be availed by the Company from EURAM Bank.  c) They have confirmed that the GDR proceeds of USD 14.325 million were received into the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s account no. 580026 with EURAM Bank however out of the same approx. 8.3 million USD was subsequently repatriated to their account in Jalgaon, Maharashtra. Therefore, the allegation in the SCN that the entire GDR proceeds were diverted to their UAE subsidiary to help Vintage repay their loan is baseless. The Noticees have submitted that the rest of 6 million USD from the GDR proceeds was transferred from EURAM Bank to their subsidiary at UAE to enable it to carry its operation in terms of the GDR Offering Circular wherein it was mentioned that the GDR funds would be used for modernization of machinery, establishment of overseas subsidiary, etc. They have therefore submitted that the GDR proceeds have been utilized in conformity with the objects of the GDR issue as stated in the Offering Circular.  d) The Noticees have stated that the Company as well as its directors have not violated the provisions of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations and SEBI Act. Further, Noticee 1- Omprakash S. Jhavar, Noticee 3 - Gopaldas Maheshwari, Noticee 4 - Rajesh B. Jhunjhunwala and Noticee 6 - Pradip J. Mundhra are stated to have resigned from the Company.  10. It is pertinent to note that for the same set of violations alleged against the Noticees, SCN was also issued to the Company along with the Noticees.  11. In the interest of natural justice and in terms of Rule 4(3) of SEBI Adjudication Rules, the Noticees along with the Company were given an opportunity of personal hearing on October 1, 2020, which was communicated vide Notice dated September 18, 2020. In view of the prevailing circumstances owing to Covid-19 pandemic, the hearing was scheduled through video conferencing on Webex platform on October 1, 2020. The Authorized Representative of the Noticee vide email dated October 1, 2020 inter-alia submitted that Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) has been initiated in respect of the Company under the provisions of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC Code) by an Order No. C.P.(IB)-3171/(MB)/2018 dated December 28, 2018 by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble National Adjudication Order 6 entities in the matter of Tulsi Extrusions Ltd.,   Page 6 of 33  Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai. Further, the Authorized Representative sought adjournment of hearing scheduled on October 1, 2020, which was acceded to and accordingly the hearing was adjourned to October 14, 2020. The Noticees vide letter dated October 12, 2020 authorized its Representative to appear before me for the hearing. The Authorized Representative appeared before me through videoconference on October 14, 2020 and requested to take into the submissions made by the Notices as her oral submissions.

Tulsi Extrusions Ltd., was incorporated on March 22, 1983 in Mumbai and is an integrated manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and formulations. The shares of the Company were listed on BSE and the scrip has been suspended due to penal reasons w.e.f March 31, 2015.   18.

The category wise shareholding pattern of the Company for the quarter ended June 2010 to December 2010  is given below: Particular As on 30.06.10 As on 30.09.10 As on 31.12.10 No. of  shares % No. of  shares % No. of  shares % Promoter Holding 68,84,259 55.10 65,61,961 26.25 63,50,159 25.41 Non Promoter Holding 56,10,841 44.90 91,03,139 36.42 1,85,52,111 74.22 Shares held by custodians & against which Depository Receipts have been issued 0 00.0 93,30,000 37.33 92,830 00.37 Total no. of shares 1,24,95,100 100.00 2,49,95,100 100.00 2,49,95,100 100.00 Adjudication Order 6 entities in the matter of Tulsi Extrusions Ltd.,   Page 9 of 33  20.

The decrease in shareholding was predominantly due to increase in the total no., of shares of the company on account of issuance of GDRs. In absolute terms, number of shares sold by the promoters was 5,34,100 shares for the two quarter i.e., July-December 2010.  21.

Findings on the alleged violation of the provisions of SEBI Act & SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003 by the Noticees   23. The Board of Directors of Tulsi had passed a resolution in its meeting held on May 7, 2010, wherein inter alia, a decision was taken to open an account with EURAM Bank and also to authorize EURAM Bank to use the GDR proceeds as security against loan. Relevant extracts of the Board Resolution are as under:  a)  \\\\\\\\u201cResolved that a bank account be opened with EURAM Bank (the Bank) or any branch of EURAM Bank including the off-shore Branch outside India for the purpose of receiving subscription money in respect of the Global Depository Receipt Issue of the Company\\\\\\\\u201d.  b) \\\\\\\\u201cResolved further that Mr. Pradip J Mundra and Mr. Sanjay R Taparia, Directors of the Company be and are hereby severally authorized to sign, execute, any application, agreement, escrow agreement, document, undertaking, confirmation, declaration and other paper(s) from time to time as may be required by the Bank and to carry and affix common seal of the company thereon, if and when so required.\\\\\\\\u201d Adjudication Order 6 entities in the matter of Tulsi Extrusions Ltd.,   Page 10 of 33   c) \\\\\\\\u201cResolved further that Mr. Pradip J Mundra and Mr. Sanjay R Taparia, Directors of the Company be and are hereby severally authorized to draw cheques and other documents, and to give instructions from time to time as may be necessary to the said EURAM Bank or any branch of EURAM Bank including the off-shore branch, for the purpose of operation of and dealing with the said bank account and carry out other relevant and necessary transactions and generally to take all such steps and to do all such things as may be required from time to time on behalf of this company.\\\\\\\\u201d  d) \\\\\\\\u201cResolved further that the Bank be and is hereby authorized to use the funds so deposited in the aforesaid bank account as security in connection with loans if any as well as to enter into any Escrow agreement or similar agreements if and when so required.\\\\\\\\u201d   24. According to the Noticees, the said resolution never meant to authorize execution of any Pledge Agreement, but to authorize opening of a bank account for the Company. It is however contended by the Noticees that while authorizing the opening of a bank account, they foresaw availing of certain facilities from the Bank in future, hence, thought it fit to provide for the same in the Board resolution so as to use the funds in the bank account as security in case of any loan or facility that were to be availed by the Company. On a perusal of the aforesaid Board Resolution, I note that the said Resolution was approved by the Board on May 7, 2010 for opening of a bank account with EURAM Bank for the purpose of receiving subscription money in respect of the GDR issue of the Company. I note that Pradip J Mundhra (Noticee 6) and Sanjay R. Taparia (Noticee 2), Directors of the Company were authorized to sign, execute any application, agreement, etc., as may be required by the EURAM Bank. Accordingly, the Company has opened an account no. 580026 in its name in EURAM Bank. It was further resolved by the Board to authorize the EURAM Bank with which the account was to be opened to use the funds so deposited in the said bank account as security in connection with loans if any. A comprehensive reading of the said Board resolution indicates that the Company and the Board of Directors had already decided at least as far back as on May 7, 2010 about making a GDR issue and had even decided at that very stage to open a bank account with EURAM Bank for receiving the GDR proceeds. Further, the wording of the resolution also suggests that much before the actual issuance of the proposed GDR, the Company and its Directors had contemplated on the date of passing of the said resolution itself, to use the funds/proceeds of the proposed GDR to be received in their EURAM Bank account as a security for Adjudication Order 6 entities in the matter of Tulsi Extrusions Ltd.,   Page 11 of 33  loans. Such a resolution by the Board involving the future use of the GDR proceeds as a security against a loan indicates that the Company did not intend to utilize the GDR proceeds immediately for the objects for which the GDR were to be issued.   25. I note from the correspondence received from Tulsi that the Company had issued 12,50,000 GDRs (US$ 14.325 million) on August 23, 2010. The GDR proceeds were deposited with EURAM Bank. The summary of the GDR issue by Tulsi as furnished by the Company are tabulated below:  GDR issue date No. of GDRs  issued Capital raised (US$ mn.) Local custodian No. of equity shares underlying GDRs Global Depository Bank Lead Manager Bank where GDR proceeds deposited GDRs listed on 23-08-2010 12,50,000 14.325 DBS Bank, Mumbai 1,25,00,000 (10 shares for each GDR) The Bank of New York Mellon Prospect Capital Limited EURAM Bank, Austria Luxembourg Stock Exchange  26. I note from the records made available to me that Vintage had signed a Loan Agreement No. K110810-001 dated August 11, 2010 with EURAM Bank for availing a loan of 14.325 million US$ so as to subscribe to the full amount of the GDR issue of Tulsi worth of US$ 14.325 million. Towards this end, Vintage had opened an exclusive loan account (a/c no. 540012-043-2 titled as Loan J10080002) with the EURAM Bank for using the loan amount for the exclusive purpose of making subscription to GDR of Tulsi. In this regard some of the relevant clauses of the said Loan Agreement are cited as under  2. Nature and purpose of facility:  To provide funding enabling Vintage FZE to take down GDR issue of 1,250,000 Luxemburg public offering and may only be transferred to EURAM account nr. 580026, Tulsi Extrusions Ltd.,   3.

I also note that on the strength of aforestated authorization given by the Board to \\\\\\\\u201cuse the funds so deposited in the aforesaid bank account as security in connection with loans if any\\\\\\\\u201d, Pradip J. Mundhra had signed a Pledge Agreement with EURAM Bank dated August 11, 2010 and pledged the entire GDR proceeds as security against loan availed by Vintage from EURAM Bank for subscribing to GDR of Tulsi. Some of the relevant clauses of the Pledge Agreement signed by the Company are quoted as under:  1. The preamble  \\\\\\\\u201cBy Loan Agreement K110810-001 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cLoan Agreement\\\\\\\\u201d) dated August 11, 2010, the Bank granted a loan (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cLoan\\\\\\\\u201d) to Vintage FZE, AAH-213, Al Ahamadi House, Jebel Ali Free Trade Zone, Jebel Ali, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (the \\\\\\\\u201cBorrower\\\\\\\\u201d) in the amount of USD 14,325,000.00.

It was observed that these five Noticees contributed 35.47% of total market positive LTP, by putting orders for small quantity i.e. 1-10 shares.   Patch-I (01/04/2014 to 24/07/2014): Exchange-NSE  4.19. It was observed that the price of the scrip at NSE opened at Rs. 11.70 (previous trading day closed at Rs. 11.30), touched a high of Rs. 19.55 and closed at Rs. 12.70.

It was observed that these two Noticees contributed 25.80% of total market positiveFinal Order in the matter of Timbor Home Ltd.  Page 10 of 78  LTP, by putting orders for small quantity i.e. 1-10 shares.  4.22. Thus, the SCN alleges from the trading pattern that these Noticees were not acting as genuine buyers on both NSE and BSE and had no bona fide intention to buy because in-spite of sufficient sell order quantity being available in the market, they bought small quantity of shares in each transaction. By these trades, they were instrumental in establishing a price higher than the last traded price and thus contributed to increased scrip price with most of their trades. In view of the repeated nature of such trades by these two Noticees on NSE (Noticee nos. 3 and 11) and five Noticees on BSE (Noticee nos. 2,3,9,11,and 12), their culpability in increasing the price is established.  Hence it is alleged that these connected entities were acting in concert and contributed to manipulation in the scrip price and created a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip by such trades as explained above.

However, Mr. Soni Sanjay Jethalal failed to provide the requisite information.   4.24. Investigation observed that the following Modus Operandi was adopted by the Noticees: 4.25. It was observed that there was spurt in traded volumes in the scrip soon after the day of circulation of bulk SMS (i.e.25 July, 2014).  4.26. It was observed that there was substantial rise in volumes immediately after circulation of bulk SMS, which could be attributed to the impact of such bulk SMS.  4.27. It was observed that four Noticees who were promoters viz. Shri Anant Sureshchandra Maloo, Maloo building Material Pvt Ltd, Shri Manan Vidhyapati Patel and Abhijeet Dwarkadas Daga had transferred shares directly or indirectly to other connected entities. (Majority of shares were transferred in June and July 2014). In turn, the connected entities sold the aforesaid shares in the market. 4.28.

Prior to sending bulk SMS, connected entities bought small quantity of shares in each transaction which contributed to increase in scrip price.  b.

In the facts and circumstances stated above, it was observed that the Noticees entities devised a scheme and artifice to dump shares on July 25, 2014 onwards, in a pre-planned manner i.e.by sending unsolicited bulk SMS to investors and inducing them to buy the scrip.

In view of the same, it was observed that the said entities had violated the provisions of regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (g) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. It was also observed that Savitri Devi Agarwal manipulated the scrip price by New High Price (NHP) contribution.

I had no intention or purpose to create artificial volume while dealing in scrip of FIRL, as alleged or otherwise. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 I had followed and complied with all the procedure and requirements of the capital market through my broker and stock exchanges. While dealing in shares of FIRL, I have always ensured that it is being done as per rules and regulations which govern capital market. I submit that I have dealt in scrip of FIRL in absolutely fair and transparent manner. I believe that there has been no grievance by any investor, broker, stock exchange or any other agency concerned in the matter.  10. Vide the aforesaid letter, while denying the charges alleged in the SCN, Deepak Gupta also sought certain additional documents. In this connection, Deepak Gupta was informed, vide letter dated March 16, 2020, that all the documents / records referred to and relevant in the SCN have been provided along with SCN. Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT Order in the matter of Shruti Vora Vs SEBI, had decided that \\\\\\\\u201csince the relied upon documents for issuance of SCN have been provided to the Noticee, there is no requirement to furnish all the documents which are in the possession of the A.O., which are not relied upon. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT also opined that the investigation report is not required to be supplied. Further, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT prima facie observed that the only object in making demand of supply of all documents by the Noticee, is to obstruct the proceedings, which does not find any merit and accordingly dismissed the Appeal filed by the Noticee\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, Deepak Gupta was granted an opportunity of hearing on March 26, 2020. However, the said hearing could not be held on the scheduled date.Page 6 of 35  11. Mukat Behari, vide email dated March 2, 2020, represented that he did not receive the SCN and accordingly sought a copy of the same. In view of the same, a copy of the SCN along with the annexures was provided to Mukat Behari vide letter dated March 06, 2020. He was also granted an opportunity of hearing on March 24, 2020, vide the said letter dated March 06, 2020. However, the said hearing could not be held on the scheduled date.  12. Thereafter, vide email dated October 01, 2020, the Noticees were granted an opportunity of hearing on October 13, 2020. However, the said Noticees failed to avail of the said hearing opportunity on October 13, 2020. Thereafter, the Noticees were granted a final opportunity of hearing on October 27, 2020, vide email and letter dated October 14, 2020. I note that Savitri Devi Agarwal and B M Agarwal did not submit any further reply and failed to avail of the hearing opportunity granted to them.  13. Deepak Gupta, vide letter dated October 14, 2020, inter alia made the following submissions in the matter: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 I have no connection or relationship with the alleged suspected entities as mentioned in the SCN or with Natraj Capital and Credit Pvt Ltd. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Merely and solely because l purchased shares of a company in off-market, it cannot be presumed or presupposed that I have a nexus, link or relationship with the said entity. I would like to submit that off market transactions are not illegal per se. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is well-settled law that the taint of \\\\\\\\u2018fraud\\\\\\\\u2019 cannot be attached or charged on preponderance of probability. In fact, compelling evidence should be brought on record for a person/entity to be held liable for 'fraud'.Page 7 of 35  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 I have dealt in shares of Focus within my financial and risk bearing capacity. I had purchased shares of Focus in off-market. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 My transactions in Focus were at the then prevailing market price and I fail to understand as to how my transactions are termed to be \\\\\\\\u2018fraudulent\\\\\\\\u2019 in nature. In my humble opinion, the volume and price of Focus was not affected due to my dealings in the said scrip. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 All the trade and post trade activities were all carried out on the trading cum clearing & settlement mechanism of the exchange. At no point of time I was aware of counterparty with which my transactions got matched. Undisputedly, in case of screen-based trading, the automated system itself matches orders on a price-time priority basis and thus it is not possible for anybody to have access over identity of counter party. Since counter party identity is not displayed; one can never have any choice with whom it wants to deal or not to deal. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 While dealing in shares of Focus, I had followed and complied with all the procedure and requirements as statutorily required. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 I submit that no action has ever been taken against me in past in respect of my dealing in securities market. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 To the best of my knowledge there is no investors\\\\\\\\u2019 complaint on my dealings in Focus shares.  14. On the scheduled dated of hearing on October 27, 2020, Advocate Meit Shah appeared as the Authorised Representative (\\\\\\\\u2018AR\\\\\\\\u2019) on behalf of Deepak Gupta and reiterated the submissions made by Deepak Gupta in his letter dated October 14, 2020.  15. Mukat Behari, vide email dated October 24, 2020, requested to postpone the hearing. In view of the same, Mukat Behari was granted a final opportunity of hearing on November 13, 2020, vide email dated November 05, 2020. Shri Sitaram Agrawal appeared for hearing through the Webex Video Call onPage 8 of 35  November 13, 2020 as the AR of Mukat Behari. During the hearing, the AR made oral submissions in the matter. Further, the AR stated that he will submit written submissions in the matter by November 16, 2020. Thereafter, vide email dated November 13, 2020, the AR inter alia made the following submissions: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the said notice allegation put on my client being indulged in unfair trade practice in not valid as my client have not any managerial financial relation with 245 groups involved in off market and including 74 companies of Natraj group.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 My client purchased 63000 shares of Focus Industrial Resourses Ltd. on 16/07/2002 from NATRAJ CAPITAL & CREDIT PVT. LTD. on open market.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 NATRAJ CAPITAL & CREDIT PVT. LTD. was a private limited company registered with ROC New Delhi. My client have no any direct and indirect relationship with the said company. He had neither directorship nor any shareholding in the said company. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 After holding of shares for 11 years my client availed good opportunity of profit and sold same through brokers M/s.Globe Capital Market Ltd.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Details of sales is as under:- 45000 shares on 28/03/2013 @63/- per shares and 18000 shares @ 58.95 /- per shares and on 03/04/2013 \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is clear from above 2 transactions of sales transaction made by my client not in any planned way (price reduced by 7% just in gap of 4 to 5 days). \\\\\\\\uf0b7 My client is businessmen not involved in any unfair practices, made this investment to avail the chances of profit only.  I would like to draw your attention to the fact that he does not hold any DIN till date so no question arise regarding any involvement in 245 companies mention in the notice .Page 9 of 35  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 My client had made the transaction genuinely.  16. I note that Savitri Devi Agarwal and B M Agarwal did not avail the hearing opportunities granted to them. I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been complied with in the present matter since sufficient opportunities have been provided to the said Noticees to appear for hearing, which they have failed to avail of. In view of the above, I now proceed further in the matter on merits after considering the available records and the submissions made by the Noticees.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 17. I have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticees, their reply and the documents / material available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are : (a) Whether the Noticees have violated regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2(a), (e) and (g) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. (b) Do the violations, if any, attract monetary penalty, as applicable, under Sections 15HA of the SEBI Act?  (c) If so, what would be the quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee after taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act?Page 10 of 35  18. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the PFUTP Regulations as below: Regulation 3: - Prohibition of certain dealings in securities  3. No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014  (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner;  (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange;  (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made thereunder. Regulation 4: - Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities.  (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following, namely:-  (a) indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market;Page 11 of 35  \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. (e) any act or omission amounting to manipulation of the price of a security; \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.. (g)  entering  into  a  transaction  in  securities  without  intention  of  performing  it  or  without intention of change of ownership of such security;..  19. I note that it was alleged in the SCN that Savitri Devi Agarwal, B M Agarwal, Mukat Behari and Deepak Gupta along with connected entities had indulged in creation of artificial volume through transfer of shares via off market transactions and on market sale of the said shares. SEBI observed during investigation that a large number of entities are connected through off market transactions during the investigation period. The off-market transfers and on market sale of the said shares between these entities occurred in a repeated manner and resulted in volume / price manipulation.   20. I note from the available records that the entities were connected on the basis of off market transactions, KYC, MCA details and bank statements. Among the said connected entities, the following groups were observed: (i) Natraj Group: It was observed that Natraj Capital & Credit Pvt Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u2018Natraj\\\\\\\\u2019) had transferred shares in off market to 72 entities and received shares from 2 entities. There was one entity which was common. Therefore, in total Natraj entered into off market transactions with 73 entities. This forms a group of 74Page 12 of 35  entities including Natraj. All the group entities have traded on market during the IP.  (ii) Parmanand Yadav Group: It was observed that Parmanand Yadav (Prop. of M/s. Roxtech Services) had transferred shares in off market to 128 entities and received shares from 9 entities. There was one entity which was common. Therefore, in total Parmanand Yadav entered into off market transactions with 136 entities. This forms a group of 137 entities including Parmanand Yadav. Out of these 137 entities, 131 entities have traded on market during the IP.  (iii) Connection between Natraj Group and Parmanand Yadav Group:  One entity viz., Prem Chand had transferred shares in off market to Parmanand Yadav as well as Placido Marketing Private Limited, which is a Natraj Group entity. Prem Chand has been included in the list of 137 entities of Parmanand Yadav Group. (iv) Connection with promoters: There were 6 promoter entities who were involved in off market transactions during the IP. Further, 5 of those promoters have entered into off market transactions with Natraj group entities. Only two of the above promoters have traded during the IP. (v) Other entities:  Additionally, there were 28 entities who were involved in off market transactions with above group entities or with the entities who had off market transactions with group entities. Out of 28 entities, 26 entities had traded during the IP.Page 13 of 35  (vi) Other connections:  6 promoter entities and Pawansut Holdings Limited (Pradeep Kumar Jindal is the common director in Pawansut Holdings Limited and the company) also have traded in the scrip.   21. In view of the above, I note that the details of the connected entities are as below: Table 1 S. No. Particulars No. of entities involved in off market No. of entities traded in the market 1.  Natraj group 74 74 2.  Parmanand Yadav group 137 131 3.  Promoter Group 6 2 4.  Other entities on the basis of off market transfers 28 26 5.  Entities connected to promoters and traded in the secondary market.  NA 7 6.  Total number of entities 245 240   22. I note from the investigation report that the following inter-se relationship among the Noticees was also observed on the basis of Off market transfers: Table 2 S. No. PAN Name Connection details Group 1 ABXPA3339G B M AGARWAL Off market transactions with Natraj Natraj group 2 AGDPG4480D DEEPAK  GUPTA Off market transactions with Natraj Natraj group 3 AFOPB5611H MUKAT BEHARI Off market transactions with Natraj Natraj group 4 AAKPA5197L SAVITRI DEVI AGARWAL Off market transactions with Natraj Natraj group  23. I note from the replies of the Noticees that they have inter alia stated that they had no connection with the counterparty of their off-market transactions. In this regard, I note that that in an off-market transfer, the buyer buys from a specific seller and not just place an order with the broker for an online trade. I note that in the case of off-market transfer of shares, only when the buyer and seller arePage 14 of 35  known to each other and the buyer knows about the holding of such shares by the seller, they can negotiate the price and quantity of shares. In view of the above, I note that it can be reasonably concluded that these counterparties in the off-market transfers knew each other and thus, are connected to each other through off-market transfers.  24. In view of the above and the fact that the off-market transactions were done is an admitted position, I conclude that the said off-market transactions are established connections and thereby the Noticees thus connected are treated as working in unison. TRADING BY CONNECTED ENTITIES:  25. I note from the investigation report that the market volume during the IP in the scrip of FIRL was 1,12,93,300 shares and there were 236 buyers and 536 sellers. Out of this, 28 connected entities bought 97,89,029 shares (86.68% of the market volume) and 221 connected entities sold 85,83,558 shares (76.01% to the market volume). The trading of the connected entities who contributed to more than 1% of buy volume/sell volume to the market is given below: Buy side:  Table 3 S.No. Pan No Name of the connected entity Buy Qty % of buy to the market buy  Weighted Average buy price (Rs.) 1.

From the above tables, I observe that on the buy side, 15 connected entities contributed to more than 1% of market volume and their total contribution to market was 83.85%. On sell side, 10 connected entities contributed to more than 1% of market volume and their total contribution to market was 25.50%. I furtherPage 16 of 35  note that out of 85,83,558 shares sold by connected entities 78,21,347 shares were bought by connected entities only. Therefore, I note that the trading volume in the scrip was majorly through the trading by connected entities among themselves.   VOLUME CREATION BY CONNECTED ENTITIES THROUGH OFF MARKET AND ON MARKET TRANSACTIONS: 27. When the shares transferred to counter party come back to the transferor, there is no change of ownership of the security and this creates artificial volume in the market. During the IP, from the analysis of off market transactions and trading in the scrip, it was observed that the connected entities in total created artificial volume of 54,56,292 shares, i.e., 48.31% to the market volume. In this respect, I note that Natraj Capital & Credit Pvt. Ltd. had transferred shares in off market to various entities including Savitri Devi Agarwal, B M Agarwal, Mukat Behari & Deepak Gupta and purchased those shares on market from them either directly or through entities connected to it. This created artificial volume in the scrip as there is no change of ownership due to transactions by Natraj Capital & Credit Pvt Ltd. and its connected entities. I note that Natraj Capital & Credit Pvt. Ltd. had transferred 29,59,900 shares to 72 entities in off market during the IP.

The details are as follows:Page 4 of 72   \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Company vide four separate agreements dated March 28,1994, leased the 4 duplex flats in the building, JK House, to Pashmina, for a period of 9 years at the rate of Rs. 6000 per duplex flat, per month. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Pashima, sub-leased the 4 dulpex flats at the rate of Rs. 7500 per month for each duplex flat, commencing from April 04, 1994. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Subsequently, by and under another Deed of Lease dated March 27, 2003 executed by the Company in favour of Pashmina, the company granted a lease in respect of the four duplex flats in favour of Pashmina, for a term of 9 years from March 27, 2003, for the monthly rent of Rs. 6000 per duplex flat. This lease was due to expire on March 26, 2012. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Pashmina, Sub-leased the 4 duplex flats at the rate of Rs. 7500 per month for each duplex flat, commencing from March 27, 2003 for a term equivalent to the term created by the original lease dated March 27, 2003. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Subsequently, JK House was under reconstruction and the sub-tenants were provided alternate accommodation. The details of the expenditure incurred by providing alternate accommodation to the sub-tenants are as follows: Sr. No Name of the Sub-Tenant Amount of Expenses incurred (in Rs. Crore) Time Period 1 Shri Gautam HarLSinghania 19.74 May 2007 to Nov 2015 2 Smt Veena Devi Singhania and Shri Anant Singhania 10.64 May 2007 to Nov 2015 3 Shri Akashaypat Singhania 10.57 May 2007 to Nov 2015  Total 40.95  However, during these years, the sub-tenants were paying a sum of Rs. 7500 per month per sub-tenant. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Also, the total cost incurred by the Company, as informed by the Company vide letter dated June 12, 2017, for the reconstruction of JK House, a year wisePage 5 of 72   break-up of the cost incurred by the Company from 2008 onwards are as follows: Year Cost Incurred (Rs. In Crore) 2008-09 22.85 2009-10 15.48 2010-11 30.06 2011-12 31.64 2012-13 33.21 2013-14 20.16 2014-15 11.11 2015-16 22.17 2016-17 83.60 Total 270.28 \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In terms of Clause 3 of the Tripartite agreement: \\\\\\\\u201cIn consideration of the Sub-Lessor and the Tenant surrendering their tenancy and sub-tenancy rights including all their other rights, title and interest, if any, in the said existing premises and also in consideration of their handing over possession of the said existing premises, the Developer has agreed to provide the tenant, at its cost, alternate accommodation of a commensurate size at a comparable location, until expiry of one year from the date of handing over the Apartment to the tenant for undertaking interior decoration. -\\\\\\\\u2014\\\\\\\\u201d Related Party Transactions: It is noted that the sub-tenants were paying a paltry sum of Rs. 7,500 per month per sub-tenants as rent whereas, expenditure incurred by the Company for providing alternate accommodation to each of the sub-tenants was Rs. 8 lakh per month. Further in FY 2015-16, rent paid by sub-tenants remained same but expenditure incurred by the Company for providing alternate accommodation to each of the sub-tenants increased to Rs. 12 lakhs per month.Page 6 of 72   ii. Thus, it is alleged that the Company provided alternate accommodation to sub-tenants at approximately 99% discount. Such disparity in rent paid by sub tenants and the company indicates that intent of the tripartite agreement was to provide unfair economic benefit to promoters at the cost of company and its shareholders funds. iii. In terms of Regulation 23(2) of the LODR Regulations, \"All related party transactions shall require prior approval of the audit committee\\\\\\\\u201d. In this regard, the Company vide letter dated June 06, 2017 has submitted that \\\\\\\\u201cno approval of Audit committee was required as payment with respect to alternate accommodation were made directly to the licensors, being unrelated third parties (under relevant leave license agreements), who were and are in (no) way related parties (as defined under Companies Act, 2013)\\\\\\\\u201d. iv. Since, there is no dispute that tripartite agreement is a deemed related party transaction, thus any payment arising out of tripartite agreement should also be considered as a related party transaction. Therefore, audit committee approval was required for payment made pursuant to tripartite agreement from December 01, 2015 under LODR Regulations. Thus, it is alleged that the Company has violated Regulation 23(2) of Listing Regulations and Clause 49 (VII)(D) of the SEBI Circular dated April 17, 2014. Litigation filed by related party: v. It was alleged that the Company has failed to notify the litigation filed against the Company by Sub-Tenant. vi. In this regard, it is pertinent to refer to Clause 3 and Clause 6 of the tri-partite agreement:Page 7 of 72   Clause 3: \\\\\\\\u201c--------. The developer further agrees that upon completion of the new structure on the said property, the developer shall offer to sell to the tenant, the apartment which will be more or less of the same carpet area as the said existing premises in the new structure at the rate as specified in Clause 6 herein and in the manner and on the terms and conditions as hereinafter provided\\\\\\\\u2019. Clause 6: \\\\\\\\u201cIn pursuance of Clause 3 of this agreement, the Developer agrees to offer for sale to the Tenant, the Apartment which will be more or less of the same carpet area as the said existing premises, in the new structure not later than 30 days from completion of the structure, at the rate of Rs. 9,000 per square foot (carpet), subject to the Tenant having handed over timely, vacant and peaceful possession of the said existing premises to the Developer\\\\\\\\u201d. vii. It is noted that subsequent to redevelopment of JK House, the Sub-Lessees have sent letters to Company to exercise their option of purchase of the new apartments as per the said Tripartite Agreement. Subsequently, the sub-lessees have filed a Petition before the Bombay High Court in the matter. viii. It was alleged that the pending litigation against the Company is material in terms of the Regulation 30 read with Schedule III of LODR Regulation, 2015, which requires to be disclosed to the Stock Exchanges. In terms of Regulation 30 of LODR Regulations, 2015, \\\\\\\\u201cthe listed entity shall frame a policy for determination of materiality, based on criteria specified in this sub-regulations, duly approved by its board of directors, which shall be disclosed on its website\". ix. It is also observed that the Company has made \\\\\\\\u201cPolicy on Determination of Materiality of Event(s) I Information\\\\\\\\u201d, wherein it has defined the event/information shall be considered to be material, which are as follows:Page 8 of 72   I. Qualitative: Qualitative criteria to determine materiality shall become applicable to an event/information if: II. Quantitative: Quantitative criteria to determine materiality shall become applicable to an event/information if: a. Where the value involved or the impact exceeds 5% of the gross turnover or revenue or total income; or exceeds 20% of the net worth (lower threshold shall be taken as a trigger); b. The above threshold shall be determined on the basis of audited consolidated financial statements of last audited financial year. x. It is alleged that, if the said 4 duplex apartments in JK House were sold to sub-tenants as per the terms and conditions laid down in the Tripartite Agreement, then it would have resulted in opportunity cost of over Rs. 623 crore to the Company and its shareholders. The calculation of opportunity cost is as follows: Particulars Constructed Area (Sq.Ft.) Rate (Rs. Per sq.ft.) Total Value (in Rs. Crores) Commercial Space 19,493.68 1,17,000 228 Residential Space 68,661.39 1,17,000 803 Other saleable amenities and service space (rate will be one third of Residential rates) 1,56,746.62 39,000 611 Total 2,44,901.69  1,643 (Source: JLL Valuation report, forwarded by the Company vide letter dated June 02, 2017) Cost incurred in redeveloping JK House (in Rs.

It is noted from the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended March 31,2016, the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s Gross Revenue from Operations for the FY 2015-16 (Consolidated) was Rs. 5,63,247.82 Lakhs. xii. In terms of the Policy on Materiality determined by the Company, 5% of gross turnover of last audited consolidated financial statements i.e. FY 2015-16 is Rs. 281.64 crores. Since the estimated cost i.e. Rs. 623 crore exceeds 5% of the gross turnover, it is alleged that the Company should have notified the stock exchanges upon receipt of litigation filed by sub-tenant along with the expected financial implications. Accordingly, it is alleged that the Company have violated Regulation 30(1), 30(3), 30(4) and 30(6) read with clause (8) of para B of Part A of Schedule III of Listing Regulations, 2015 and clause (8) of Para B of Annexure I of SEBI Circular CIR/CFD/CMD/4/2015 dated September 09, 2015 and Regulation 4(1) (a), (b), (c), (d), (h), (j) of the Listing Regulations, 2015. Reclassification of Shareholding pattern xiii. It is observed from the shareholding pattern for quarter ended March 2017, Ritwik A Ruia, held 2000 shares of the Company under the category \\\\\\\\u2018Promoter and Promoter Group\\\\\\\\u2019. For the quarter ended June 2017, Ritwik A Ruia was not reflected as part of the Promoter and Promoter Group of the Company however, vide letterPage 10 of 72   dated September 07, 2017, Company in its reply has confirmed that \"Ritwik Ruia continues to be part of Promoter and Promoter Group of the Company\\\\\\\\u201d. It was also observed that the Company has subsequently modified the holdings of the \\\\\\\\u2018Promoter and Promoter Group\\\\\\\\u2019 for the quarter ended June 2017, by including Ritwik Ruia as part of the promoters and was holding Nil shares of the Company. xiv. Thus, it is alleged that the Company has not followed any procedures specified under Regulation 31A of Listing Regulations, 2015 for reclassification of promoter to public shareholders and accordingly filed an incorrect information with stock exchange. Thus, it was alleged that the Company had violated Regulation 31A of the Listing Regulations, 2015. 7. I note that the SCN had returned undelivered from the address of the Noticee. Thereafter, the SCN was hand delivered to the authorized representative of the Noticee on December 03, 2018. Subsequently, the Noticee, vide letter dated January 08, 2019, requested for inspection of documents. Vide letter dated January 22, 2019, the erstwhile AO rejected the said request and informed the Noticee that all relevant and relied upon documents have already been provided to it. Further, the erstwhile AO gave another opportunity to the Noticee to submit its reply to the SCN on or before February 05, 2019. Subsequently, vide Email dated February 27, 2019, the Noticee submitted that it had filed for settlement of the adjudication proceedings in terms of SEBI (Settlement of Proceedings) Regulations, 2018.  8. Subsequently, upon transfer of the said matter to the undersigned, vide Email dated March 04, 2020, the concerned department of SEBI informed that the said settlement application of the Noticee had been rejected. Subsequently, videPage 11 of 72   letter dated March 09, 2020, certain clarification in respect of the SCN were provided to the Noticee. Further, the Noticee was provided with an opportunity of personal hearing on March 30, 2020 and the Noticee was also provided with an opportunity to submit its reply at least 2 days before the date of hearing. Vide Email dated March 26, 2020, the Noticee requested for adjournment of personal hearing on account of COVID-19 and the consequent lockdown of the country order by the Government of India.  9. Thereafter, vide letter dated April 24, 2020, the Noticee was advised to submit its reply to the SCN, if any, on or before May 11, 2020. An opportunity of personal hearing was also provided to the Noticee on May 15, 2020. Vide letter dated May 11, 2020, the Noticee requested for two weeks\\\\\\\\u2019 time to submit its reply in light of extension of lockdown due to COVID-19. Thereafter, vide letter dated May 22, 2020, the Noticee submitted its reply to the SCN wherein the Noticee made the following contentions: a. The charges in the SCN against the Noticee are as follows: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 alleged failure to take approval in case of existing related party transaction in connection with payment for alternate accommodation provided to sub-tenants, namely, Mr. Gautam Singhania, Mr. Akshaypat Singhania and Ms. Veena Devi Singhania during the period of redevelopment of JK House (financial year 2014 till date) under: (i) Regulation 23(2) of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (\\\\\\\\u201cListing Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d); and (ii) Clause 49 (VII)(D) of the erstwhile listing agreement (amendments introduced vide Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) circular dated April 17, 2014). \\\\\\\\uf0b7 alleged failure to disclose the litigation filed by Mr. Akshaypat Singhania, Ms. Veenadevi Singhania and Mr. Anant Singhania in January 2017, along withPage 12 of 72   brief details of litigation and expected financial implications under: (i) Regulations 30(1), 30(3), 30(4) and 30(6) of the Listing Regulations read with Clause (8) of para B of Part A of Schedule III of Listing Regulations and Clause (8) of part B of Annexure I of SEBI circular dated September 9, 2015, bearing reference no. CIR/CFD/CMD/4/2015; and (ii) Regulation 4(1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (h), (j) of Listing Regulations; and \\\\\\\\uf0b7 alleged failure to follow the due process for reclassification of Mr. Ritwik A. Ruia from promoter to public shareholder in June 2017, under Regulation 31A of the Listing Regulations. Inspection b. On January 22, 2019, SEBI issued a letter to the Noticee stating that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s request for inspection of all documents/ material referred to and/or relied upon and/or available in connection with, or in relation to the charges against the Noticee in the SCN, was denied and that no other documents or information other than which has been provided by SEBI had been relied upon. c. On January 31, 2019, the Noticee replied to the above letter, inter alia, stating that the Noticee will not be able to comprehensively deal with each and every allegation levied against the Noticee in the SCN, without an inspection of documents and material relied upon and referred to by SEBI when issuing the SCN. An inspection is essential for arriving at a fair adjudication of the SCN and the responses submitted by the Noticee. A simpliciter rejection on the ground of the request being \\\\\\\\u201cvague and roving in nature\\\\\\\\u201d vitiates the fundamental principles of natural justice and due process of law. Further, on April 4, 2019, the Noticee once again requested grant of inspection of documents and material in relation to the SCN. Till date the Noticee has not received any response from SEBI in relation to the above requests. d. It is submitted that on the bare reading of the SCN, there is no specific evidence pressed into action against the Company. The SCN is primarily based on the information provided by the Company and it appears that SEBI has not carried out its own independent investigation and/ or examination before issuing the SCN. The allegations in the SCN are vague and are not supported by facts and evidence. We are not in a position to determine whether SEBI has indeed found any concrete evidence in support of the general findings.Page 13 of 72   e. Further, the SCN does not bring out as to what advantage/ benefit was gained by the Company by committing the alleged breaches and defaults, which in any case, the Company denies having committed. It is submitted that the allegations in SCN are general, vague and unsupported by any facts and evidence. From the bare reading of the SCN, it appears that the allegations against the Company are baseless, lack merit and are liable to be set aside. Accordingly, it is submitted SCN is vague, lacking in material particulars, unintelligible and is merely based on surmises and conjectures, and hence violative of the principles of natural justice. Especially in these circumstances, an inspection is of paramount importance. f. It is submitted that all material collected by SEBI during its investigation ought to have been made available to the Noticee and unless the same is done Noticee will not be able to even discover material/ evidence that may have been collected by SEBI during investigation which may support its case. It is submitted that it is a well settled position in law that an adverse inference can be drawn only if a party withholds certain evidence and not merely on account of its failure or inability to obtain certain evidence. g. In the absence of a complete inspection being provided to the Noticee and in light of the absence of records available with the Noticee prejudice is being caused to the Noticee to effectively defend itself on the charges levelled against it in the present proceedings and therefore the principles of natural justice are being grossly violated. h. Further, without prejudice to our right to seek the inspection of documents/ material and/ or cross examination of persons in connection with the SCN, we, on behalf of the Company, hereby submit the following response for your consideration. Allegation relating failure to take approval for a related party transaction i. It is submitted that the Company entered into a single deed of lease on March 28, 1994 with Pashmina Holdings Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cPashmina\\\\\\\\u201d) pursuant to which the Company granted a lease of four duplex flats situated in JK House to Pashmina for a period of nine years for each duplex flat. Pashmina, sub-leased the said four duplex flats to the following tenants (collectively \\\\\\\\u201cSub-Tenants\\\\\\\\u201d): \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Mr. Gautam Singhania; \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Dr. Vijaypat Singhania; \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Mrs. Veenadevi Singhania and Mr. Anant Singhania; andPage 14 of 72   \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Mr. Akshaypat Singhania. j. Subsequently, pursuant to another deed of lease dated March 27, 2003 between the Company and Pashmina, the Company granted lease of the said four duplex flats to Pashmina for a term of nine years commencing from March 27, 2003 for each duplex flat. Pashmina had sub-leased the said four duplex flats to the Sub-Tenants. k. Given the condition of the JK House and based on: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 the structural audit report dated March 25, 2004 issued by Sterling Engineering Consultancy Services Private Limited which, inter alia, reported problems of corrosion and weakening;  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 certificate from the Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay which, inter alia, reported corrosion, seepage, poor quality control at the time of construction and that JK House was in an extremely weak state; and \\\\\\\\uf0b7 letter dated March 23, 2006 received from Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai which, inter alia, reported that JK House is unsafe and should be demolished, the Company resolved to demolish and reconstruct JK House. l. Thereafter, the Company and Pashmina had entered into four agreements each dated November 6, 2007 (\\\\\\\\u201cTripartite Agreements\\\\\\\\u201d), with the Sub-Tenants. m. In terms of the Tripartite Agreements, the Company, inter alia, offered to provide the Sub-Tenants with temporary alternate premise of a commensurate size at a comparable location during the period of reconstruction or redevelopment of property (being JK House), in consideration of the Sub-Tenants surrendering/ transferring their rights and possession in respect of the existing premise in favour of the Company. The cost incurred by the Company for providing alternate accommodation to: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Mr. Gautam Singhania was Rs. 8,00,000 which subsequently augmented to Rs. 12,00,000 in financial year 2015-16; \\\\\\\\uf0b7 A similar escalation in rent was also seen in the case of: (A) Mr. Akshaypat Singhania, and (B) Ms. Veenadevi Singhania and Mr. Anant Singhania; \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the case of Dr. Vijaypat Singhania, no expenses were incurred as the Company had not paid for Dr. Vijaypat Singhania\\\\\\\\u2019s alternate accommodationPage 15 of 72   till July 2018. However, pursuant to litigation in the family, pursuant to an order dated July 14, 2018 of the Arbitral Tribunal in the Arbitration Proceedings between Dr. Vijaypat Singhania and the Company, the Company has been paying towards Dr. Vijaypat Singhania\\\\\\\\u2019s alternate accommodation since August 2018. n. It is submitted that the cost incurred by the Company in providing alternate accommodation to the Sub-Tenants, was as per the prevailing tenancy rent, and also in line with the provisions of the Tripartite Agreements. It is submitted that the requisite approvals were sought for entering into Tripartite Agreements for entering into the Tripartite Agreement and/ or exercising options arising out of the same, as and when required. o. Further, given that the shareholders of the Company in the annual general meeting of the company held on June 5, 2017 resolved to reject the proposed transaction as was contemplated under the Tripartite Agreements, there no longer existed any deal/ transaction, and hence any scope for a proposition that such deal/ transaction is unfair was brought to an end. Additionally, it is submitted that the payments with respect to alternate accommodation (that was provided to the Sub-Tenants except Dr. Vijaypat Singhania) have been made by the Company directly to the licensors, under the relevant leave and license agreements). These licensors not being \\\\\\\\u2018related parties\\\\\\\\u2019 (as defined under the Companies Act, 2013 (\\\\\\\\u201cCA 2013\\\\\\\\u201d)) to the Company, it was bona fide believed that there was no need for any procedural compliance relating to related party transactions. Therefore, the procedures involving the Audit Committee were not followed since they were not applicable. p. Without prejudiced to the aforesaid, it is submitted that such payments were started in 2006-07, i.e. well before the Listing Regulations were notified. It is settled law that no requirement under law can be applied retrospectively and that all application must only be made prospectively. Therefore, Regulation 23(2) of the Listing Regulations is to be read and applied prospectively. Consequently, there is also no case to be made for taking any retrospective approval for these payments that had already been made and contracted even before the Listing Regulations became law.Page 16 of 72   q. In fact, it is submitted that the provisions under Regulation 23(6) of the Listing Regulations positively states that the provisions under the Regulation 23 of the Listing Regulations (which deals with the related party transactions) shall be applicable to all prospective transactions. It is trite principle of law that a penal statute which creates new offences is always prospective with only two exceptions, i.e. (a) any retrospective application must be expressly so stipulated in the enactment; or (b) inference of retrospective application should become evident by necessary implication. r. Further, it is respectfully submitted that the Company vide its letters dated July 26, 2017, August 14, 2017, August 21, 2017 and September 7, 2017 had drawn the attention of SEBI to this vital principle of law. s. The SCN has not taken the same into consideration, and has simply alleged that the Company has failed to take approval in relation to the money paid by the Company for alternate accommodation. t. In view of the aforesaid context, it is submitted that: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In terms of the Companies Act, 1956 (\\\\\\\\u201cCA 1956\\\\\\\\u201d) and the then prevailing Listing Agreement, a resolution of board of directors was passed at meetings held on June 23, 2006 and July 20, 2007 and Mr. Gautam Singhania being interested on the matter, abstained from voting on the matter.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 With effect from May 1, 2017, the Company stopped paying any rent for the alternate accommodation of Mr. Gautam Singhania. However, the Company has to continue to pay for the alternate accommodation for Mr. Akshaypat Singhania, Mrs. Veenadevi Singhania along with Mr. Anant Singhania in compliance with the order passed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Bombay High Court, which inter alia directed the Company that till further orders, the Company is required to continue the leave and license agreement for the premise occupied by the said sub-tenants. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The payments with respect to alternate accommodation were made by the Company directly to the licensor who were in no way \\\\\\\\u201crelated parties\\\\\\\\u201d (as defined under CA 2013) to the Company.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 While the Company was not required to place the matters set out above before the audit committee, based on SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s request dated July 5, 2017, and keepingPage 17 of 72   in mind the highest standard of corporate governance, the Company placed the matters before the audit committee on July 25, 2017, and the view of the members of the audit committee were concurrent with the responses set out above.  u. SEBI has alleged that the Company has violated provisions under: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Regulation 23(2) of Listing Regulations, which was notified on September 2, 2015; and \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Clause 49 (VII)(D) of the Listing Agreement, which as has been stated in the SCN was introduced vide SEBI circular dated April 17, 2014. It is pertinent to note that the Tripartite Agreements were executed much prior to the Listing Regulations and the amended Clause 49 (VII)(D) being introduced. Therefore, it is respectfully submitted that the provisions of Listing Regulations and the amended Clause 49(VII)(D) should be read and applied prospectively and therefore, no retrospective approval was required to be taken for the alternate accommodation payments under the Listing Regulations. In fact, it is submitted that the provisions under Regulation 23(6) of the Listing Regulations states that the provisions under the Regulation 23 of the Listing Regulations (which deals with the related party transactions) shall be applicable to all prospective transactions. v. As stated above, the Company obtained the requisite approvals from its audit committee, board of directors and/ or shareholders, as required, for the related party transactions entered into by it, and made the relevant disclosures required to be made, from time to time. It is further submitted that: Execution of the Tripartite Agreements \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In terms of Section 293(1)(a) of CA 1956 (applicable at the time the agreements recording the termination of tenancy rights in order for JK House to be redeveloped), the board of directors of a public company could not, except with the consent of such public company in general meeting, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole, or substantially the whole, of the undertaking of the company. The expression \\\\\\\\u2018undertaking\\\\\\\\u2019 has been defined as the following:Page 18 of 72   (i) The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India, AIR 1970 SC 564, held that an \\\\\\\\u2018undertaking\\\\\\\\u2019 means a business unit or enterprise in which a company may be engaged as gainful occupation.

Metis Marketing Services Ltd., Corporate Agent \\\\\\\\n[Based on reply dated 27th May 2020, to the Show-Cause Notice dated 20th May \\\\\\\\n2020 and submissions made during Hearing through Video Conference held at \\\\\\\\n2:45 pm on 18th August, 2020, chaired by Mr. K. Ganesh, Member (Life), at the \\\\\\\\noffice of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, Financial \\\\\\\\nDistrict, Nanakramguda, Hyderabad]. \\\\\\\\nBackground: -\\\\\\\\n1. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (hereinafter referred to \\\\\\\\nas \"Authority\") had conducted an onsite inspection during 18th to 22nd June, 2018, an \\\\\\\\nonsite inspection of M/s. Metis Marketing Services Ltd, Corporate Agent (hereinafter \\\\\\\\nreferred to as \"CA\" or \"Company\") in order to examine overall regulatory compliance by \\\\\\\\nthe CA. \\\\\\\\n2. The Authority forwarded a copy of the Inspection Report to the CA on 16th August, \\\\\\\\n2018 seeking their comments and the CA's response was received vide their letter dated \\\\\\\\n20th September, 2018. Upon examining the documents on hand and submissions made \\\\\\\\nby the CA, the Authority issued Show Cause Notice (hereinafter referred to as \"SCN\") on \\\\\\\\n20th May, 2020. The CA replied the SCN vide their letter dated 27th May, 2020 and they \\\\\\\\nsought for personal hearing. Accordingly, the hearing was granted to the CA and the \\\\\\\\nsame was held through Video conference on 18th August, 2020. Mr. Sandeep Saini, \\\\\\\\nPrincipal Officer, Mr. Sanjeev Pandey, Shareholder and Ex-Principal officer, attended \\\\\\\\nthe hearing, on behalf of the CA. On behalf of the Authority, Mr. TS Naik, GM (Agency \\\\\\\\nDistribution), Shri Prabhat Kumar Maiti, GM (Enforcement) and Shri B. Raghavan, DGM \\\\\\\\n(Enforcement), attended the hearing. \\\\\\\\n3. The submissions made by the CA \\\\\\\\nin their written reply to the Show Cause Notice \\\\\\\\nand those made during the course of the personal hearing and the documents submitted \\\\\\\\nby the CA in evidence of their submissions have been considered by the Authority \\\\\\\\nand accordingly the decisions of the Authority on the charges are detailed below. \\\\\\\\nCharges, Submissions in reply thereof and Decisions: \\\\\\\\n4. Charge No. 1 \\\\\\\\nUpon examination of premium register many policies were observed wherein \\\\\\\\ncommission received was in excess of the regulatory limits, against the spirit of \\\\\\\\nRegulation 18(1) of IRDAI (Registration of Corporate Agents) Regulations, 2015. \\\\\\\\nThe CA, rather than justifying how the submitted data is in compliance of the regulation, \\\\\\\\npreferred to share an e-mail from the Insurer. This implies that the CA is not aware of \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ t~eir level of compliance to the regulatory provision applicable to them. \\\\\\\\n,jb \\\\\\\\n\"ifcf;t_ 115/1, ~~. \\\\\\\\n(J) : +91-40-2020 4000 ~ \\\\\\\\n: www.irdai.gov.in \\\\\\\\n(J) : +91-40-2020 4000 Website : www.irdai.gov.in\\\\\\\\n5 \\\\\\\\nSubmission of CA: \\\\\\\\nThe CA submitted that they are in compliance of the stated regulations and have in \\\\\\\\nsupport shared the e-mail as received from the insurer in question. The CA further \\\\\\\\nsubmitted that as a responsible corporate agent they approached the insurer to guide \\\\\\\\nsuitably on the issue, then to endeavour to explain and justify the brokerage as received \\\\\\\\nfrom the insurance company. The respective insurance company has categorically \\\\\\\\nmentioned that prescribed rate of commission has been paid to the CA and no excess \\\\\\\\ncommission has been paid. \\\\\\\\nThe CA understands fully the level of compliance to the regulatory provIsIons as \\\\\\\\napplicable to them. The CA has submitted that the they are a small sized corporate \\\\\\\\nagency and depend a lot on the expertise available at the level of insurance companies \\\\\\\\nwith whom they have arrangements for solicitation of business. \\\\\\\\nIn view of the foregoing they \\\\\\\\nexplained that they have not disobeyed the regulatory \\\\\\\\nprovisions in the process of payment of remuneration to the corporate agency by any of \\\\\\\\nthe arranged insurance companies hence the averment is not applicable on them. \\\\\\\\nOn the above basis, the CA requested for sympathetic consideration of their submission \\\\\\\\nas no material prejudice to their customers and IRDAI regulations have been caused. \\\\\\\\nThe CA further requested that based on the perception of the two insurance companies \\\\\\\\nno cause of action has arisen and no customer has been put to any disadvantage. Also \\\\\\\\nno adverse effect has taken place in any part of the ecosystem the CA observes. \\\\\\\\nThe CA prays that charge under Regulation 18(1) of IRDAI (Registration of Corporate \\\\\\\\nAgents) Regulation 2015 may not be applied in this case. \\\\\\\\n6 Submission during personal hearing: \\\\\\\\nThe CA submitted that they cross checked their data with the data of the insurers. And \\\\\\\\non that basis, the CA claims that it had received only as much commission/remuneration \\\\\\\\nas is allowed under the law. \\\\\\\\nThe CA has further submitted that while cross verifying, \\\\\\\\nthey noticed that there was some clerical error in the data and the CA submits that it is \\\\\\\\nconfirmed by the insurers that they did not pay anything more than what is allowed \\\\\\\\nunder the regulations/guidelines. \\\\\\\\n7 \\\\\\\\nSubmissions post hearing: \\\\\\\\nThe CA has sent an email communication to the Authority attaching therewith a letter \\\\\\\\nsubmitting that they did not receive any amount in excess of the limit prescribed in the \\\\\\\\nRegulations and that a minor variation noticed by the inspection team was on account of \\\\\\\\nclerical error and mistake on the CA's side while collating the data for furnishing to the \\\\\\\\nInspection team. \\\\\\\\n8 \\\\\\\\nDecision: \\\\\\\\nIt is to be mentioned that the CA earlier did not speak about the clerical error in the data. \\\\\\\\nIn fact, in response to the SCN also, the CA has attempted to justify the receipt of the \\\\\\\\namount of commission by taking reference to a communication from the insurer. \\\\\\\\nStill, \\\\\\\\nc\\\\\\\\n~ote of the CA's submission, the charge is not pressed. \\\\\\\\nThe CA is advised to \\\\\\\\n'2-/L\\\\\\\\nmaintain the records accurately so as to ensure that the \\\\\\\\ncommission/remuneration \\\\\\\\nreceived by them does not exceed the limit prescribed. \\\\\\\\n9 Charge No.2 \\\\\\\\nViolation of clause 3(ii)(a) and clause 3(ii)(m) of schedule Ill reads in conjunction \\\\\\\\nwith regulation 26 of IRDAI (Registration of Corporate Agents) Regulations, 2015 \\\\\\\\n(a) \\\\\\\\nThe corporate agent had made payments other than salary to employees, SPs \\\\\\\\nand also to individuals other than employees under section code 194J-'Fees for \\\\\\\\nprofessional or Technical Services'. Further, \\\\\\\\nupon scrutiny of expense ledger for \\\\\\\\n'consultancy charges' for FY 2017-18, it was noted that the corporate has paid Rs. \\\\\\\\n1,728,452.00 to 'Loss Village Green Barn Pvt. Ltd.'; which is a/so group company of the \\\\\\\\ncorporate agent. Subsequent examination of copy of invoices submitted by the corporate \\\\\\\\nagent in support of it, showed that consultancy payment was related to 'marketing \\\\\\\\nactivity done at various points in Ram Nagar Nainital, Uttarakhand'. From above \\\\\\\\nsubmission of corporate agent, it can be concluded that it has engaged untrained and \\\\\\\\nunauthorised persons to bring in business \\\\\\\\n10 Submission of CA: \\\\\\\\nThe CA submitted that they are in compliance of the stated regulations and in the given \\\\\\\\ncase the CA submitted--: \\\\\\\\nThat by using the services of \"Lost Village Green Barn Private Limited\" for marketing \\\\\\\\nactivities at various points of Nainital, they have not violated the stipulated regulations. \\\\\\\\nThe conclusion that the said marketing activity is nothing but solicitation is a sprawling \\\\\\\\nremark. \\\\\\\\nTheir understanding of difference in marketing activities and solicitation is as under: \\\\\\\\nMarketing: \\\\\\\\no \\\\\\\\nIt is the process of communicating the value of a product or service through \\\\\\\\npositioning to customers. It is an activity coupled with processes for creating, \\\\\\\\ncommunicating, delivering and exchange offerings that have value for customers, \\\\\\\\nclients, partners and society at large. \\\\\\\\no \\\\\\\\nMarketing is any technique used to make the public aware of a company and \\\\\\\\nwhat it has to offer over its competitors. The variations of marketing activities are \\\\\\\\nvast and encompass almost every kind of media and company -\\\\\\\\ninitiated \\\\\\\\noutreach. \\\\\\\\no Marketing satisfies these needs and wants through exchange processes and \\\\\\\\nbuilding long term relationships. It is the link between a society's material \\\\\\\\nrequirements and its economic patterns of response. \\\\\\\\nSolicitation: \\\\\\\\no \\\\\\\\nIn civil law, solicitation means any request or appeal, either oral or written, or any \\\\\\\\nendeavour to obtain, seek or plead for funds, property, financial assistance or \\\\\\\\nother things of value, including the promise or grant of any money or property of \\\\\\\\ndorvalue.\\\\\\\\no Solicitation must be addressed to a particular individual for instance, a letter \\\\\\\\nconstitutes a solicitation. However, a newspaper advertisement, would not be an \\\\\\\\nact of solicitation because it is not addressed to any particular individual. \\\\\\\\nAlthough solicitation is used in a variety of legal contexts but cannot be applied here to \\\\\\\\nthe marketing activities carried out by \"Lost Village Green Barn Private Limited\". The \\\\\\\\ndefinition of \"Solicitation\" is already provided in the Insurance broking Regulation and the \\\\\\\\ndistance marketing guidelines as published by IRDAI. \\\\\\\\nIt is submitted that, the conclusion regarding the said marketing activity is nothing but \\\\\\\\nsolicitation by the employees of \"Lost Village Green Barn Private Limited\" as arrived at \\\\\\\\nby the Hon'ble Authority here, does not befit the solicitation law and its legal definition in \\\\\\\\nthis case. \\\\\\\\nAs regards to the observation on involvement of unlicensed person in solicitation of \\\\\\\\nbusiness, the CA wishes to submit that, they are a responsible corporate agency. The \\\\\\\\nCA follows a pre-defined SOP, as stated in their board approved policy for solicitation \\\\\\\\nand business procurement. The CA have a stringent process of solicitation and \\\\\\\\nprocurement of insurance business, as illustrated in their shared SOP. \\\\\\\\nThe CA wishes to reiterate that, at no stage they involve any unlicensed person in the \\\\\\\\nsolicitation process. There can be slight variation in the signatures of designated SP \\\\\\\\nwhich may happen, may be due to various reasons, but they categorically wish to state \\\\\\\\nhere that they do not engage untrained and unauthorised persons to bring in business. \\\\\\\\n(b) \\\\\\\\nUpon examination of sample dockets, it was observed that there were no \\\\\\\\nsignatures of Specified persons in the proposal forms collected from prospects for \\\\\\\\nsubmission to insurers for issuance of policies. It was a/so observed in the sample \\\\\\\\ncases that signatures of the same SP on the proposal forms/A CR were neither matching \\\\\\\\nwith each other nor with the signatures mentioned in the Permanent Account Number \\\\\\\\nsubmitted to the CA. \\\\\\\\n11 \\\\\\\\nSubmission of CA: \\\\\\\\nThey acknowledged that at places where the signatures of SP are not available are \\\\\\\\ninadvertent error on their part and they undertook and assure IRDAI that henceforth \\\\\\\\nsuch errors will not occur. At instances where slight deviation in signatures of SP is \\\\\\\\nobserved, it may be because the SP has done the signature in a hurry resulting in \\\\\\\\ndifference in flow. The signatures are a proof that the policies have been sold by SP. \\\\\\\\nThe CA further informed that with time the flow of signatures change and varies with \\\\\\\\npassage of time. They submitted that all the signatures have been done by stipulated \\\\\\\\nSPs only and there is no question of impersonating at all. \\\\\\\\nThe CA do have sufficient internal controls and systems and have not violated the \\\\\\\\nregulations or the clauses mentioned there under. \\\\\\\\n12 \\\\\\\\nSubmission during Hearing: \\\\\\\\nIn regard to mismatch between the signatures of the SP the CA submitted that the SPs \\\\\\\\nv,:d to simply put their initials and not made full signatures. Now, post the inspection,\\\\\\\\nthe CA has started to ensure that the SPs put their full signature and not initial the \\\\\\\\nproposals. \\\\\\\\nAlso the CA will ensure that the insurer does not accept the proposal \\\\\\\\nunless it is fully signed by the SP. \\\\\\\\n13 \\\\\\\\nPost hearing, the CA has submitted a letter mentioning therein regard to this \\\\\\\\ncharge, that --\\\\\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\ntransaction in question could be classified at that time as a related party \\\\\\\\ntransaction and that the company in question M/s. Lost Village Green Barn Pvt Ltd. \\\\\\\\ninvolved in stevia farming and is based in the State of Uttarakhand. Being a developing \\\\\\\\nand hilly state with extreme under penetrated insurance population the CA decided to do \\\\\\\\na pilot project for creating insurance awareness and this initiative may further open door \\\\\\\\nto reach out in all the districts of this state. However this exercise gave the CA limited \\\\\\\\nresults due to the limited scale of economy of the state. \\\\\\\\nAll the said signatures belonged to SP in the ACR. There were few policies where the \\\\\\\\ninitials were done and policies were accepted based on the same. \\\\\\\\nThis was also \\\\\\\\nsubmitted in their response to the observation of the Authority. The CA would submit \\\\\\\\nto the authority that they are \\\\\\\\nensuring compliance on all such advisory and any such \\\\\\\\nissue will not be repeated in future and they would implement strict quality checks and \\\\\\\\nbalances in all the processes. \\\\\\\\n14 \\\\\\\\nDecision: \\\\\\\\nOut of 20 sample documents examined by the inspection, there were no signatures \\\\\\\\nin the space provided for signature of the Advisor in 8 proposal forms. \\\\\\\\nIn another \\\\\\\\n12 proposals that are claimed to have been solicited by one SP, on verification of \\\\\\\\nthe signature with the sample signature of the SP, there was clear mismatch in the \\\\\\\\nsignature, \\\\\\\\nwhich proves that the said 12 proposals were \\\\\\\\nnot solicited by him. \\\\\\\\nThese 12 proposals were solicited on five different dates viz 12-6-17 ( 2 policies), \\\\\\\\n28-6-17 ( 2 policies), 29-6-17 (3 policies), 10-7-17 (4 policies), 13-7-17 (one policy). \\\\\\\\nHence it is clearly established that the CA has engaged unlicensed persons on the \\\\\\\\nabove mentioned five dates. \\\\\\\\nIn the above manner, the CA violated Clause 3(ii)(a) and 3(ii)(m) of Schedule Ill \\\\\\\\nunder Regulation 26 of the IRDAI (Registration of Corporate Agents) Regulations, \\\\\\\\n2015. \\\\\\\\nTherefore, by virtue of the powers vested in it under Section 102(b) of the Insurance \\\\\\\\nAct, 1938, the Authority imposes on the CA a penalty of Rs.5,00,000 (Rupees Five \\\\\\\\nlakh only) for the above said violation [the amount of penalty has been arrived at on \\\\\\\\nthe basis of Rs.1 lakh per day for 5 days on which the solicitation by the unlicenced \\\\\\\\nsons took place).\\\\\\\\n15 \\\\\\\\nSummary of Decisions: \\\\\\\\nThe following is the summary of decisions in this order: \\\\\\\\nBrief description of charge with provision under Decision \\\\\\\\nwhich the entity was charged: \\\\\\\\nCharge No.1 \\\\\\\\nExcess commission received by the CA \\\\\\\\nAdvisory \\\\\\\\nViolation of Regulation 18(1) of IRDAI (Registration of \\\\\\\\nCorporate Agents) Regulation, 2015. \\\\\\\\nCharge No.2 \\\\\\\\nEngaging unlicensed persons for solicitation o f business \\\\\\\\nPenalty of Rs.5 lakh \\\\\\\\nViolation of Clause 3(ii)(a) and clause 3(ii)(m) of \\\\\\\\nschedule Ill read in conjunction with regulation 26 of \\\\\\\\nIRDAI (Registration of Corporate Agents) Regulations, \\\\\\\\n2015. \\\\\\\\n16 \\\\\\\\nAs directed under the respective charge, the penalty of Rs. 5 lakh \\\\\\\\nshall be \\\\\\\\nremitted by the Corporate Agent within a period of 15 days from the date of receipt \\\\\\\\nof this Order through NEFT/ RTGS (details for which will be communicated \\\\\\\\nseparately). An intimation of remittance may be sent to Mr.Prabhat Kumar Maiti, \\\\\\\\nGeneral Manager (Enforcement) at the Insurance Regulatory and Development \\\\\\\\nAuthority of India, Sy. No. 115/1; Financial District; Nanakramguda; Gachibowli; \\\\\\\\nHyderabad - 500032. \\\\\\\\n17 \\\\\\\\nThe CA shall confirm compliance in respect of all the directions within 21 days from \\\\\\\\nthe date of receipt of this order. The order shall be placed before the CA's Audit \\\\\\\\ncommittee and also in the next immediate Board meeting and the CA shall submit to the \\\\\\\\nAuthority a copy of the minutes of the discussion. \\\\\\\\n18 \\\\\\\\nIf the CA feels aggrieved by any of the decisions in this order, an appeal may be \\\\\\\\npreferred to the Securities Appellate Tribunal as per Section 110 of the Insurance Act, \\\\\\\\n1938. \\\\\\\\nThe CA is required to acknowledge receipt of this order. \\\\\\\\nPlace : Hyderabad \\\\\\\\nDate: \\\\\\\\november, 2020", "Date": "2020-11-18", "Regulatory": "IRDAI", "Title": "Final order in the matter of M/s.
