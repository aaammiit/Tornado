He knew the suspected entity Smt Vajramma (Noticee no. 3) as mother of his friend, Shri Pardhasaradhi Uppalapati (Noticee no. 4), and he was placing orders in the trading accounts of Smt Vajramma in the scrip of Suven on the request of Noticee no. 4. He also stated that he knew JFT which was promoted by the promoters of Suven. Shri VL Rao has been associated with Suven since November 02, 1989 when he joined Suven as Accountant and therefore has an association with Suven exceeding 25 years. It is thus observed that Shri VL Rao knew Shri Pardhasaradhi (Noticee no. 4), who in turn is an insider as per regulation 2(1)(d)(ii)(a) read with regulation 2(1)(g)(i) of PIT Regulations, 2015, for more than 25 years and he was the only person who was authorized to place orders on behalf of Smt Vajramma during the IP. Thus, it is observed that Shri VL Rao was a connected person who was reasonably expected to have access to the UPSI as per regulation 2(1)(d)(i) of PIT Regulations, 2015 and, hence, an insider as per regulation 2(1)(g)(i) of PIT Regulations, 2015.Final Order in the matter of Suven Life Sciences Ltd. Page 12 of 35  3.30. Vide email dated June 20, 2017, the stock broker (viz. ICICI Securities Ltd) mentioned that Shri VL Rao placed orders through online mode during the relevant period. 3.31. In view of the above facts, it is summarized as under: i) With respect to the trades attributed to JFT (Noticee no. 1), who is a connected person and an insider, it is alleged that its trades in the scrip of Suven, were being placed by an insider, Shri Venkateswralu Jasti (Noticee no. 2), Chairman & CEO of Suven Life Sciences Ltd. ii) It is alleged that Shri Venkateswarlu (Noticee no. 2) who was an insider has communicated the UPSI to his brother-in-law Shri Pardhasaradhi (Noticee no. 4), who was taking investment decisions on behalf of his mother, Smt Vajramma (Noticee no. 3). iii) With respect to the trades attributed to Shri Vajramma (Noticee no. 3) who is a connected person and insider, it is alleged that the orders in the said trading account relating to Smt Vajramma were being placed by Shri VL Rao (Noticee no. 5) upon request of his friend Shri Pardhasaradhi (Noticee no. 4) during the relevant period. It is also observed that Smt Vajramma\\\\\\\\u2019s son, Shri Pardhasaradhi (Noticee no. 4), takes care of management of her investible funds whereas the role of Smt Vajramma was limited to merely signing necessary papers as and when required. It is therefore alleged that Smt Vajramma had lent her account for trading.  iv) Shri VL Rao (Noticee no. 5) (who is a connected person and insider) was placing orders on her behalf, upon the request of his friend Shri Pardhasaradhi (who is also a connected person and an insider).  3.32. As per Sections 12A(d) and 12A(e) of the SEBI Act, 1992, a person, is prohibited from engaging in insider trading or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly, while in possession of material or non-public information. In view of the same, it is alleged that Noticees 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, being insiders within the definition of the relevant provision of PIT Regulations, 2015, had traded, directly or indirectly, in the scrip of Suven while in possession of UPSI and have thereby allegedly violated Regulation 4(1) of the PIT Regulations, 2015 and Section 12A(d) and (e) of the SEBI Act, 1992.Final Order in the matter of Suven Life Sciences Ltd. Page 13 of 35  3.33. As per Section 12A(d) and 12A(e), a person is prohibited from directly or indirectly engaging in insider trading and also from communicating material or non-public information to any other person. It is therefore alleged that, Noticee no. 2, being insider within the definition of the relevant provision of PIT Regulations, 2015 had communicated UPSI to Noticee no. 4 and has thereby allegedly violated Regulation 3(1) of the PIT Regulations, 2015 and Section 12A(d) and (e) of the SEBI Act, 1992.  Profits made by Noticee 1 while trading in the scrip of Suven during the UPSI period:   3.34. The Closing Price of the scrip on the day of UPSI becoming Public was Rs. 231.55/- and Rs. 230.80/- on BSE and NSE, respectively.

Vide a letter dated February 01, 2019 the Noticees sought inspection of documents. An opportunity of inspection of documents was provided to the Noticees on July 16, 2019 which the Noticees availed. Thereafter, an opportunity of hearing was provided to the Noticees on April 08, 2020. The Noticees sought adjournment due to non- availability of their counsel. A final opportunity of hearing was granted to the Noticee on November 06, 2020. The Authorized Representative of the Noticee appeared through video conference on the said date and made submissions.   6. Vide its email dated November 29, 2020 the Noticees made the following reply cum written submissions with respect to the allegations in the SCN:    6.1. The SCN alleges that the purchases of shares of Suven made by Noticee No. 1, Noticee No. 3 and Noticee No. 5 and the sale of shares by Noticee No. 5 (100 shares) between June 17, 2015 and September 10, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cUPSI period\\\\\\\\u201d) was motivated by possession of allegedly UPSI.  Such alleged UPSI is alleged to the contents of the press release issued on September 10, 2015 (\\\\\\\\u201cPress Release\\\\\\\\u201d).   In other words, the allegation is that the underlying contents of the Press Release would per se be regarded as UPSI and any and every trade effected when in possession of such contents would be regarded as being violative of the Regulation 4(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 (\\\\\\\\u201cPIT Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), and thereby Section 12A (d) and (e) of the SEBI Act, 1992.   6.2. The aforesaid allegation is sought to be supported by an assumption that the Press Release led to a rise in price of the shares of the Company, and thereby the contents of the Press Release are alleged to constitute UPSI.  6.3. The Company is in the business of design, manufacture and supply of bulk actives, drug intermediaries and fine chemicals, drug discovery and development supportFinal Order in the matter of Suven Life Sciences Ltd. Page 15 of 35  services and contract research and manufacturing services and its shares are listed on the BSE Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cBSE\\\\\\\\u201d) and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cNSE\\\\\\\\u201d).  6.4. The drugs research and development by the Company generates intellectual property.  A routine and integral feature of such work is to secure and ring-fence such intellectual property from infringement. This is much like a company that manufactures products, building security measures around its factories and warehouses to protect its physical property.  The process of protecting and fencing intellectual property is to apply for and secure patents in different jurisdictions. The grant of a patent is a basic activity that registers and records that the Company is the owner of its intellectual property. Whether such intellectual property can actually be monetized and would yield revenues would depend on various subsequent and prolonged processes such as approval from drug regulators, laboratory trials, clinical trials and eventual endorsement of a specific application of a specific molecule of the Company for a specific purpose. 6.5. The Press Release was a routine one much like the multiple press releases the Company issues, covering the subject of getting patents in five specific jurisdictions for five specific molecules.  The term \\\\\\\\u201cproduct patent\\\\\\\\u201d is a term under patent law that essentially protects the inventor of a molecule from anyone copying the molecule through whichever process is adopted for getting such product.  The grant of a \\\\\\\\u201cproduct patent\\\\\\\\u201d does not mean there is a ready marketable product on hand \\\\\\\\u2013 all it means is that a particular product stands identified as being the intellectual property of the patent-holder. The Company routinely applies for and obtains product patents to mark its property rights in the intellectual property generated by the Company. The Press Release merely announced the grant of recognition to such property rights in five countries.  There was nothing special about the five countries that would render the registration of the patent as being a material development, nor for that matter was there anything unique about the patents in these five countries that was not already protected in other countries or would be protected in other countries where similar applications for registration are made.  6.6. A short glimpse of how the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s routine activity is to apply for and secure patents in different jurisdictions is seen from the following:Final Order in the matter of Suven Life Sciences Ltd. Page 16 of 35  Sr. No.  Financial Year  Number of Patents Secured Worldwide  1.   2014-15  120  2.   2015-16  195  3.   2016-17  141    Total  456    6.7. In fact, Annexure 2 to the SCN, inherently shows multiple announcements of the Company having obtained such product patents all around the world and that press releases about them were issued by the Company at regular intervals in Financial Year 201516. So also, Annexure 5 of the SCN shows that unlike decisions that require disclosure under Regulation 30 of the LODR Regulations, or material developments that are discussed by the Board of Directors before issuance of press releases, there was no practice or requirement for holding a Board Meeting for such issuance of routine press releases.  6.8. The press releases issued and summarized in Annexure 2 involved disclosure of receipt of such product patents for the molecules of the Company, each a \\\\\\\\u2018New Chemical Entity\\\\\\\\u2019 (\\\\\\\\u201cNCE\\\\\\\\u201d) for treatment of disorders associated with neurodegenerative diseas", "Date": "2021-04-27", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Order in the matter of Suven Life Sciences Ltd.", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/apr-2021/order-in-the-matter-of-suven-life-sciences-ltd-_49953.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 62188, "unique_record_id": "d8983f2f3dSEBI20210427", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6681d3e87858910306472b80", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 21:53:09", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Insider Trading", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "18,31,779 INR", "gpt_audience": "1.

It was stated in the SCN that an inspection of the stock broker was carried out by SEBI officials during September 9 & 11, 2013. The period covered under inspection was from April 2011 to till the date of inspection. The Registered office of the stock broker where the inspection was conducted is located at 22, R.N.

SEBI vide circular no. SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993 mandated segregation of funds and securities of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 accounts from Proprietary or Self Account. To check the veracity of information provided by the stock broker, the inspection team verified the bank account statements and demat statements for the period covered under inspection.Adjudication Order in respect of M/s. Consortium Capital Pvt. Ltd.          Page 4 of 13     6. To ascertain whether clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds were being mis-utilized by the stock broker, the team checked the segregation of pay-in obligations of randomly chosen 24 days during the period of inspection on the basis of exposure taken by the clients having net debit position, pro trades etc., on a particular day. The team also checked the fund flow to meet the exchange obligation in case the clients having net debit position has pay in obligations. It was observed that settlement obligations are met from A/c. No. 00990610006639 (Settlement Account).  7. It was observed by the inspection team that stock broker had transferred funds from Bank Account No. 00080130000432 (Loan Against shares Account (LAS Account)) and Bank Account No. 00080340007936 (Self-Account) to Bank Account No. 00990610006639 (Settlement Account) to meet the settlement obligations. Stock Broker has, therefore, allegedly used own funds or funds from the LAS Account to meet the settlement obligations.  8. It was also observed from the Self-Account that stock broker moved funds regularly from Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Account (00080340010748) to Self-Account and vice versa. Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds were, therefore, mixed with the own or borrowed funds by the stock broker. Stock Broker has, therefore, allegedly failed to segregate clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds from self or own funds.  9. Noticee was, therefore, alleged to have violated SEBI Circular No. SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993 read with Regulation 26(xiii), 26(xv), 26(xvi) of the Stock Broker Regulations. The relevant clauses of SEBI Circular and Regulations are reproduced as under:  SEBI Circular No. SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993: Regulation of Transactions between Clients and Brokers-Adjudication Order in respect of M/s.

A stock broker shall be liable for monetary penalty in respect of the following violations, namely: (xiii) Failure to segregate his own funds or securities from the client\\\\\\\\u2019s funds or securities or using the securities or funds of the client for his own purpose or for purpose of any other client. (xv) Failure to comply with directions issued by the Board under the Act or the regulations framed thereunder. (xvi) Failure to exercise due skill, care and diligence. 10. The SCN was issued at the following address available on record through Speed Post Acknowledgement Due (SPAD) to the Noticee on February 11, 2021, which was delivered successfully on February 17, 2021:  Room No.6, G/2, 6th Floor 34-A, Metcalfe street Kolkata - 700013  11. SCN was also issued by email at spasari.ccpl@gmail.com and shital_pasari@yahoo.co.in which was delivered to the Noticee. Thereafter, the Noticee in response to the SCN, filed the reply vide letter dated February 25, 2021.  12. The Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing on April 8, 2021 vide email dated March 15, 2021. Vide letter dated April 1, 2021, the Stock BrokerAdjudication Order in respect of M/s. Consortium Capital Pvt. Ltd.          Page 6 of 13  authorized Shri Jaikishan Poddar to appear for hearing in respect of the SCN. The authorized representative during the course of hearing reiterated the submissions made vide the aforesaid letter dated February 25, 2021.  13. The key submissions made by the Noticee are reproduced hereunder:  i. (a) Bank Account No. 00080130000432 (Loan against Share A/c) was basically an F.D Overdraft A/c wherever F.D was made with Banker out of own funds. Although the nomenclature was LAS but it was essentially an ODFD A/C. (b) Bank A/C No. 00080340007936 (Self A/C was own self A/c. (c) Bank A/c No. 00080340010748 (client A/c) was client A/c.  ii. Stock Broker had both client brokerage business as well as proprietary book.  iii. Funds for proprietary book were derived from their own net worth as well as borrowings from related sources.  iv. Noticee never used clients\\\\\\\\u2019 fund for their proprietary book. In fact it has been other way round. Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 fund always used to come a tad late in the day & settlement obligation need to be met early. So Stock Broker used to provide funds from their SELF A/C and LAS A/C to SETTLEMENT A/C. On receipt of funds, the same were repaid from CLIENT to SELF and LAS.  v. Noticee has never withdrawn brokerage from client A/c and all their expenses have been paid from Self A/c and balance ploughed back in business.  vi. Noticee has done no client funding as well as never charged any interest on client debit balance, which were there in normal course of business.Adjudication Order in respect of M/s. Consortium Capital Pvt. Ltd.          Page 7 of 13   vii. Noticee neither used client\\\\\\\\u2019s funds nor allowed clients to misuse their own funds. The fact can be ascertained that till date there are no bad debts neither any client has any grievance against the Stock Broker.  viii. Noticee are in the business since 2004 & till date has been meeting exchange & clients obligations. Moreover with evolving regulations these days\\\\\\\\u2019 things have been streamlined. Noticee, therefore, requested for taking lenient view.  14. As the inquiry in the matter has been completed, I now proceed to decide the case on the basis of SCN issued, reply made by the Noticees and material available on record. CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS:-  15. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are :  Issue No. I Whether Noticee is in violation of SEBI Circular No. SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993 read with Regulation 26(xiii), 26(xv), 26(xvi) of Stock Broker Regulations?

The allegation is that the Stock Broker failed to segregate clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds from his own funds. In this connection, I note that documentary evidences available before me are Bank account statements such as Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Account (Bank A/c No. 00080340010748), Self-Account (Bank A/c No. 00080340007936), and Settlement Account (Bank A/c No. 00990610006639).  17. Bank account statement relating to Client\\\\\\\\u2019s Account for the period August 1, 2012 to August 31, 2012 show that on August 1, 2012, Rs.3,00,000/- got transferred to Self-Account of the Stock Broker. On the same day, Rs. 7,05,000/- was credited into the Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Account from Self Account. On August 2, 2012 Rs. 10 lakhs got transferred from Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Account to Self-Account. Again Rs. 11, 40,000/- was debited from Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Account on August 3, 2012 and credited to Self-Account. On August 4, 2012, there is a debit transaction in Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Account for an amount of Rs. 2,92,473.44/- and the same was credited to Self-Account of the Stock broker. I note there are several such transactions throughout the month.  There were 21 such debit transactions for an amount of Rs.56,60,473.44/- during the month from Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Account to Self-Account. Similarly, there were 10 credit transactions from Self Account to Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Account during the month for an amount of Rs. 44,60,000/-.  18. Bank account statement pertaining to Self-Account for the period August 1, 2012 to August 31, 2012 indicates that Rs. 69,00,000/- was transferred to Settlement Account from Self Account through a number of 22 transactions. Similarly, Rs.2,28,10,714.21/- was credited from Settlement Account to Self-Account in 19 transactions during the month.Adjudication Order in respect of M/s. Consortium Capital Pvt. Ltd.          Page 9 of 13  19. For the month of June 1, 2013 to June 30, 2013, I note that the bank account statement of Self Account of the Stock Broker shows 9 debit transactions through which an amount of Rs. 16,40,000/- was transferred to Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Account. Further, an amount of Rs.96,51,000/- was transferred from Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Account to Self-Account during the month through 23 transactions.  20. From the above, I note that huge funds in fact were transferred on several occasions from Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Account to Self-Account of the Stock Broker and vice-versa. Further, funds were also moved from Self Account to Settlement Account and vice-versa multiple times. Having regard to the above, I also consider the submissions made by the Noticee subsequent to receipt of the SCN, wherein it was stated that that they have both client brokerage business and proprietary book as well and clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds always used to come a tad late in the day. As settlement obligation has to be met early, Stock Broker provided funds from Self Account and LAS A/C to Settlement Account. On receipt of funds the same were repaid from Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Account to Self-Account and LAS A/c. The Noticee also submitted that they have never misused client\\\\\\\\u2019s funds.  21. The issue before me is to determine whether the Noticee failed to segregate the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds from that of Stock Broker and is there any mixing of clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds with own funds of stock broker. The question is not about if the Stock Broker has misused the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds for his own purpose. Based on the evidences available, specifically bank account statements, it is clear that clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds were moved by Stock Broker on a frequent basis from Clients\\\\\\\\u2019 Account to Self-Account and vice-versa and funds were also moved from Self Account to Settlement Account and vice-versa. Thereby, it is clear that Stock broker failed to maintain clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds separately from Stock broker\\\\\\\\u2019s funds.Adjudication Order in respect of M/s. Consortium Capital Pvt. Ltd.          Page 10 of 13  22. In view of the facts on record, I find that the Noticee failed to segregate the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds from own finds of the stock broker and, thereby, violated provisions of SEBI Circular No. SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993 read with Regulation 26(xiii), 26(xv), 26(xvi) of Stock Broker Regulations.  Issue No. II: If yes, whether the failure, on the part of the Noticee would attract monetary penalty under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act and Section 23D of SC(R)A?  Issue No. III: If yes, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed upon the Noticee taking into consideration the factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act and 23J of SC(R)A read with Rule 5(2) of the SEBI Adjudication Rules and Rule 5(2) of the SCR Adjudication Rules?  23. As it has been established that the Noticee violated SEBI Circular No. SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993 read with Regulation 26(xiii), 26(xv), 26(xvi) of Stock Broker Regulations, Noticee is liable for imposition of monetary penalty under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act and Section 23D of SC(R)A, which are reproduced below: SEBI Act:  Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided.  15HB. Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees.  SC(R)A: Penalty for failure to segregate securities or moneys of client or clients-Adjudication Order in respect of M/s. Consortium Capital Pvt. Ltd.          Page 11 of 13  23D. If any person, who is registered under section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 as a stock broker or sub-broker, fails to segregate securities or moneys of the client or clients or uses the securities or moneys of a client or clients for self or for any other client, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees.  24. While determining the quantum of penalty under section 15HB of the SEBI Act, and Section 23D of SC(R)A, the following factors stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act and Section 23J of SC(R)A have to be given due regard: SEBI Act: Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer 15J. While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:- (a)the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b)the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  SC(R)A: Factors to be taken into account by adjudicating officer. 23J. While adjudging the quantum of penalty under section 23-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:\\\\\\\\u2014  (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.Adjudication Order in respect of M/s. Consortium Capital Pvt. Ltd.          Page 12 of 13   25. I note that the material on record does not reveal any disproportionate gains or unfair advantage made/ taken by the Noticee or loss caused to the investors as a result of the violation. However, I observe that the Noticee has failed to maintain funds of clients separately and mixed the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds with the own funds. In the submission in reply to SCN, Noticee has not denied the charge that clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds were not segregated from own funds. In fact the Noticee has admitted that clients\\\\\\\\u2019 fund always used to come a tad late in the day & settlement obligation need to be met early. So Stock Broker used to provide funds from their Self Account and LAS Account to Settlement Account and on receipt of funds, the same were repaid from Client Account to Self-Account and LAS Account. Being a registered Stock Broker with SEBI, Noticee is obliged to comply with the regulatory requirement of maintaining clients\\\\\\\\u2019 fund separately from own funds.  26. Therefore, taking into account the aforesaid factors, and considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the view that a penalty of Rs.1,00,000/- will be commensurate with the violations committed by the Noticee.  ORDER  27. After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, in exercise of powers conferred upon me under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act and 23-I of SC(R)A read with Rule 5 of the SEBI Adjudication Rules and Rule of the SCR Adjudication Rules, I hereby impose the penalty of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) upon the Noticee, M/s. Consortium Capital Pvt. Ltd., under Section 15HB of SEBI Act and 23D of SC(R)A for violation of SEBI Circular No. SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993 read with Regulation 26(xiii), 26(xv), 26(xvi) of Stock Broker Regulations.Adjudication Order in respect of M/s.

The Commission provided its consent through consent letter\\\\\\\\nNo. BSEC/CI/IPO-202/2012/305 dated May 03, 2018 for IPO as well as issuance of prospectus by\\\\\\\\nACFL. In the prospectus it is mentioned that the Company would implement the IPO in the\\\\\\\\nfollowing proceeds:\\\\\\\\na) Acquisition & installation of machineries\\\\\\\\nb) Loan Repayment\\\\\\\\nc) Net proceeds\\\\\\\\nd) IPO Expenses\\\\\\\\nAs per prospectus \\\\\\\\u201cNet proceeds from Initial Public Offering (\\\\\\\\u201cIPO\\\\\\\\u201d) will be used for acquisition\\\\\\\\nand installation of brand-new European machinery for expansion of existing project by increasing\\\\\\\\nits capacity, repayment of existing long-term loan and defraying the IPO Expenses.\\\\\\\\u201d In this regard,\\\\\\\\nwe would like to draw your attention that ACFL is working thoroughly with European companies to\\\\\\\\npurchase the most delicate machinery that would carry out the Company's demand. However, due\\\\\\\\nto the sudden COVID-19 insurgent all over Europe, businesses were affected the most. As a result,\\\\\\\\nACFL's disposition on purchasing machinery from Europe was on hold until everything goes back\\\\\\\\nto its standard arrangement. Moreover, pursuant to the COVID-19 situation, no foreign experts\\\\\\\\nwere available to guide us through our expansion. Additionally, due to the shortage of machinery\\\\\\\\nin the international market, it was not possible to accumulate those requisite machineries from any\\\\\\\\nother supplier as well. Thus, for acquisition and installation of machinery, Tk. 663,375,000.00 was\\\\\\\\nnot utilized up to date; instead, the said amounts were invested in FDR for safeguarding the\\\\\\\\nshareholders. Additionally, as the COVID-19 situation is getting better, the ACFL has contacted\\\\\\\\nprospective suppliers, which is still in the negotiation stage. and soon we will be able to finalise the\\\\\\\\npurchase of European machinery from a prospective vendor.\\\\\\\\nFurthermore, we would also like to inform you that after starting its commercial operation in\\\\\\\\nNovember 2007, the Company has already established a presence in the cotton yarn market of the\\\\\\\\ncountry on the back of long-standing relationships with clients through its diversified product\\\\\\\\nrange and product quality in the last decade. Keeping up with ACFL\\\\\\\\u2019s esteem reputation both in\\\\\\\\nthe national and international market, it is steadfast in fully complying with the terms and\\\\\\\\nconditions with respect to IPO utilization as well as applicable laws of the country.\\\\\\\\nAllegation (b) \\\\\\\\u2014 We found that the IPO fund was used for the repayment of the IBBL loan\\\\\\\\naccordingly (amounting to Tk. 2,15,77,775). Repayment was traced on 14\" August 2018 from\\\\\\\\nCity Bank Limited (A/C 2921399871001). However, for Union Capital, the loan was repaid of\\\\\\\\nonly Tk, 1,37,54,440/- out of Tk. 8,00,47,225/-. This covers only 17.18% of the required\\\\\\\\nrepayment criteria.

Moreover, the loan was repaid to Union Capital Limited in the amount of\\\\\\\\nTk. 11,282,835/-only on various dates from ACFL\\\\\\\\u2019s own account before establishing IPO\\\\\\\\nfund. Thereafter, we have also paid an amount of Tk. 2,471,605/- from the IPO proceed and\\\\\\\\nTk. 1,48,30,025/-from the Company's own fund. Given that we have paid an aggregated\\\\\\\\namount of Tk. 26,112,860/-in favour of Union Capital on various occasions. It is pertinent to\\\\\\\\nnote that the Commission has allowed us to raise paid-up capital through IPO on 3rd May\\\\\\\\n2018. However, before receiving the IPO fund, we were required to repay the loan amount\\\\\\\\nfrom ACFL's own account to Union Capital; otherwise, ACFL would have suffered an\\\\\\\\nirreparable loss. Furthermore, ACFL, in their shareholders 14th Annual General Meeting,\\\\\\\\napproved that the rest of the balanced amount of Tk. 5,39,34,365/- will be paid from the\\\\\\\\nCompany's own fund to Union Capital Limited.\\\\\\\\nAllegation (c) \\\\\\\\u2014 We observed that out of a total repayment of Tk. 1,3 7,54,440/- only Tk. 24,71,605/-\\\\\\\\nwas used from the IPO account and the rest of Tk. 1,12,82,935/-was found to be repaid even before\\\\\\\\nthe IPO fund was credited in designated Bank account (The City Bank Limited A/C-\\\\\\\\n29213998710001). The further loan from Union Capital was repaid from escrow accounts (Woori\\\\\\\\nBank) of Tk. 25,14,815/- due to insufficient balance on IPO accounts.\\\\\\\\na\\\\\\\\nACEL is categorically rejecting the allegation (c) claimed by the special auditor. In response to\\\\\\\\nallegation (c), it is stated that ACFL, on July 28, 2016, applied to the BSEC for permission to raise\\\\\\\\npaid-up capital through an IPO, and the BSEC provided its consent on May 3, 2018, for the same.\\\\\\\\nPrior to receiving IPO funds, i.e. the period before 2018, ACFL, as part of its loan repayment\\\\\\\\nobligation, made a payment of Tk. 1,12,82,835/- to Union Capital on various dates from the its own\\\\\\\\nfunds; otherwise, ACFL would have been exposed to substantial monetary burden in the form of\\\\\\\\nbank interests. Owing to such reasoning ACFL had repaid those outstanding loan amounts from\\\\\\\\nACFL's own fund instead of the IPO fund. Subsequently, ACFL reimbursed such loan repayment\\\\\\\\namount from the IPO fund for their expenditure which it earlier used from its own fund. Table 1.1\\\\\\\\nbelow shows the breakdown of IPO expenditure.\\\\\\\\nAllegation (d)- We found that the IPO fund was utilized for the payment of IPO Expenses,\\\\\\\\namounting to Tk. 3,47,60,628/-. Out of the total IPO expense, Tk. 1,96,78,584/- was spend before\\\\\\\\nfund money was credited and Tk. 1,50,82,044/- only was used from the IPO fund.\\\\\\\\n6. As stated above, ACFL applied to the Commission for raising paid-up capital through IPO on 28th\\\\\\\\nJuly, 2016 and subsequently received consent from BSEC on 3rd May, 2018. Before receiving IPO\\\\\\\\nfund in 2018, ACFL was required to repay the loan amount of Tk. 1,12.82,835/- only on various\\\\\\\\ndates from its own fund in favour of Union Capital. Moreover, ACFL also paid an amount of Tk.\\\\\\\\n3,48,11,028/- from its own fund on account of audit fees, subscription fees, perquisite expenses,\\\\\\\\nmarketing expense etc as IPO expenses. It is pertinent to note that since the said IPO expenses\\\\\\\\nwere to be incurred even before receiving the IPO fund it was implausible to wait for the IPO fund\\\\\\\\nand as such, those expenses had to be expended from its own fund; otherwise ACFL would have\\\\\\\\nbeen subjected to significant monetary burden. To mitigate that undue financial burden, ACFL\\\\\\\\ndecided 10 pay various expenses related to IPO from their own fund. Later after receiving the IPO\\\\\\\\nfund, ACFL reimbursed the amount (Tk. 3,00,00,000/-) it had incurred from its own fund between\\\\\\\\nIPO application date to IPO Fund receipt date.

However, ACFL\\\\\\\\ncould not provide us any such documents to verify the fact that the IPO fund has been used for its\\\\\\\\ndesignated purpose. Also, it was mentioned in the Auditor\\\\\\\\u2019s Certificate, issued by Shafiq Bashak&\\\\\\\\nCo. on 05 July 2020, it is reported that \\\\\\\\u201cNo asset was procured/imported/constructed by Aman Cotton\\\\\\\\nFibrous Limited using IPO proceeds as of June 30,2020.\\\\\\\\n1. With respect of Allegation (a) it is submitted that ACFL applied to the Commission for raising\\\\\\\\ncapital through IPO on July 28, 2016. The Commission provided its consent through consent letter\\\\\\\\nNo. BSEC/CVIPO-202/201 2/305 dated May 03, 2018 for IPO as well as issuance of prospectus by\\\\\\\\nACFL. In the prospectus it is mentioned that the Company would implement the IPO in the\\\\\\\\nfollowing proceeds:\\\\\\\\na) Acquisition & installation of machineries\\\\\\\\nb) Loan Repayment\\\\\\\\nc) Net proceeds\\\\\\\\nd) IPO Expenses\\\\\\\\n2. As per prospectus \\\\\\\\u201cNet proceeds from Initial Public Offering (\\\\\\\\u201cIPO\\\\\\\\u201d) will be used for acquisition\\\\\\\\nand installation of brand-new European machinery for expansion of existing project by increasing\\\\\\\\nits capacity, repayment of existing long-term loan and defraying the IPO Expenses.\\\\\\\\u201d In this regard,\\\\\\\\nwe would like to draw your attention that ACFL is working thoroughly with European companies to\\\\\\\\npurchase the most delicate machinery that would carry out the Company's demand. However, due\\\\\\\\nto the sudden COVID-19 insurgent all over Europe, businesses were affected the most. As a result,\\\\\\\\nACFL's disposition on purchasing machinery from Europe was on hold until everything goes back\\\\\\\\nto its standard arrangement. Moreover, pursuant to the COVID-19 situation, no foreign experts\\\\\\\\nwere available to guide us through our expansion. Additionally, due to the shortage of machinery\\\\\\\\nin the international market, it was not possible to accumulate those requisite machineries from any\\\\\\\\nother supplier as well. Thus, for acquisition and installation of machinery, Tk. 663,375,000.00 was\\\\\\\\nnot utilized up to date; instead, the said amounts were invested in FDR for safeguarding the\\\\\\\\nshareholders. Additionally, as the COVID-19 situation is getting better, the ACFL has contacted\\\\\\\\nprospective suppliers, which is still in the negotiation stage, and soon we will be able to finalise the\\\\\\\\npurchase of European machinery from a prospective vendor.\\\\\\\\n3. Furthermore, we would also like to inform you that after starting its commercial operation in\\\\\\\\nNovember 2007, the Company has already established a presence in the cotton yarn market of the\\\\\\\\ncountry on the back of long-standing relationships with clients through its diversified product\\\\\\\\nrange and product quality in the last decade. Keeping up with ACFL\\\\\\\\u2019s esteem reputation both in\\\\\\\\nthe national and international market, it is steadfast in fully complying with the terms and\\\\\\\\nconditions with respect to IPO utilization as well as applicable laws of the country.\\\\\\\\nAllegation (b) \\\\\\\\u2014 We found that the IPO fund was used for the repayment of the IBBL loan\\\\\\\\naccordingly (amounting to Tk. 2,15,77,775). Repayment was traced on 14\" August 2018 from\\\\\\\\nCity Bank Limited (A/C 2921399871001). However, for Union Capital, the loan was repaid of\\\\\\\\nonly Tk. 1,37,54,440/- out of Tk. 8,00,47,225/-. This covers only 17.18% of the required\\\\\\\\nrepayment criteria. Till our verification the loan of Union Capital was not fully paid.MUJIB\\\\\\\\naad ter xq feces\\\\\\\\u201d\\\\\\\\naffirmed and acknowledged by the special auditor as evident from your show cause notice\\\\\\\\ndated 16.06.2021. Moreover, the loan was repaid to Union Capital Limited in the amount of\\\\\\\\nTk. 11,282,835/-only on various dates from ACFL\\\\\\\\u2019s own account before establishing IPO\\\\\\\\nfund. Thereafter, we have also paid an amount of Tk. 2,471,605/- from the IPO proceed and\\\\\\\\nTk. 1,48,30,025/-from the Company's own fund. Given that we have paid an aggregated\\\\\\\\namount of Tk. 26,112,860/-in favour of Union Capital on various occasions. It is pertinent to\\\\\\\\nnote that the Commission has allowed us to raise paid-up capital through IPO on 3rd May\\\\\\\\n2018. However, before receiving the IPO fund, we were required to repay the loan amount\\\\\\\\nJrom ACFL\\\\\\\\u2019s own account to Union Capital; otherwise, ACFL would have suffered an\\\\\\\\nirreparable loss. Furthermore, ACFL, in their shareholders 14th Annual General Meeting,\\\\\\\\napproved that the rest of the balanced amount of Tk. 5,39,34,365/- will be paid from the\\\\\\\\nCompany's own fund to Union Capital Limited.\\\\\\\\nAllegation (c) \\\\\\\\u2014 We observed that out of a total repayment of Tk. 1,37,54,440/- only Tk. 24,71,605/-\\\\\\\\nwas used from the IPO account and the rest of Tk. 1,12,82,935/-was found to be repaid even before\\\\\\\\nthe IPO fund was credited in designated Bank account (The City Bank Limited A/C-\\\\\\\\n29213998710001). The further loan from Union Capital was repaid from escrow accounts (Woori\\\\\\\\nBank) of Tk. 25,14,815/- due to insufficient balance on IPO accounts.\\\\\\\\n5. ACFL is categorically rejecting the allegation (c) claimed by the special auditor. In response to\\\\\\\\nallegation (c), it is stated that ACFL, on July 28, 2016, applied to the BSEC for permission to raise\\\\\\\\npaid-up capital through an IPO, and the BSEC provided its consent on May 3, 2018, for the same.\\\\\\\\nPrior to receiving IPO funds, i.e. the period before 2018, ACFL, as part of its loan repayment\\\\\\\\nobligation, made a payment of Tk. 1,12,82,835/- to Union Capital on various dates from the its own\\\\\\\\nfunds; otherwise, ACFL would have been exposed to substantial monetary burden in the form of\\\\\\\\nbank interests. Owing to such reasoning ACFL had repaid those outstanding loan amounts from\\\\\\\\nACFL's own fund instead of the IPO fund. Subsequently, ACFL reimbursed such loan repayment\\\\\\\\namount from the IPO fund for their expenditure which it earlier used from its own fund. Table 1.1\\\\\\\\nbelow shows the breakdown of IPO expenditure.\\\\\\\\nAllegation (d)- We found that the IPO fund was utilized for the payment of IPO Expenses,\\\\\\\\namounting to Tk. 3,47,60,628/-. Out of the total IPO expense, Tk. 1,96,78,584/- was spend before\\\\\\\\nfund money was credited and Tk. 1,50,82,044/- only was used from the IPO fund.\\\\\\\\n6. As stated above, ACFL applied to the Commission for raising paid-up capital through IPO on 28th\\\\\\\\nJuly, 2016 and subsequently received consent from BSEC on 3rd May, 2018. Before receiving IPO\\\\\\\\nfund in 2018, ACFL was required to repay the loan amount of Tk. 1,12,82,835/- only on various\\\\\\\\ndates from its own fund in favour of Union Capital. Moreover, ACFL also paid an amount of Tk.\\\\\\\\n3,48,11,028/- from its own fund on account of audit fees, subscription fees, perquisite expenses,\\\\\\\\nmarketing expense etc as IPO expenses. It is pertinent to note that since the said IPO expenses\\\\\\\\nwere to be incurred even before receiving the IPO fund it was implausible to wait for the IPO fund\\\\\\\\nand as such, those expenses had to be expended from its own fund; otherwise ACFL would have\\\\\\\\nbeen subjected to significant monetary burden. To mitigate that undue financial burden, ACFL\\\\\\\\ndecided to pay various expenses related to IPO from their own fund. Later after receiving the IPO\\\\\\\\nfund, ACFL reimbursed the amount (Tk. 3.00.00,000/-) it had incurred from its own fund between\\\\\\\\nate.

From the above mentioned price trend it is appeared that before\\\\\\\\nand after published the aforesaid declaration share price of the said company increased\\\\\\\\nsignificantly and influenced strongly. By influencing to increase share price,\\\\\\\\nsponsors/directors of the said company sold bulk quantity of shares and got benefit from\\\\\\\\nhigher price.\\\\\\\\nConsidering to acquire 4 (four) sea going steel bodied trawler and right issue, it is\\\\\\\\nconcluded that Directors of the said company believed that they will not be collect fund\\\\\\\\neither from foreign investment or from local financial institution and got consent from\\\\\\\\nBangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission for right issue. Finally Beach Hatchery\\\\\\\\nLimited cancelled to acquire 4 (four) sea going steel bodied trawler. But, the said\\\\\\\\ncompany did not publish the said price sensitive information regarding cancellation. Thus\\\\\\\\nall directors omitted to disclose the said material fact while selling the bulk quantity of\\\\\\\\nshare.\\\\\\\\nIn view of the above, directors of Beach Hatchery Limited, were engaged/operated to\\\\\\\\nacquire 4 (four) sea going steel bodied trawler as a fraud or deceit. Because by increasing\\\\\\\\nprice through using the said price sensitive information directors of the said company sold\\\\\\\\nthe aforesaid quantity of shares before concluding to acquire 4 (four) sea going steel\\\\\\\\nbodied trawler, as a fact of that which he does not believe to be true.\\\\\\\\nContravention: Through the aforesaid activities the said directors/sponsors of Beach\\\\\\\\nHatchery Limited violated Section 17 (a), (b) and (c) of Securities and Exchange Ordinance,\\\\\\\\n1969.\\\\\\\\u201d Unquote\\\\\\\\nTIRE, sir Uattaks afer at Histhite ota afore ator aay Dya \\\\\\\\xa2 Vas afaprerecna\\\\\\\\n@alata_ show-cause-cum-hearing notice 41 #%- BSEC/Enforcement/1 178/2013/628dated October\\\\\\\\n19,2014 4x aaaStow TH 98, 20de R wlfare yal fa eR a | eigS wiface Bpara aa aereAT\\\\\\\\nsafaris Gard cat: freer Ses Gafyw VA TT 9a, rode Be wifards wast srs Rw away me as, TES\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u201cyfesarts waters Uqur-adreas Ber wes Afeateta\\\\\\\\u201d\\\\\\\\nPhone (PABX) : +88-02-55007131-2 Fax : +88-02-55007106 E-mail : infow@sec.gov.bd Web : www.sec.gov.bdBANGLADESH SECT REETES UNDE AG HaANGE\\\\\\\\nk Nec iS B . x\\\\\\\\n: POU Awareanns.

There is instance that share of Tk.10/=face value\\\\\\\\nincreased by 2000% fetching market value of Tk.2000/= and above. After 96 debacle\\\\\\\\n2009 was a booming market and price of shares of all sectors increased steadily. Ours\\\\\\\\nwas a good share allthrough in terms of EPS. NAV and dividend yield. Hence at times\\\\\\\\nprice of our share increased, may be in faster rate occasionaly.\\\\\\\\n(ii) Our Directors sold shares after proper disclosures by complying all rules and\\\\\\\\nregulations. All transactions were made during December 2009 to May 2010 when\\\\\\\\naverage price was about Tk.55.00 (Highest being Tk.65.00 and lowest\\\\\\\\nTk.45.00).Whereas price of our share fetched highest level of Tk.119.10 in December\\\\\\\\n01, 2010. Had there been any manipulation on the part of Directors, selling shares,\\\\\\\\nthey could sell it at Tk.119.10 to yield almost double the price they got. In this context\\\\\\\\nwe can safely say that there was no manipulation on the part of Directors.\\\\\\\\n(iii) As to declaration of dividend, dematerialization and purchase of trawler. we feel that\\\\\\\\nthese are part of normal functioning of the company without any prejudice.Dividend\\\\\\\\nand dematerialization was implemented within normal frame work.Purchase of\\\\\\\\ntrawler could not be materilised as Bangladesh Krishi Bank was found reluctant to\\\\\\\\nfinance.Altenatively we decided to go for right issue at the ratio of 2R:1 which is yet\\\\\\\\nto materialize.\\\\\\\\nFrom the above you will kindly appreciate that Directors of the company. who sold\\\\\\\\nshares, did not violate any provision of Bangladesh Securities and Exchange commission.\\\\\\\\nHence it is prayed that Directors and the company may be exonerated from charges.\\\\\\\\u201d\\\\\\\\nUnquote\\\\\\\\nRY, BPMs at Bega aaorers Tats car: ager BraI Dyas @ Vara afapreraecna ATH TW ya, r0s\\\\\\\\xa2\\\\\\\\nR wrfact aaa sees Clare Pfstfaihe asa ofactaca aetor eer fale faa aeea Hee Gferart aa al\\\\\\\\nCRY, Vy at arrears Vahe alee wa fifevaiba ae4 o Baa sera orfage fafe-faaa\\\\\\\\nScrat Gay ATA A Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969 44 Section 22 aa saa stfecat\\\\\\\\naad;\\\\\\\\nTRY, shricaa farapay, fsvfata area s fafe-faan afsrecea Cafes odor Gay, Aferarercad yee,\\\\\\\\nDI ae Grace Bey Bypass Aes wfaoase Gare cw: \\\\\\\\u201cfea Dre, afaorre fom wef\\\\\\\\nBaa, , ecsiftad wracata, coeat fe sreora fet:, wae aOITS Gara AoW Fa Sec, we UfsarAT sat\\\\\\\\nSANSA S AaB;\\\\\\\\nae.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u201cafesacda weit Squa-adtarad ber ee Fferetens\\\\\\\\u201d\\\\\\\\nPhone (PABX) : +88-02-55007131-2 Fax : +88-02-55007106 E-mail : inforwsec. gov.bd Web : www.sec.gov.bd= BANGE ADESH SECU RETEES AND ENE H ANGE \\\\\\\\xa9 OMPMEENS EEN 7\\\\\\\\ni Securities Cammission Bhat ex\\\\\\\\na \\\\\\\\u2018 inti Seana, Sher thee S . &\\\\\\\\n% ry = = \\\\\\\\u2018\\\\\\\\nEs - alt S Wak Sates ait 4\\\\\\\\nPty st\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n(Ordinanee No. NVIL of 1969) 94 Section 22 fa\\\\\\\\nAct. 2000 at Feria) < ave 4\\\\\\\\nAVA BHT ATSAHTE\\\\\\\\nWade ATs\\\\\\\\nS Saw Saar sy wayrets esr frre wefan Baers, ofa cS yo (9) TE\\\\\\\\nbret, cama fee ererora fet: acoicad wrecada TH 2\\\\\\\\xa2 (Ao) THE Trey Cae Gee ATE aa WET\\\\\\\\nCe @ (AS) ae Bret Glaarn aly Sat a am SATS wiles Sew oe (Ae) fare ATM ate\\\\\\\\nWTS aay See oF Sys FASS ALS OMFG /CA- AWS TI ST gat Sars Vs\\\\\\\\nae! fete STS osrby SaMNst SIO,\\\\\\\\noVlof/20e%\\\\\\\\nTa: ARES FAH\\\\\\\\nfrat afaprere\\\\\\\\n> forms wrefi Brera\\\\\\\\nofaprere, fap capris far:\\\\\\\\nart a fa-son (84 war)\\\\\\\\nfawans\\\\\\\\nTATE FR-2Q\\\\\\\\nfesatay, Tara\\\\\\\\nDIST |\\\\\\\\neet er arerora fafoe\\\\\\\\nacafras afaprere, fap caprfa fa:\\\\\\\\nart a fa-Son (82% Sar)\\\\\\\\nTATE A-22\\\\\\\\nfesatnan, warty\\\\\\\\nDIFT |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\xa9.

In an order dated March 1, the Commission En Banc directed PawisngPinoy to immediately cease and desist from engaging in the unlawful or unauthorized solicitation, offer and/or sale of securities without the necessary license and approval from the SEC.  The SEC also ordered PawisngPinoy, its owners, operators, representatives, agents, and promoters to cease their internet presence. They were likewise prohibited from transacting any business involving funds in its depository banks, and from transferring, disposing, or conveying any related assets to ensure the preservation of the assets of the investors.   The Commission issued the cease and desist order after its Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD) found PawisngPinoy to have been soliciting from the public investments ranging from P2,000 to P10,000, in exchange for a guaranteed passive income of P4,500 to P20,500 within five to six days. The group has also been promising investors P500 to P2,500 in bonuses.  The scheme involves the sale and offer of securities to the public in the form of investment contracts, whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits primarily from the efforts of others, according to the SEC.  Section 8 of Republic Act No. 8799, or The Securities Regulation Code (SRC), provides that securities shall not be sold or offered for sale or distribution within the Philippines, without a registration statement duly filed with and approved by the SEC.  \\\\\\\\u201c[T]his Commission finds, and so holds, that PawisngPinoy is unlawfully engaged in the sale and/or offer of unregistered securities in the form of investment contract, because it has no license to carry out the same,\\\\\\\\u201d the Commission En Banc held.   The investments received from the public will allegedly be used for PawisngPinoy\\\\\\\\u2019s rice trading business, construction and medical supplies distribution, and real estate operations, which the EIPD found to be non-existent.   \\\\\\\\u201cThe EIPD was able to show that the investment scheme of PawisngPinoy involves the pooling of the money invested by its investors in rice trading, construction and Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway, 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  medical supplies trading, real estate development, and buying and selling of gold jewelries which are actually, which was utilized to satisfy and pay the guaranteed returns of its existing investors,\\\\\\\\u201d the order read.   \\\\\\\\u201cThis is the common enterprise that is being sustained by the investments received by PawisngPinoy, although the same is masked by a product distribution, real estate, and jewelry business which, in reality, does not exist.\\\\\\\\u201d  The EIPD also found PawisngPinoy to have been using a fake Certificate of Filing of Amendment of Bylaws, to make it appear as if it has been authorized by the SEC to solicit investments from the public.   PawisngPinoy is not registered with the Commission as a corporation or partnership. Accordingly, it cannot secure a secondary license needed for the issuance of securities for public offering, pursuant to the SRC.   The Commission has warned the public against dealing with or investing in PawisngPinoy as early as January 11 through an advisory posted on the SEC website.   \\\\\\\\u201c[T]his Commission holds that the act of PawisngPinoy in selling/offering unregistered securities operates as a fraud to the public which, if unrestrained, will likely cause grave or irreparable injury or prejudice to the investing public,\\\\\\\\u201d the cease and desist order read.

In an order dated March 1, the Commission En Banc directed RGS World to immediately cease and desist from engaging in the unlawful or unauthorized solicitation, offer and/or sale of securities until it has filed the requisite registration statement and secured the necessary approval from the SEC.  RGS World, its directors Rodolfo Garcia Salarda, Jr., Leah Pasis Salarda, Rodelyn Balico Salarda, Henje Noble Cuadra, and Ryan C. Ladoing, as well as its officers, operators, representatives, salesmen, and agents have been ordered to cease their internet presence relating to their investment scheme.   The company and its directors have likewise been prohibited from transacting any business involving funds in its depository banks, and from transferring, disposing, or conveying any related assets to ensure the preservation of the assets of the investors.   The Commission issued the cease and desist order after investigations by the SEC Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD), SEC Bacolod Extension Office (BacEO), and SEC Iloilo Extension Office showed that RGS World has been selling and/or offering compensation plans worth P1,000 to P20,000, with promised returns ranging from P3,500 to P80,000.   To entice prospective investors into their scheme, directors, agents, promoters, and existing investors of the Bacolod City-based company were found to be using their Facebook accounts to show photos of investors who have allegedly received their payouts.   Investors were also promised non-monetary returns such as frozen goods and rice, as well as additional bonuses, incentives and products by referring or recruiting more members.   Moreover, the company distributed products such as soap, liniment oils, rice, eggs, and other poultry products, to disguise its investment scheme as a legitimate distribution business.

However, BacEO has already received complaints from numerous investors claiming that they have not received the profits or products promised to them.   The scheme involves the sale and offer of securities to the public in the form of investment contracts, whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits primarily from the efforts of others, according to the SEC.  Section 8 of Republic Act No. 8799, or The Securities Regulation Code (SRC), provides that securities shall not be sold or offered for sale or distribution within the Philippines, without a registration statement duly filed with and approved by the SEC.  \\\\\\\\u201c[T]his Commission finds, and so holds, that RGS World is unlawfully engaged in the sale and/or offer of unregistered securities in the form of investment contract, because it has no license to carry out the same,\\\\\\\\u201d the order read.     RGS World is a duly registered corporation with the Commission. However, it has never secured a secondary license from the Commission as issuer of securities or broker dealer nor registered any securities for public offering pursuant to the SRC.   Records from the Food and Drug Administration also show that RGS World and its affiliated entities have no license to operate a distribution business, according to the EIPD.   \\\\\\\\u201c[T]he Commission holds that the act of RGS World in selling/offering unregistered securities operates as a fraud to the public which, if unrestrained, will likely cause grave or irreparable injury or prejudice to the investing public,\\\\\\\\u201d the Commission En Banc said.

The SEC likewise directed the company from transacting any business involving funds in its depository banks and from transferring, disposing, or conveying any related assets to ensure the preservation of the assets for the benefit of affected investors.   The SEC issued the cease and desist order after finding that AlphanetWorld has been selling and/or offering investment packages priced from P4,750 to P19,000 in exchange for NWorld products and a guaranteed monthly return of up to P127,000.

In a decision dated November 2, 2021, the Commission En Banc denied the Memorandum of Appeal filed by Familyhan for lack of merit.   The SEC Corporate Governance and Finance Department (CGFD) issued the revocation order on April 13, 2021 after finding that Familyhan committed three violations of SEC Memorandum Circular No. 18, Series of 2019 (MC 18), which provides for the Prohibition on Unfair Debt Collection Practices of Financing Companies and Lending Companies.   The company was also found to have committed eight violations of Republic Act No. 3765, or the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), in relation to SEC Memorandum Circular No. 7, Series of 2011 (MC 7), which outlines the rules on the Implementation of the TILA to Enhance Loan Transaction Transparency.   Familyhan filed a motion for reconsideration of the said order, which the CGFD denied for lack of merit in a resolution dated June 18, 2021.   \\\\\\\\u201c[T]he Commission holds that the number of violations that Appellant Familyhan committed indicates and affirms the gravity and seriousness thereof because it shows a conscious and deliberate disregard of the provisions of the said circulars, which the Commission is mandated to implement,\\\\\\\\u201d the Commission En Banc decision read.  \\\\\\\\u201cThis warrants the revocation of its CA and the Commission, thus, sees no compelling reason to disturb the finding and the decision of the CGFD.\\\\\\\\u201d  Familyhan violated the prohibition on unfair debt collection practices when it contacted persons in the debtor\\\\\\\\u2019s contact list other than those named as guarantors or co-makers of the loan agreement, according to the CGFD.   Meanwhile, Familyhan violated MC 7 when it failed to disclose the net proceeds of the loan to its borrowers. Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  In its Memorandum of Appeal, Familyhan argued that it complied with the TILA, as the complainants were provided with all required information in their respective loan agreements.   The company also claimed that it did not violate MC 18 when it sent demand letters to persons other than the borrowers, as its purpose was to inquire about the latter\\\\\\\\u2019s whereabouts.   The Commission En Banc, however, maintained that MC 18 clearly states that the act of \\\\\\\\u201ccontacting the person in the borrower\\\\\\\\u2019s contact list other than those who were named as guarantors or co-makers shall also constitute unfair debt collection practice.\\\\\\\\u201d   Likewise, the Commission En Banc agreed that Familyhan\\\\\\\\u2019s loan contracts did not state the net proceeds of the loan to its borrowers, such that they had to manually compute for the net proceeds of their respective loan agreements, violating MC 7 in relation to the TILA.   Further, the Commission En Banc noted that Familyhan admitted to having committed the aforementioned violations when it paid their corresponding penalties.   \\\\\\\\u201cThe grant of authority to the Commission to revoke the CA of lending or financing companies who violate the law, rules, and regulations is justified by the fact that a license is a mere privilege, and the enjoyment thereof is conditioned on the grantee\\\\\\\\u2019s full and continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations,\\\\\\\\u201d the Commission En Banc ruled.

In a joint operation on February 12, the combined forces of the SEC Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD) and the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) successfully implemented a warrant to search, seize and examine computer data in Cashtrees Lending Corporation\\\\\\\\u2019s office in Pasig City.  The Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 46 issued the search warrant against Cashtrees Lending for misuse of device penalized under Section 4(a)(5)(i)(ii) of Republic Act No. 10275, or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, in operating unregistered online lending applications in violation of Republic Act No. 9474, or the Lending Company Regulation Act (LCRA).  The onsite digital forensic examination on the seized devices showed that the employees of Cashtrees Lending operated online lending applications such as Happylend, Rush Loan, Easy Money, Good Pocket, Dummy Loan, Lucky Star, Swipe Cash, 365 Cash, Home Peso, Mega Loan, Treecash and Goldpeso.  Cashtrees Lending is registered as a corporation and holds a certificate of authority to operate as a lending company. It operates registered online lending platforms such as Happylend, Creditcash and Cashmore.   However, majority of the online lending applications operated by Cashtrees Lending were unregistered. These include Goodpocket, Easymoney, 365 Cash and Rushloan, which have been the subject of cease and desist orders issued by the Commission.  Following the digital forensic examination, the PNP-ACG arrested 46 employees, including the manager of Cashtrees Lending for violating the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 and the LCRA.   On February 13, the SEC-EIPD and PNP-ACG filed with the Department of Justice an inquest complaint against the arrested employees of Cashtrees Lending for violating Section 4(a)(5)(i)(ii) of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 and the LCRA in relation to Section 6 of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.   The SEC has been receiving numerous complaints against online lending applications (OLAs) for various violations of the LCRA and for abusive debt collection practices in violation of SEC Memorandum Circular No. 18, Series of 2019, which provides for the Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  Prohibition on Unfair Debt Collection Practices of Financing Companies and Lending Companies.  In response, the Commission created a task force to handle complaints involving online lending operators and to take the appropriate measures to stop lending companies and their operators from engaging in abusive practices and activities.  The task force closely coordinates with other law enforcement agencies such as the PNP-ACG and the National Bureau of Investigation to crack down on illegal online lending applications.  The SEC regularly monitors lending and financing companies for their compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, as it seeks to protect borrowers from abusive, unethical, and illegal lenders.  To date, the Commission has canceled the licenses of 36 financing/lending companies due to various violations of applicable rules and regulations.  It has also revoked the certificate of registration of a total of 2,081 lending companies for their failure to secure the requisite certificate of authority, pursuant to the LCRA.

8888-8141;8818-5478  14 February 2022  SEC REVOKES SUHAIL MEDICAL CENTER\\\\\\\\u2019S INCORPORATION OVER ILLEGAL INVESTMENT SCHEME  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has canceled the corporate registration of Suhail Medical Center, Inc. for its unauthorized solicitation of investments from the public.   In an order dated February 3, the SEC Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD) found that the company headed by Jesser T. Cordova has been publicly offering and selling securities without the necessary secondary license from the Commission.  In doing so, Suhail Medical Center committed an ultra vires act under Section 44 of Republic Act No. 11232, or the Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines.   The company\\\\\\\\u2019s activities also constituted serious misrepresentation as to what it can do, to the great prejudice of or damage to the general public, a ground for the revocation of a corporation\\\\\\\\u2019s certificate of registration under Presidential Decree No. 902-A, according to the order.   The Commission has warned the public against investing in Suhail Medical Center as early as November 16, 2021 through an advisory.    Suhail Medical Center has been soliciting investments from the public worth P1.06 million for the co-ownership seat to its supposed hospital in Calamba, Laguna. Investors also have the option to purchase half a seat worth P550,000.   The company promised investors returns in the form of quarterly revenues based on the hospital\\\\\\\\u2019s performance, free laboratories and check-ups for the co-owners and their next of kin, as well as lifetime income.   Suhail Medical Center\\\\\\\\u2019s scheme involved securities, particularly an investment contract, whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits primarily from the efforts of others, according to the EIPD.   As a form of security, investment contracts must be registered with the SEC before they can be sold or offered within the Philippines, pursuant to Section 8 of Republic Act No. 8799, or the Securities Regulation Code. Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary Breezeway 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  However, records of the Commission show that Suhail Medical Center is not authorized to solicit investments from the public as it has not secured the prior registration and/or license for such activities.   The EIPD further noted that Suhail Medical Center\\\\\\\\u2019s promised profits and returns would be derived from the investments of new member-investors, not its actual operations.   \\\\\\\\u201cNecessarily, this scheme is unsustainable as it must rely on a continuous inflow of new investors in order to make pay-outs to earlier investors, all the more made glaring considering that it has no actual operations yet to speak of,\\\\\\\\u201d the order read.   Further, the EIPD has secured certification from the Health Facilities and Services Regulatory Bureau of the Department of Health stating that there was no license issued to a certain Suhail Medical Center located in Calamba, Laguna, nor was there an application for such health facility.   \\\\\\\\u201cWherefore, for violation of Section 44 of the Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines (R.A. 11232) in relation to Sections 8.1 and 28.1 of the Securities Regulation Code, P.D. 902-A and Section 179(j) of the RCCP, the Certificate of Incorporation and the registration of Suhail Medical Center, Inc., as a corporation, is hereby REVOKED,\\\\\\\\u201d the order read.
