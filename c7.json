Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) initiated Adjudication proceedings against Alchemist Infra Realty Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Alchemist\\\\\\\\u2019) and its present and past directors namely Mr Brij Mohan Mahajan (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Brij\\\\\\\\u2019), Mr Narayan Madhav kumar (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Narayan\\\\\\\\u2019), Mr Balvir Singh (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Balvir\\\\\\\\u2019) and Mr Chandra Sekhar Chauhan (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Chandra\\\\\\\\u2019, and all aforesaid entities are collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019) as it was alleged that the schemes of Alchemist were of the nature of Collective Investment Scheme (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018CIS\\\\\\\\u2019), which required registration from SEBI under Section 11AA of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u2019), so that by operating as an Page 2 of 34  unregistered CIS, Noticees allegedly violated provisions of Section 12(1B) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 3 of the SEBI(Collective Investment Scheme) Regulations, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018CIS Regulations, 1999\\\\\\\\u2019). 2. In the said matter, SEBI had also passed order dated June 21, 2013 directing Alchemist to not collect any money from investors or carry out any scheme identified as CIS in the aforesaid order, and directing the Noticees, interalia, to wind up existing CIS schemes, refund the money to investors and restraining them from accessing the securities market. 3. Alchemist being aggrieved by the said order filed an appeal in the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SAT\\\\\\\\u2019), wherein by an order dated July 23, 2013, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT upheld the findings of SEBI and allowed Alchemist 18 months' time to refund the money collected from the investors. Alchemist being aggrieved by the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT dated July 23, 2013 filed a Civil Appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SC\\\\\\\\u2019). This appeal was dismissed as withdrawn by an order dated September 5, 2014 by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SC, so that the order of SEBI holding that the operations of Alchemist as a CIS without obtaining a certificate of registration were illegal and the consequential direction to stop the scheme and refund the amount to the investors became final. Based on the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT dated July 23, 2013, Alchemist filed an application dated January 22, 2015 seeking extension of time in order to complete the process of refund and also sought permission to circulate an information memorandum in terms of Regulation 73 of the CIS Regulations, 1999. This application was rejected by SEBI by an order dated May 27, 2015 declining the request for extension of time and also refusing permission to circulate an information memorandum. Alchemist challenged the order dated May 27, 2015 passed by SEBI before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in Appeal No. 298 of 2015. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT by an order dated June 15, 2015 set aside the order of SEBI dated May 27, 2015 and directed SEBI to verify the claim made by Alchemist regarding refund to investors, and further directed Alchemist Page 3 of 34  to furnish the particulars demanded by SEBI vide its various letters for the purpose of verifying the said claim. 4. Thereafter, Alchemist again made a fresh representation dated August 7, 2015 seeking permission to circulate an information memorandum under Regulation 73 of the CIS Regulations, 1999. Further, pursuant to the requisite information submitted by Alchemist, SEBI appointed an independent auditor dated August 6, 2015 in order to verify the payments made by the appellant to the investors. Since the appellant was not cooperating with the auditor, SEBI issued a show cause notice dated November 20, 2015 to show cause as to why the order of SEBI dated May 27, 2015 should not be revived. Based on reply submitted by Alchemist, an interim audit report dated May 28, 2016 submitted to SEBI and other extenuating circumstances, vide order dated June 14, 2016, the WTM rejected the application of Alchemist seeking further extension of time to implement the SEBI's order of June 21, 2013 for refund of money to the investors and rejected the request to circulate an information memorandum under Regulation 73 of the CIS Regulations, 1999. Alchemist being aggrieved by the said order filed appeal, so that the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT vide order dated August 13, 2019 upheld the order of SEBI dated June 14, 2016.  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 5. The undersigned was appointed as Adjudicating Officer conveyed vide communique dated January 28, 2020 under Section 19 read with Section 15-I(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 3 of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as 'Adjudication Rules') to inquire into and adjudge under Section 15D(a) of the SEBI Act, 1992, the violation of Section 12(1B) of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 3 of the CIS Regulations, 1999 alleged to have been committed by the Noticees. Page 4 of 34  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 6. A common Show Cause Notice (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) dated February 14, 2020 was issued to the Noticees under the provisions of Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against the Noticees and penalty, if any, be not imposed on them under the provisions of Section 15D(a) of the SEBI Act, 1992 for the alleged violation by the Noticees. The allegations in the SCN are given below: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 SEBI, upon receipt of an anonymous letter on May 25, 2011 alleging that AIRL was operating scheme, plans and mobilizing funds from investors/public, conducted examination in the dealings of AIRL to find out if the activities of AIRL would fall within the ambit of the CIS Regulations or not. On the basis of the said examination, an SCN dated November 20, 2012 was issued to the Noticees alleging that they had been running an unregistered collective investment scheme (CIS) and, therefore, have violated the provisions of Section 11AA read with Section 12(1B) of SEBI Act further read with Regulation 3 of CIS Regulations. Whole Time Member of SEBI (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018WTM)), after examining the material available on record and the replies submitted by the Noticees, passed an order dated June 21, 2013 (Annexure 3), wherein he inter-alia issued the following directions: \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI would initiate prosecution proceedings under section 24 and adjudication proceedings under Chapter VI of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 against Alchemist Infra Realty and its directors\\\\\\\\u201d On the basis of the said direction, adjudication proceedings have been initiated against the Noticees by SEBI. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 During the course of examination, SEBI, vide letter dated August 8, 2011, sought information regarding its operations from AIRL. AIRL, vide letter dated September 15, 2011 (Annexure 4), furnished copies of certain documents and submitted that its activities did not fall under CIS. Page 5 of 34  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 As the information furnished by AIRL was incomplete in terms of the information sought, SEBI sent another letter to AIRL on November 04, 2011 advising it to submit complete information. In reply to the said letter, AIRL, vide another letter dated December 6, 2011 (Annexure 5), made further submissions wherein AIRL, inter-alia, submitted that it did not issue any advertisement or circular or any brochure for its business transactions, there was no instalment plan. AIRL further submitted that, as per its business model, it was not possible for the purchasers to. purchase land from AIRL without taking the development facility offered by it. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Thereafter, SEBI, vide another letter dated January 31, 2012, again advised: AIRL to provide the details of the development work being done, the details of land holdings, copies of sale deeds executed by it etc. In response to the said letter, AIRL, vide its letter dated March 1, 2012 (Annexure 6), inter-alia stated that AIRL agrees to supervise the land and provide its services to those who seek the same for a fee payable to it. Further, AIRL also submitted that some of the land sold by it were being used for agricultural purposes in which AIRL was entitled to receive the proceeds of farming etc. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 SEBI, vide another letter dated April 18, 2012, again advised AIRL to provide copies of registered sale deeds, filled up application forms etc. and also to explain the discrepancies observed in the information furnished in its letter dated March 1, 2012 vis-a-vis earlier information furnished by it. AIRL, vide letter dated April 30, 2012 (Annexure 7), furnished some more information. Vide its letter dated May 23, 2012 (Annexure 8), AIRL submitted copies of some certificates of properties issued to the purchasers of land. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is observed from the records made available by AIRL that any person, willing to purchase land from AIRL has to apply in a prescribed application form along with the application fee. AIRL has sole discretion to either accept or reject the application. Once the application is accepted, the buyer would enter into a special power of attorney in the name of an employee of AIRL to enable him to exercise all the rights and obligations of the applicant with respect to the Page 6 of 34  purchase and management of the plot. Pursuant to this, on behalf of the buyer, the said employee of AIRL will enter into an indenture agreement and/or conveyance deed with AIRL. The purchasers of land would also enter into an agreement with AIRL, called the \\\\\\\\u2018Supervision Agreement\\\\\\\\u2019 to develop, work, control and supervise the said land on behalf of the purchasers for a particular period of time and a management fee was also being charged by AIRL for performing the task. Thereafter, the deed of conveyance is retained by AIRL and only a Certificate of Property is issued to the purchaser by AIRL, in which the expected value of the said piece of land after the expiry of a fixed period of time is also mentioned. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 On examination of the material available on record, SEBI concluded that AIRL was operating a CIS in terms of SEBI Act as discussed hereunder. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Section 11AA(2) of the SEBI Act, lists four ingredients/ characteristics that are required to be satisfied for declaring an activity of an entity as CIS. The relevant text of the said provisions of law is being reproduced herein below: SEBI Act Collective investment scheme. 11AA. (1) Any scheme or arrangement which satisfies the conditions referred to in sub-section (2) shall be a collective investment scheme: (2) Any scheme or arrangement made or offered by any company under which,\\\\\\\\u2014 (i) the contributions, or payments made by the investors, by whatever name called, are pooled and utilized for the purposes of the scheme or arrangement; (ii) the contributions or payments are made to such scheme or arrangement by the investors with a view to receive profits, income, produce or property, whether movable or immovable, from such scheme or arrangement; Page 7 of 34  (iii) the property, contribution or investment forming part of scheme or arrangement, whether identifiable or not, is managed on behalf of the investors; (iv) the investors do not have day-to-day control over the management and operation of the scheme or arrangement. (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), any scheme or arrangement\\\\\\\\u2014 (i) made or offered by a co-operative society registered under the Co-operative Societies Act, 1912 (2 of 1912) or a society being a society registered or deemed to be registered under any law relating to co-operative societies for the time being in force in any State; (ii) under which deposits are accepted by non-banking financial companies as defined in clause (f) of section 45-1 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934); (iii) being a contract of insurance to which the Insurance Act, 1938 (4 of 1938), applies; (iv) providing for any Scheme, Pension Scheme or the Insurance Scheme framed under the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 (19 of 1952); (v) under which deposits are accepted under section 58A of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956); (vi) under which deposits are accepted by a company declared as a Nidhi or a mutual benefit society under section 620A of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956); (vii) falling within the meaning of Chit business as defined in clause (da) of section 2 of the Chit Fund Act, 1982 (40 of 1982), (viii) under which contributions made are in the nature of Subscription to a mutual fund; Shall not be a collective investment scheme. Page 8 of 34  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 From material available on record and as mentioned above, it is alleged that the activities of AIRL fall within the four ingredients/characteristics of CIS in the manner mentioned below: l. Section 11AA(2)(i): Contributions or payments made by the investors, by whatever name called, are pooled and utilized for the purposes of the scheme or arrangement. a. The first condition to be satisfied is accepting payments from investors and pooling and utilizing the same for the purpose of the scheme or arrangement. b. AIRL is alleged to be accepting money from investors in the form of payment for land and its development. AIRL has contended that it was not running any scheme which was in the nature of CIS. In this regard, AIRL has submitted a few application forms of various investors to SEBI. Upon perusal of one such application forms as received from one Mr. Prakash Mondal, it has been observed that the development tenure is specified as \"Plan B, -6 years\". Therefore, it is alleged that AIRL had floated some plans based on which buyers were applying. Thus, it is alleged that, in this way, AIRL was collecting/pooling money under the said \\\\\\\\u2018plans\\\\\\\\u2019. However, AIRL had denied having any kind of plans/schemes. c. The following points have further been observed from the filled up application forms referred above: i. The applicant has to apply for an undivided interest in the land situated in the state of Madhya Pradesh. However, the area of land, location of land or the price of land have not been mentioned anywhere in the application form. ii. The application can be made for a minimum amount of Rs 1000/- & in multiples of Rs 1000/-. Page 9 of 34  iii. Under category F, AIRL allots immovable property in consideration to the amount paid to the company, and such land can be leased out to the company under 'Fixed term tenancy Agreement. To enter this agreement minimum land holding should be of 300 sq ft (if not specified otherwise) and additional holdings should be in multiples of 100 sq. ft. Presently the lease amount is fixed at Rs 3300/- per annum for a period of 3 years for an area of 300 sq. ft. The amount will be increased proportionately in accordance with the land holdings. This amount will be made available to the \\\\\\\\u2018allottee' in equated monthly instalments spread through the lease period. d. Similarly, it is observed from the indenture also, signed between AIRL and the purchaser (Mr. Prakash Mondal), that the area of land being purchased by the customer has not been mentioned. Wherever the share of the customer is mentioned, it has always been denoted as proportionate undivided interest. Indenture states the total area of land (total 905.016 Kanal) owned by AIRL at Behanta & Tila, Tehsil Kolaras, District Shivpuri (Madhya Pradesh). e. In the same manner, special Power of Attorney, has to be signed by all the applicants at the time of making the application. From the special power of attorney, it is noted that it is a pre-printed document that carries the name of one Mr. Gagnish Arora, an authorized representative of AIRL. The power of attorney is granted in favour of Mr. Arora enabling him to exercise all the rights and obligations of the applicant with respect to the purchase and management of the plot. Also, it is noted that the special power of attorney only carries plot measurement as 1000 sq. ft./sq. yd. (exact unit not specified). f. AIRL has also provided a copy of conveyance deed of Mr. Prakash Mondal which states that out of 0.81 Hectare, 0.0372 hectares or 372 sq. m has been purchased. Page 10 of 34  g. Also, the indenture states that the purchaser shall not be entitled to claim division and/or partition of the proportionate undivided interest and shall continue to hold and enjoy the same with its co-owners without any objection. h. It is observed from the Balance Sheet of AIRL for the year ended March 31, 2011 that an amount of Rs 203.11 Crore has been shown as Advance against land and Rs 884.57 Crore as advance against development charges. The corresponding figures for the year ended March 31, 2010 were Rs 83.97 Crore & Rs 365.44 Crore, respectively. In view of this, it is alleged that the advances against land and development charges are nothing but deposits taken from investors. Therefore, it is alleged that AIRL has in total mobilized funds to the tune of Rs. 1,087 crores as on March 2011. i. In view of the above, it is alleged that AIRL was collecting money from investors, purchasing large plots of land and developing the same. At the same time, AIRL was not allotting a specific part of the plot to the investor and only an undivided interest is being assigned to each investor. In view of this, it is alleged that through its activities of sale and development of land, the AIRL was accepting \"contributions\" from customers/ investors, for collective utilization with the aim of purchasing land and developing the same without allotting any specific part of the land to the investors and merely mentioning as undivided interest in the agreements. j. Thus it is alleged that the scheme fulfils the first condition as specified in Section 11AA(2)(i) of the SEBI Act. ll. Section 11AA(2)(ii): Receiving of profit by investors: a. Clause (ii) of Section 11AA(2) of the SEBI Act requires that the investor must be a recipient of any one of the benefits expressed threat i.e. either Page 11 of 34  profit or income or produce or property, from the scheme or arrangement. b. In this regard, it is alleged that each customer/investor of AIRL is a recipient of agricultural land i.e. property/ profit over property. c. Further, it is also observed from the Certificate of Property issued to the purchaser by AIRL, the expected value of the said piece of land after the expiry of a fixed period of time has also been mentioned. d. It is, therefore, alleged that each customer/investor of AIRL is a recipient of one of the benefits contemplated under clause (ii) namely property/profit over property. In view of the above, it is alleged that AIRL was satisfying the second condition of a CIS as prescribed in section 11AA(2)(ii) of the SEBI Act. lll. Section 11AA(2)(iii) & (iv): Management on behalf of investors and investors do not have day to day control over the management and operation of the scheme or arrangement. a. AIRL, in its letter dated September 15, 2011 (Annexure 4), has submitted that the applicant/buyer/purchaser enters into a supervision agreement with AIRL wherein AIRL agrees to develop, work, control and supervise the land for a fixed period of time and the applicant/buyer/purchaser hands over such land to AIRL for a management fee. b. AIRL submitted that, in terms of the Supervision Agreement, the applicant/buyer/ purchaser has to execute a Special Power of Attorney in favour of the nominee of AIRL, who is one of the authorised representative of AIRL, to enable the nominee to take necessary steps in respect of the development, working and supervision of the land. Further, the term of the supervision agreement can be extended on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon by the applicant by making a request six months before the expiry of the agreement; Page 12 of 34  c. AIRL further submitted that, in terms of the supervision agreement, it develops works and supervises the land in such a manner so as to ensure that the applicant/buyer/purchaser may receive the expected and estimated value of the land after the expiry of the fixed period of time.It is observed from the application forms of one Mr. Radha Gobind Das & another Ms. Abha Santara that both the customers had paid Rs 2 lakhs each for an area of 2000 sq. ft. but, upon perusal of the Supervision agreements signed in favour of AIRL by both the abovementioned persons it is observed that in the case of Mr. Radha Gobind Das, the management fees charged is Rs. 46,500/- and for Abha Santara, the fee charged is Rs. 1,48,500/- as development charges. AIRL has not specified how the development charges were being calculated, or for that matter, why in one case out of the application money of Rs 2 lakhs the development charges were being shown as Rs 1,48,500 i.e. around 75% of the application amount. d. Further, from the documents submitted by AIRL, it is observed that some of the buyers of the land are based at a place different from the place of land. For example, Mr. Prakash Mondal is from 24 Parganas in the state of West Bengal; however, the land under question is situated in Madhya Pradesh. It is also observed that the buyers have executed special power of attorney in favour of Mr. Gagnish Arora, an employee of AIRL, based in Noida. The special power of attorney holder has signed the conveyance deed on behalf of the buyers. The witnesses in these conveyance deeds are common i.e. Mr. Mohan Sharma & Mr. Raghuvir Batham. The conveyance deed is signed by Mr. Satish Mehta on behalf of AIRL and Mr. Gagnish Arora on behalf of purchasers. Both Mr. Satish Mehta and Mr. Gagnish Arora are employees of AIRL. It is observed that conveyance deed is stamped in the name of AIRL, as the seller and Mr. Page 13 of 34  Gagnish Arora as the buyer even though Mr. Gagnish Arora is only the special power of attorney holder and not the buyer. e. Therefore, it is alleged that the purchaser is not in a position to control or supervise the property owned by him. It is further alleged that it is practically impossible for him to visit the land purchased by him, even to determine whether or not AIRL had carried out its promise/ commitment to develop the land on his behalf, even merely on account of the expenses involved in travelling from the place where he ordinarily resides, to the place where the land is situated. f. Further, AIRL has contended that it does not manage its agricultural land sold to investors/customers. During the correspondence AIRL has Stated that it merely \"supervises\" and \"develops\" at the option of its customers/ investors the agricultural piece of land sold to them. g. It is also observed that AIRL, in its letter dated December 06, 2011, has submitted that, as per its business model, it was not possible for the purchasers to purchase land from AIRL without availing of the development facility offered by it. h. The applicant/buyer/purchaser has an option of requesting AIRL to identify a suitable party for purchasing the land and for a consideration to be mutually agreed. If the applicant/buyer/purchaser exercises this option, AIRL promises to facilitate sale by either identifying suitable party to purchase the land or AIRL itself purchases the land on mutually agreed price. i. In view of all the above, it is alleged that, in this arrangement, a customer/investor has practically no accessibility to the agricultural land purchased by him. Further, it is also alleged that it is practically impossible for a customer to carry on agricultural or developmental activities on the land purchased by him. Page 14 of 34  j. In this regard, it is observed from point no. 6(c) and 6(d) of the Supervision agreement that AIRL had the sole discretion regarding the sale of produce out of the plot. AIRL also had the right to avail of the services of agro consultants and experts to evolve own method and mode of maintaining land. k. It is further observed that the basic requirement of agricultural activities which includes irrigation and drainage facilities, along with ancillary inputs perpetually remained under the control of AIRL. In this regard, the supervision agreement states that the customer is not entitled to make any claim in respect of the facilities provided by AIRL on land and that AIRL is entitled to remove all installation and/or facilities upon termination of this agreement unless agreed otherwise. l. Therefore, in view of the above, it is alleged that the agricultural land, purchased by the buyer/purchaser/investor is managed for all the times by AIRL on behalf of the said buyer. m. In view of the above, it is alleged that it is practically impossible for any investors/customers to have a day to day control over the agricultural land purchased by him. Day to day control with the investor/customer is one of the most important tests for concluding whether a scheme is a \"Collective Investment Scheme\" or not. n.  In view of the above, it is alleged that the agricultural land purchased by an investor/customer is managed on his behalf by AIRL and investors/customers do not have day control over the agricultural land purchased by them. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 From the facts and circumstances mentioned above, it is alleged that the Schemes of AIRL are of the nature of CIS, as defined under section 11AA of the SEBI Act which requires registration from SEBI. However, it is alleged that that AIRL has not obtained registration under CIS Regulations from SEBI. Therefore, it is alleged that the Noticees, by operating an unregistered CIS, have violated Page 15 of 34  the provisions of Section 12(1B) of the SEBI Act read with Regulation 3 of the CIS Regulations. 7. The SCN was sent via Speed Post Acknowledgement Due (SPAD) to the Noticees. The details of delivery of SCN and further communication with each of the Noticees are as follows: Alchemist and Chandra The SCNs could not be delivered via SPAD to Alchemist and Chandra. SEBI Indore Local Office was requested to deliver SCN to Chandra through affixture. Vide emails dated July 22, 2020 and July 23, 2020, Indore Local Office informed that SCN could not be delivered by way of affixture to Chandra because of restrictions due to COVID pandemic. Further, SEBI Northern Regional Office was requested to deliver SCN to Alchemist and Chandra through affixture. Thereafter, SCN was delivered via affixture as per Affixture Report dated March 13, 2020. No reply to the SCN was received from Alchemist and Chandra as per the records. Further, vide letter dated November 12, 2020, the two Noticees were granted final opportunity to submit reply to the SCN by November 26, 2020 and were granted an opportunity of personal hearing on December 01, 2020. The said letter dated November 12, 2020 was delivered via SPAD to Alchemist and also via affixture as per Affixture report dated November 28, 2020, to Alchemist and Chandra. No communication was received from Alchemist and Chandra as per the records. Brij The SCN was delivered via SPAD to Brij. No reply to the SCN was received as per the records. Further, vide letter dated November 12, 2020, Brij was granted final opportunity to submit reply to the SCN by November 26, 2020 and was granted opportunity of personal hearing on December 01, 2020. The hearing was conducted on scheduled date, so that Brij appeared in person at SEBI Chandigarh Local Office and requested for extension of time for filing written submission to the SCN, while no additional hearing was sought. Acceding to the said request, Page 16 of 34  Noticee was granted time till December 08, 2020 to make the submissions. Hearing minutes are on record. Vide email dated December 09, 2020, Brij requested for time of two weeks for making submissions. However, no reply was received till date as per the records.  Narayan and Balvir The SCN was not delivered to the two Noticees, i.e. Narayan and Balvir, via SPAD. Thereafter, SEBI Chandigarh Local Office was requested to serve the SCN via hand delivery/ affixture on Narayan and Balvir. Vide email dated July 22, 2020, SEBI Chandigarh Local Office informed that SCN could not be served on the two Noticees via affixture as they were not found at the addresses provided. Further, SCN was served on the two Noticees by way of publication dated August 10, 2020. No reply to the SCN was received as per the records. Thereafter, Narayan and Balvir were granted final opportunity to submit reply to the SCN by 14 days from the date of publication and were granted an opportunity of personal hearing on October 05, 2020 by way of publication dated September 16, 2020. I note that no communication was received from Narayan and Balvir as per records.  8. I note that despite the SCN and hearing notices having been duly served upon the Noticees as per Rule 7 of the Adjudication Rules, they have failed to submit any reply to the SCN till the date of this order. Further, the Noticees except Brij also failed to appear for personal hearing as granted to them. In this context, I would like to rely upon the observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Classic Credit Ltd. vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 68 of 2003 decided on December 08, 2006) wherein it, inter alia, observed that - \".......the appellants did not file any reply to the second show- cause notice. This being so, it has to be presumed that the charges alleged against them in the show-cause notice were admitted by them.\\\\\\\\u201d 9. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT has again in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Others v SEBI (Appeal No. 68 of 2013 decided on February 11, 2014), interalia, observed that \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026.As rightly contended by Mr. Rustomjee, learned senior counsel for Page 17 of 34  respondents, appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted charges levelled against them in the show cause notices.\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d 10. In view of the above, I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been complied with since the SCN and the Hearing Notices thereafter were served to the Noticees as per Rule 7 of the Adjudication Rules, and Noticees were provided sufficient opportunity to submit their reply to the SCN and to appear for hearing.

In a decision dated February 8, the Pasay City Regional Trial Court Branch 111 found Danica E. Gerero, Imelda C. Singh, Diven E. Gerero, Jasvir Singh, and Jaswant Singh guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Republic Act No. 9474, or the Lending Company Regulation Act of 2007 (LCRA).   The court accordingly sentenced each of the respondents, who formed Naurasidhu55 Lending and Trading Corporation as incorporators and directors, to pay a fine of P10,000.  The SEC filed the criminal complaint against the respondents upon finding irregularities in their application for the registration of Naurasidhu55 as a stock corporation, as mandated by the LCRA.  Naurasidhu55 submitted a Certificate of Bank Deposit in the amount of P1 million, purportedly issued by BDO-Two Shopping Center Branch in Pasay City, to comply with the minimum paid-up capital prescribed by the LCRA.  Upon verifying with the bank, however, the SEC found that no such certificate was issued to Naurasidhu55 and no account existed under the name Imelda Singh and number stated in the certificate.   Section 12, paragraph 3(a) of the LCRA penalizes with a fine ranging from P10,000 to P50,000 or imprisonment of not less than 6 months but not more than 10 years or both, any officer, employee or agent of a lending company who shall knowingly and willingly make any statement in any application, report, or document required under the law, which statement is false or misleading with respect to any material fact.   \\\\\\\\u201cAs clearly provided by R.A. 9474, any applicant for authority to operate as a lending company, like Naurasidhu55, must have a minimum paid-up capital of One Million pesos,\\\\\\\\u201d the court noted.  \\\\\\\\u201cHowever, it was sufficiently established that the statement of Naurasidhu55\\\\\\\\u2019s minimum paid-up capital, as contained in the required documents submitted to the SEC, is false, an act punishable under R.A. 9474.\\\\\\\\u201d Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary S-309, 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478   Jasvir Singh, Imelda Singh and Gerero admitted to signing documents pertinent to the registration of Naurasidhu55 with the SEC. However, they supposedly had no knowledge about the falsified document because a certain Gurpreet Singh actually processed the application.   Yet, the court held that \\\\\\\\u201c[b]y submitting their Articles of Incorporation with the required documents to the SEC, they evidently attest, under oath, they have the required minimum paid-up capital of One Million pesos.\\\\\\\\u201d  \\\\\\\\u201cWell-settled is the presumption that a person, before signing a deed or instrument and before acknowledging it before a notary public, have read, understood, and fully knew the contents thereof,\\\\\\\\u201d it added.   The conviction of the incorporators and directors of Naurasidhu55 represents the fifth conviction the SEC has won under a crackdown initiated in 2017 on illegal lenders, including those engaged in \\\\\\\\u201c5-6\\\\\\\\u201d schemes and other usurious practices. In the five cases decided so far, the concerned trial courts found 47 individuals, 22 of whom are foreigners, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating the LCRA.  The SEC, through the Corporate Governance and Finance Department (CGFD), has revoked the primary registration of a total of 2,081 lending companies to date for non-compliance with the LCRA.   In 2020, the Commission also revoked the secondary licenses, or Certificates of Authority to Operate as a Lending Company, of Super Cash Lending Corp., FCash Global Lending, Inc., and Unipeso Lending Company Inc., for committing unfair debt collection practices. The SEC likewise revoked the license of Robocash for its violation of the Financing Company Act.  Furthermore, the SEC ordered four online lending applications, namely CashAB, CashOcean, KwikPeso, and Little Cash, as well as their operators CashAB Lending Corp., Mimosa Credit Ltd., and Zamoya Credit Ltd, to cease operations for lack of authority to operate as a lending or financing company last year. The online lending operators were likewise found to have employed abusive collection practices. \\\\\\\\u201cWe remain steadfast in our crackdown on illegal, predatory and abusive lending practices, in line with our commitment to providing Filipinos secure and effective access to credit,\\\\\\\\u201d SEC Chairperson Emilio B.

It was having membership of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and Inter Connected Stock Exchange (ICSE) before it was expelled from the said exchanges with effect from October 20, 2014.      2. Pursuant to proceedings under the SEBI Intermediaries Regulations, 2008 (\\\\\\\\u201cIntermediaries Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), SEBI vide order dated August 29, 2012 in the matter of Soundcraft Industries Limited, had found the Noticee guilty of violation of the provisions of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (PFUTP Regulations) and SEBI (Stock Brokers and________________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of M/s.

Since the Noticee had kept itself away and had not co-operated with SEBI during the abovementioned proceedings, SEBI vide email dated February 25, 2014 advised BSE and ICSE to examine whether the Noticee fulfilled the \\\\\\\\u2018fit and proper person\\\\\\\\u2019 criteria to continue as a member of the said exchanges and to take suitable action, as deemed fit.  4. Subsequently, BSE vide letter dated October 20, 2014 informed SEBI that the Noticee had been expelled from the membership of BSE with effect from October 20, 2014. It was noted that the same was pursuant to a decision of the Disciplinary Action Committee (DAC) of the BSE, which had noted inter alia the following irregularities by the Noticee: (a) Noticee had submitted fraudulent documents purported to have been signed by a director who had actually resigned from the company as a director. (b)  Board resolution was passed for change in designated directors, without seeking approval of the exchange prior to such change. Further, the documents were signed by the director who was yet to be approved by the Exchange.________________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of M/s. Kolar Sharex Private Limited                                  Page 3 of 16   (c) Noticee had not obtained prior/post approval from SEBI / BSE for change in control of the management. (d) Noticee had provided false and incorrect confirmation with respect to the regulatory action against it and its director. (e) The Noticee had failed to fulfill fit and proper person criteria (f) The Noticee had failed to maintain high standards of ethics, integrity and fairness in its conduct. (g) The debarment order dated December 15, 2010 issued by SEBI against the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s director, Shri Rajkumar Basantani, continued to be in force.  5. Further, ICSE, vide its email dated November 11, 2014 informed SEBI that since the Noticee had been expelled by BSE as a trading member, in terms of notification no. F.NO: 1/26/SE/91 dated August 12, 1991, ICSE would have to treat the Noticee as expelled.  6. Apart from the above, it was noted that various regulatory / enforcement actions had been by SEBI taken against the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s director, Shri Rajkumar C. Basantani, in the past. Shri Rajkumar C. Basantani, apart from being a director of the Noticee, was also a trading member of the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Such regulatory actions against Rajkumar C. Basantani included suspension of certificate of registration as trading________________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of M/s.

Kolar Sharex Private Limited                                  Page 6 of 16   7. In view of the above, it was alleged that the Noticee had violated Regulation 9(a), (b) (c) and (f) of the Stock Brokers Regulations. Considering the same, SEBI initiated proceedings under the Intermediaries Regulations against the Noticee and appointed a Designated Authority (DA) to enquire into the aforesaid violations under Section 12(3) of the SEBI Act, 1992, read with Regulations 27(i), (viii), (xv) and (xvii) of the Stock Brokers Regulations and Regulation 24(1) of the Intermediaries Regulations. The DA issued a show cause notice to the Noticee and upon a consideration of the facts before him, found the Noticee to be in violation of the abovementioned provisions of the Stock Brokers Regulations. Accordingly, the DA, vide his report dated February 28, 2019 (DA Report), submitted under Regulation 27 of the Intermediaries Regulations, recommended that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s certificate of registration as a stock broker be cancelled.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING \\\\\\\\u2013 8. Thereafter, a show cause notice dated March 12, 2019 (\\\\\\\\u201cpost-enquiry SCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to the Noticee, enclosing therewith a copy of the DA Report, calling upon the Noticee to show cause as to why action as recommended by the DA or any other penalty should not be imposed on it in terms of Regulation 28(1) and (2) of the Intermediaries Regulations, as deemed fit by the Competent Authority.  9. The SCN sent to the Noticee returned undelivered. Thereafter, a copy of the SCN was uploaded on the SEBI website under the section \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201cUnserved Summons / Notices that________________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of M/s. Kolar Sharex Private Limited                                  Page 7 of 16   could not be served\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, a notice regarding the SCN was also published in newspapers on August 10, 2020. The said notice in the newspapers also contained an intimation about a personal hearing in the matter which was scheduled on September 23, 2020. However, even after the publication of the notice in newspapers, no response was received from the Noticee. Considering these facts and circumstances, I am constrained to proceed in the matter ex-parte, entirely on the basis of material available on record.   CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS \\\\\\\\u2013 10. I have examined the facts of the case and the charges against the Noticee. I note that that since the Noticee is alleged to have violated Regulations 9 (a), (b) (c) and (f) of the Stock Brokers Regulations, it is imperative to have a look at those provisions. The same are quoted below: \\\\\\\\u201cConditions of registration. 9. Any registration granted by the Board under regulation 6 shall be subject to the following conditions, namely,- (a) the stock broker holds the membership of any stock exchange; (b) he shall abide by the rules, regulations and bye-laws of the stock exchange which are applicable to him; (c) where the stock broker proposes change in control, he shall obtain prior approval of the Board for continuing to act as such after the change; (d) \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026  (e) \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026  (f) he shall at all times abide by the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II;\\\\\\\\u201d________________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of M/s. Kolar Sharex Private Limited                                  Page 8 of 16   11. A perusal of the provisions of Regulation 9(a) shows that any certificate of registration granted to a stock broker by SEBI is subject to the condition that he holds the membership of any stock exchange. I note that this requirement is sine qua non and is absolute in nature. In this regard, I note from records that the Noticee, which was having membership of BSE and ICSE, has already been expelled from the said exchanges with effect from October 20, 2014. Thus, I find that the Noticee does not meet even the basic criteria of holding a certificate of registration from SEBI as a trading member, thereby becoming non-compliant with the provisions of Regulation 9(a) of the Stock Brokers Regulations.  12. Even when a trading member holds a valid certificate of registration from SEBI by virtue of being a member of an exchange, Regulation 9(b) of the Stock Brokers Regulations stipulates that such registration is further subject to the condition that he shall abide by the rules, regulations and bye-laws of the stock exchange which are applicable to him. Further, under Regulation 9(c), it is obligatory that where the stock broker proposes change in control, he shall obtain prior approval of SEBI for continuing to act as such after the change. In this regard, I note from the records that the expulsion of the Noticee from the membership of BSE was pursuant to a proceeding by the DAC of the BSE. From the copy of the relevant extracts of the________________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of M/s. Kolar Sharex Private Limited                                  Page 9 of 16   minutes of the DAC meeting of BSE, held on July, 31, 2014, as available on record, I note that the DAC had noted inter alia the following irregularities by the Noticee: (a)  Board resolution was passed for change in designated directors, without seeking approval of the exchange prior to such change, which was in non-compliance with Rule 257A(iv) of the Rules, Bye-laws and the Regulations of the Exchange and the requirements of the Exchange.  (b) Noticee had not obtained prior/post approval from SEBI / BSE for change in control of the management, which amounted to non-compliance with Rule 257A(iii) of the Rules, Bye-laws and the Regulations of the Exchange and violation of provisions of Stock Brokers Regulations.  13. Apart from the above, the DAC of the BSE had also observed the following: (a) Noticee had submitted fraudulent documents purported to have been signed by a director who had actually resigned from the company as a director. (b)  Documents submitted by the Noticee were signed by the Designated Directors who were yet to be approved by the Exchange. (c) The confirmation given by the Noticee with respect to the regulatory action against it and its directors was false and incorrect. There were many regulatory actions against the Noticee and its directors, which it had failed to report in the confirmation.________________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of M/s. Kolar Sharex Private Limited                                  Page 10 of 16   (d) Vide order dated December 15, 2010 passed in the matter of Kolar Biotech Limited, SEBI had debarred Shri Rajkumar Basantani (a director of Kolar Biotech Limited) from   accessing   the   securities market and prohibit him from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities, directly or indirectly, till all the pending investor grievances against the said company were resolved and the same was reported and confirmed by SEBI. The said debarment continued to be in force. Shri Rajkumar Basantani is also a director of the Noticee. (e) The Noticee had failed to fulfill the fit and proper person criteria. (f) The Noticee failed to maintain high standards of ethics, integrity and fairness in its conduct.  14. Further, I note from the DA Report that as per Action Taken Report (ATR) of SEBI, the following regulatory / enforcement actions have been taken against the Noticee in the past:    Enquiry Proceedings S.

I find that by passing a board resolution for change in designated directors, without seeking approval of the exchange, and by proceeding with change in control of the management withour prior / post approval of SEBI / BSE, as referred to in para 12 above, the Noticee had violated the laws and bye-laws of the BSE, as reported in the abovementioned minutes of the DAC meeting of the BSE. The same amounts to violation of the provisions of Regulation 9 (b) and (c) of the Stock Brokers Regulations by the Noticee. Further, various enforcement actions taken by SEBI against the Noticee clearly show that the Noticee has not been maintaining high standards of integrity, promptitude and fairness in the conduct of its business, and had failed to act with due skill, care and diligence. Further, the various orders passed by SEBI________________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in respect of M/s. Kolar Sharex Private Limited                                  Page 15 of 16   against the Noticee, including the order dated August 29, 2012 as referred to in the opening paragraph of this order, clearly show that it has indulged in manipulation and malpractices and has failed to abide by the provisions of various securities laws applicable to it. These acts of the Noticee have resulted in violation of the provisions of Clauses A (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers prescribed under Schedule II of the Stock Brokers Regulations. This non-adherence to the provisions of Code of Conduct amounts to violation of the provisions of Regulation 9 (f) of the Stock Brokers Regulations. I note that the abovementioned violations are covered under Regulations 27 (i), (viii), (xv) & (xvii) of the Stock Brokers Regulations which make the Noticee liable for action as specified under Chapter V of the Intermediaries Regulations.  17. I note that while the Noticee, by virtue of having been expelled from the membership of BSE and ICSE, has become non-compliant with one of the basic conditions prescribed for holding a certificate of registration from SEBI as a stock brokers, the various enforcement actions taken against it by SEBI over the years are ample proof of the fact that the continuation of the Noticee as a registered intermediary is detrimental to the interest of the securities market and the investors at large.

(\\\\\\\\u201cBitPay\\\\\\\\u201d), a private company based in Atlanta, Georgia, that offers a payment processing\\\\\\\\nsolution for merchants to accept digital currency as payment for goods and services, has agreed to remit\\\\\\\\n$507,375 to settle its potential civil liability for 2,102 apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs.\\\\\\\\nBitPay allowed persons who appear to have been located in the Crimea region of Ukraine, Cuba, North\\\\\\\\nKorea, Iran, Sudan, and Syria to transact with merchants in the United States and elsewhere using digital\\\\\\\\ncurrency on BitPay\\\\\\\\u2019s platform even though BitPay had location information, including Internet Protocol\\\\\\\\n(IP) addresses and other location data, about those persons prior to effecting the transactions.  BitPay\\\\\\\\u2019s\\\\\\\\nsanctions compliance program deficiencies enabled persons in these sanctioned jurisdictions to engage in\\\\\\\\napproximately $129,000 worth of digital currency-related transactions with BitPay\\\\\\\\u2019s merchant customers.\\\\\\\\nThe settlement amount reflects OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s determination that BitPay\\\\\\\\u2019s apparent violations were not\\\\\\\\nvoluntarily self-disclosed and were non-egregious.\\\\\\\\nThis action emphasizes that OFAC obligations apply to all U.S. persons, including those involved in\\\\\\\\nproviding digital currency services.  As part of a risk-based approach, OFAC encourages companies that\\\\\\\\nprovide digital currency services to implement sanctions compliance controls commensurate with their\\\\\\\\nrisk profile.\\\\\\\\nDescription of the Conduct Leading to the Apparent Violations\\\\\\\\nBetween approximately June 10, 2013 and September 16, 2018, BitPay processed 2,102 transactions on\\\\\\\\nbehalf of individuals who, based on IP addresses and information available in invoices, were located in\\\\\\\\nsanctioned jurisdictions (the \\\\\\\\u201cApparent Violations\\\\\\\\u201d).  The Apparent Violations related to BitPay\\\\\\\\u2019s\\\\\\\\npayment processing service, which enables merchants to accept digital currency as payment for goods\\\\\\\\nand services.  Specifically, BitPay received digital currency payments on behalf of its merchant\\\\\\\\ncustomers from those merchants\\\\\\\\u2019 buyers who were located in sanctioned jurisdictions, converted the\\\\\\\\ndigital currency to fiat currency, and then relayed that currency to its merchants.\\\\\\\\nWhile BitPay screened its direct customers\\\\\\\\u2014the merchants\\\\\\\\u2014 against OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s List of Specially\\\\\\\\nDesignated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the \\\\\\\\u201cSDN List\\\\\\\\u201d) and conducted due diligence on them to\\\\\\\\nensure they were not located in sanctioned jurisdictions, BitPay failed to screen location data that it\\\\\\\\nobtained about its merchants\\\\\\\\u2019 buyers.  Specifically, BitPay at times would receive information about\\\\\\\\nthose merchants\\\\\\\\u2019 buyers at the time of the transaction, including a buyer\\\\\\\\u2019s name, address, email address,\\\\\\\\nand phone number.  Beginning in November 2017, BitPay also obtained buyers\\\\\\\\u2019 IP addresses.  However,\\\\\\\\nBitPay\\\\\\\\u2019s transaction review process failed to analyze fully this identification and location data.  As a\\\\\\\\nresult, buyers who, based on those information indicators, were located in Crimea, Cuba, North Korea,\\\\\\\\nIran, Sudan, and Syria were able to make purchases from merchants in the United States and elsewhere\\\\\\\\nusing digital currency on BitPay\\\\\\\\u2019s platform.\\\\\\\\nThis conduct resulted in Apparent Violations of Executive Order 13685 of December 19, 2014,\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u201cBlocking Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to the Crimea\\\\\\\\nRegion of Ukraine\\\\\\\\u201d; the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. \\\\\\\\xa7515.201; the North Korea\\\\\\\\nSanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. \\\\\\\\xa7510.206; the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 312\\\\\\\\nC.F.R. \\\\\\\\xa7560.204; the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. \\\\\\\\xa7538.205 (SSR)1; and the Syrian\\\\\\\\nSanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. \\\\\\\\xa7542.207.\\\\\\\\nPenalty Calculation and General Factors Analysis\\\\\\\\nThe statutory maximum civil monetary penalty applicable in this matter is $619,689,816.  OFAC\\\\\\\\ndetermined that BitPay did not voluntarily self-disclose the Apparent Violations and the Apparent\\\\\\\\nViolations constitute a non-egregious case.  Accordingly, under OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s Economic Sanctions\\\\\\\\nEnforcement Guidelines (\\\\\\\\u201cEnforcement Guidelines\\\\\\\\u201d), the base civil monetary penalty amount applicable\\\\\\\\nin this matter is $2,255,000.  The settlement amount of $507,375 reflects OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s consideration of the\\\\\\\\nGeneral Factors under the Enforcement Guidelines.\\\\\\\\nOFAC determined the following to be aggravating factors:\\\\\\\\n(1) BitPay failed to exercise due caution or care for its sanctions compliance obligations when it\\\\\\\\nallowed persons in sanctioned jurisdictions to transact with BitPay\\\\\\\\u2019s merchants using digital\\\\\\\\ncurrency for approximately five years, even though BitPay had sufficient information to\\\\\\\\nscreen those customers; and\\\\\\\\n(2) BitPay conveyed a total of $128,582.61 in economic benefit to individuals in several\\\\\\\\njurisdictions subject to OFAC sanctions, thereby harming the integrity of those sanctions\\\\\\\\nprograms.\\\\\\\\nOFAC determined the following to be mitigating factors:\\\\\\\\n(1) BitPay had implemented certain sanctions compliance controls as early as 2013, including\\\\\\\\nconducting due diligence and sanctions screening on its merchant customers, and formalized\\\\\\\\nits sanctions compliance program in 2014;\\\\\\\\n(2) BitPay made clear in its training to all employees, including senior management, that BitPay\\\\\\\\nprohibited merchant sign-ups from Cuba, Iran, Syria, Sudan, North Korea, and Crimea, as\\\\\\\\nwell as trade with sanctioned individuals and entities;\\\\\\\\n(3) BitPay is a small business that has not received a penalty notice or Finding of Violation from\\\\\\\\nOFAC in the five years preceding the date of the earliest Apparent Violation;\\\\\\\\n(4) BitPay cooperated with OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s investigation into these Apparent Violations; and\\\\\\\\n(5) BitPay has represented that it has terminated the conduct that led to the Apparent Violations\\\\\\\\nand undertook the following measures intended to minimize the risk of recurrence of similar\\\\\\\\nconduct in the future:\\\\\\\\n1 Effective October 12, 2017, pursuant to Executive Order 13761 (as amended by Executive Order 13804), U.S. persons are no\\\\\\\\nlonger prohibited from engaging in transactions that were previously prohibited solely under the SSR.  Consistent with the\\\\\\\\nrevocation of these sanctions, OFAC removed the SSR from the Code of Federal Regulations on June 29, 2018.  However, the\\\\\\\\nrevocation of these sanctions does not affect past, present, or future OFAC enforcement investigations or actions related to any\\\\\\\\napparent violations of the SSR arising from activities that occurred prior to October 12, 2017.3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 Blocking IP addresses that appear to originate in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria from\\\\\\\\nconnecting to the BitPay website or from viewing any instructions on how to make\\\\\\\\npayment;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 Checking physical and email addresses of merchants\\\\\\\\u2019 buyers when provided by the\\\\\\\\nmerchants to prevent completion of an invoice from the merchant if BitPay identifies a\\\\\\\\nsanctioned jurisdiction address or email top-level domain; and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 Launching \\\\\\\\u201cBitPay ID,\\\\\\\\u201d a new customer identification tool that is mandatory for\\\\\\\\nmerchants\\\\\\\\u2019 buyers who wish to pay a BitPay invoice equal to or above $3,000.  As part of\\\\\\\\nBitPay ID, the merchant\\\\\\\\u2019s customer must provide an email address, proof of\\\\\\\\nidentification/photo ID, and a selfie photo.\\\\\\\\n(6) As part of its agreement with OFAC, BitPay has undertaken to continue its implementation of\\\\\\\\nthese and other compliance commitments.\\\\\\\\nCompliance Considerations\\\\\\\\nThis action highlights that companies involved in providing digital currency services\\\\\\\\u2014like all financial\\\\\\\\nservice providers\\\\\\\\u2014should understand the sanctions risks associated with providing digital currency\\\\\\\\nservices and should take steps necessary to mitigate those risks.  Companies that facilitate or engage in\\\\\\\\nonline commerce or process transactions using digital currency are responsible for ensuring that they do\\\\\\\\nnot engage in unauthorized transactions prohibited by OFAC sanctions, such as dealings with blocked\\\\\\\\npersons or property, or engaging in prohibited trade or investment-related transactions.\\\\\\\\nTo mitigate such risks, administrators, exchangers, and other companies involved in using digital\\\\\\\\ncurrencies should develop a tailored, risk-based sanctions compliance program.  OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s Framework for\\\\\\\\nOFAC Compliance Commitments notes that each risk-based sanctions compliance program will vary\\\\\\\\ndepending on a variety of factors, including the company\\\\\\\\u2019s size and sophistication, products and services,\\\\\\\\ncustomers and counterparties, and geographic locations, but should be predicated on and incorporate at\\\\\\\\nleast five essential components of compliance: (1) management commitment; (2) risk assessment;\\\\\\\\n(3) internal controls; (4) testing and auditing; and (5) training.  Within that framework, this enforcement\\\\\\\\naction emphasizes the importance of screening all available information, including IP addresses and other\\\\\\\\nlocation data of customers and counterparties, to mitigate sanctions risks in connection with digital\\\\\\\\ncurrency services.\\\\\\\\nAdditional guidance from OFAC related to the provision of digital currency services can be found here:\\\\\\\\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/topic/1626.\\\\\\\\nOFAC Enforcement and Compliance Resources\\\\\\\\nOn May 2, 2019, OFAC published A Framework for OFAC Compliance Commitments in order to\\\\\\\\nprovide organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction, as well as foreign entities that conduct business in or\\\\\\\\nwith the United States or U.S. persons, or that use U.S.-origin goods or services, with OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s\\\\\\\\nperspective on the essential components of a sanctions compliance program.  The Framework also\\\\\\\\noutlines how OFAC may incorporate these components into its evaluation of apparent violations and\\\\\\\\nresolution of investigations resulting in settlements.  The Framework includes an appendix that offers a\\\\\\\\nbrief analysis of some of the root causes of apparent violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions4\\\\\\\\nprograms OFAC has identified during its investigative process.\\\\\\\\nInformation concerning the civil penalties process is discussed in OFAC regulations governing the\\\\\\\\nvarious sanctions programs and in 31 C.F.R. Part 501.  On November 9, 2009, OFAC published\\\\\\\\nAppendix A to Part 501, the Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines.  See 74 Fed. Reg. 57,593\\\\\\\\n(Nov. 9, 2009).

But\\\\\\\\nthe stock value of shares in the account has been diminished due to abnormal fall of prices\\\\\\\\nof shares.

Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  16 February 2021   SEC CANCELS CHIYUTO\\\\\\\\u2019S OPC REGISTRATION OVER ILLEGAL INVESTMENT SCHEME  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revoked the certificate of incorporation of Chiyuto Creative Wealth Documentation Facilitation Services for operating an unauthorized investment program resembling a Ponzi scheme.   In its order of revocation issued on February 15, the SEC Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD) also imposed penalties totaling P9 million against Chiyuto and its single stockholder Patrocenio Calvez Chiyuto, Jr. for administrative violations of Republic Act No. 8799, or the Securities Regulation Code (SRC).   Moreover, Mr. Chiyuto was permanently disqualified from being a director of other corporations.  The EIPD issued the order after finding that Chiyuto has been offering and selling securities to the public through a double-your-money roulette game without the necessary license from the Commission. This is considered an ultra vires act, prohibited under Section 44 of Republic Act No. 11232, or the Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines (RCC).   Chiyuto\\\\\\\\u2019s activities further constitute serious misrepresentation as to what it can do to the great prejudice of or damage to the general public, which is a ground for the revocation of a corporation\\\\\\\\u2019s certificate of registration under Presidential Decree No. 902-A, according to the EIPD.   The SEC has warned the public against placing their money in Chiyuto, initially through an advisory on August 18, 2020 and an investor alert on its official Facebook page on October 23, 2020.   The Commission subsequently issued a cease and desist order against Chiyuto on February 1 and a show cause letter on February 2 for Chiyuto to explain why its registration as a one person corporation (OPC) should not be revoked.   Chiyuto, which initially registered as a sole proprietorship with the Department of Trade and Industry and later on as an OPC with the SEC, has offered investments to the public with promised returns of 100% in one day, 30 days or 45 days.   Under the scheme, an investor places as low as P1 to as much as P1 million, after which Chiyuto will spin the roulette to select the payout schedule. The investor is then Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary S-309, 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  issued a promissory note with the corresponding return and day when the guaranteed earnings could be claimed.   In addition, Chiyuto has offered a 5% referral commission and held raffles with brand new cars and motorcycles as prizes to attract more investors.  Chiyuto\\\\\\\\u2019s scheme involves securities, particularly an investment contract, whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits primarily from the efforts of others.  As a form of security, investment contracts must be registered with the SEC before they can be sold or offered within the Philippines, pursuant to Section 8 of SRC. Records of the Commission, however, showed that Chiyuto has neither registered any securities nor applied for the necessary license to offer such securities for sale.  \\\\\\\\u201cTo make matters worse, the scheme being offered by Chiyuto bears the tell-tale signs of a Ponzi scheme where the profits or pay-outs taken from the incoming investors or additional \\\\\\\\u2018pay-ins\\\\\\\\u2019 shall be paid to existing or earlier members-investors,\\\\\\\\u201d the EIPD noted in the revocation order.   Ponzi schemes rely on the contributions of more investors to pay off the returns of earlier-stage members, rather than from the actual sale of products or services from a legitimate business.   \\\\\\\\u201cThat Don Chiyuto could not present any specific business plan or cite a profitable enterprise to finance his money-making scheme clearly shows that the investment scheme which he and his companies foisted on the unsuspecting public was fraudulent,\\\\\\\\u201d the EIPD explained.  The EIPD further pointed out that Chiyuto\\\\\\\\u2019s paid-up capital amounted to \\\\\\\\u201conly a paltry P250,000\\\\\\\\u201d despite reports that its business transactions reached hundreds of millions of pesos.   \\\\\\\\u201cWherefore, for violation of Section 44 of the Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines (RCC or R.A. 11232) in relation to Sections 8.1, 28.1 and 26.1 of the Securities Regulation Code, P.D. 902-A and Section 179 (j) of the RCC, the Certificate of Incorporation and the registration of Chiyuto Creative Wealth Document Facilitation Services OPC as a one person corporation is hereby revoked,\\\\\\\\u201d the order read.

(currently known as Pazel International Ltd.) Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 2 of 52   Background 1. An investigation was conducted by Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) into the trading in the scrip of Rutron International Ltd. (currently known as Pazel International Ltd.) (\\\\\\\\u201cCompany / Rutron\\\\\\\\u201d for convenience), for the period of May 03, 2012 to November 28, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d) for possible violation, if any, of the provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) and SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \"PFUTP Regulations, 2003\"). 2. It was observed during the investigation that trading in the scrip of the Company was suspended with effect from November 15, 1999 on account of non-compliance of Listing Agreement and the same was revoked by the stock exchange with effect from July 01, 2011. During the course of investigation, the price volume data in the scrip of the Company was analyzed and it was noticed that the scrip opened at a price of \\\\\\\\u20b95.25 on May 03, 2012 and increased to a level of \\\\\\\\u20b9269.70 (closing price) on September 10, 2013. Subsequently, there was a stock split of existing equity shares of the Company in the ratio of 1:10 with effect from November 22, 2013. Investigation further noticed that subsequent to the stock split, the price of the scrip of Rutron opened at \\\\\\\\u20b924.45 and thereafter fell down and closed at \\\\\\\\u20b97.3 on November 28, 2014. 3. Based on price-volume movements noticed in the scrip of the Company, the Investigation Period has been divided into the following three patches for the purpose of better examination: Patch-1: Price Rise (\\\\\\\\u20b95.25 to \\\\\\\\u20b9214.45) May 03, 2012 to Feb 11, 2013.

On the basis of UCC details, financial transactions, MCA data, etc. examined during the course of investigation, certain group of connected entities including the Noticees (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cconnected group entities\\\\\\\\u201d) were identified and while analyzing the price and trade movement in the scrip of Rutron, the following facts, inter alia, came to light: Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 4 of 52   Patch-1 (May 03, 2012 to February 11, 2013) a) During Patch-1, the price of the scrip of Rutron opened at \\\\\\\\u20b95.25 and closed at \\\\\\\\u20b9214.45 and the scrip witnessed a sharp price rise of 3985%, with a net LTP contribution of \\\\\\\\u20b9209.20 to the scrip. b) Investigation revealed that, during Patch-1, 3 entities viz. Noticee no. 12, Noticee no. 13 and Noticee no. 14 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201d3 Noticees\\\\\\\\u201d) together have sold 866 shares of Rutron in 116 trades. Out of 115 such trades involving trading of only 861 shares, the 3 Noticees have contributed \\\\\\\\u20b9201.97 towards the market positive Last Traded Price (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201c(+) LTP / positive LTP\\\\\\\\u201d) which constituted 96.49% of contribution to the net positive LTP of the scrip observed during Patch-1 of the Investigation Period. c) Investigation also noticed that in spite of the fact that the trading system displayed buy orders for larger quantities of the scrip being available in the market, the 3 Noticees herein kept placing their sell orders for very small quantities i.e. 5-10 shares only on a repeated basis in each of their transactions always at prices higher than the LTP just to match the price of the pending buy orders, which contributed substantial rise in the price of the scrip of Rutron. It was also witnessed that the 3 Noticees were holding substantial quantities of shares of the Company before executing these 115 trades and despite holding abundant quantity of shares, they released very small number of shares in a controlled manner and matched their sell orders with the existing positive LTP contributing buy orders, mostly by offering shares in the range of 5 shares on a given trading day. d) Based on the aforesaid findings, investigation noted that the 3 Noticees were not acting as genuine sellers and rather by acting in a concerted manner, manipulated the price of the scrip of Rutron and created misleading appearance of trading in the scrip of the Company. Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 5 of 52   Patch-2 (February 12, 2013 to November 21, 2013) e) Upon examining the trades executed in the Patch-2 period, investigation noticed that the price of scrip opened at \\\\\\\\u20b9218.60 on February 12, 2013 and after reaching a high of \\\\\\\\u20b9270 during the Patch-2, the scrip closed at a price of \\\\\\\\u20b9243 on November 21, 2013 thereby experiencing a rise of 11.11%(\\\\\\\\u20b924.30) in its market price with a total market positive LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b9318.40 contributed by the traders to the scrip during this period.  f) The examination of trades executed in Patch-2, revealed that a group of 6 connected Noticees viz. Noticee nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 and 11 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201c6 Noticees\\\\\\\\u201d) through their 64 trades (15815 quantity of shares) executed inter se amongst each other, had contributed a market positive LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b916.85 (5.26% of total market positive LTP) in the scrip of Rutron. g) In the above 64 trades, Noticee nos. 1, 2, 3 and 9 were acting as buyers while Noticee nos. 4 and 11 were acting as counterparties / sellers. These 6 Noticees while acting in concert by executing intra group trades at prices higher than the LTP, contributed to the price rise in the scrip of Rutron and created a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip. Patch-3 (November 22, 2013 to November 28, 2014) h) With effect from November 22, 2013, there was a stock split of the existing equity shares in the ratio of 1:10 in the scrip of Rutron. During Patch-3 of the Investigation Period, the price of the scrip opened at \\\\\\\\u20b924.45 (unadjusted price of \\\\\\\\u20b9244.5), reached a low of \\\\\\\\u20b96.55 (unadjusted price of \\\\\\\\u20b965.5) and closed at \\\\\\\\u20b97.3 (unadjusted price of \\\\\\\\u20b973), thereby witnessing a fall of 70.14% with a contribution of net negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b917.15 (unadjusted price of 171.5) and total market negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b972.96 (unadjusted price of \\\\\\\\u20b9729.6). i) Investigation further discovered that by executing 201 trades inter se amongst themselves at prices lower than LTP, a group of six Noticees herein viz. Noticee nos. 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201csix Noticees\\\\\\\\u201d) have contributed Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 6 of 52   to a price fall of \\\\\\\\u20b912.74 i.e. 17.46% of the total market negative LTP during Patch-3 in the scrip of Rutron. It is again noticed that the six Noticees while executing 201 such intra-group trades, Noticee nos. 3, 5 and 8 were on the seller side and other 3 Noticees viz. Noticee nos. 6, 7, and 10 were playing the role of counter party buyers. j) Based on the aforesaid findings, investigation noted that the aforesaid six Noticees (Noticee nos. 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10) while acting in concert as a group during Patch-3 of the Investigation Period, have also created a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip.  6. Investigation noticed that the aforesaid trading pattern followed by the above noted 14 Noticees during various Patches of Investigation period, was prima facie aimed at creating an artificial and misleading appearance of trading in the scrip in the minds of the investors of Securities Market and other market participants. Keeping in view the afore said factual findings, it has been alleged that the aforesaid trades executed by the Noticee nos. 12, 13 and 14 during Patch-1, by the Noticee nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 and 11 during the Patch-2 and also the trades of Noticee nos. 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 during Patch-3 of the Investigation period were not genuine trades executed as normal prudent investors or traders and were alleged to have been executed with a view to manipulate the price of the scrip of the Company. Further, the unusual, abnormal and fraudulent way of trading in the scrip as displayed by these Noticees, have apparently created a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip to the market participants. Such acts of the Noticees have been alleged to be in breach of provisions of regulation 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and regulation 4(1), 4(2) (a), (e) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. Show Cause Notice and Reply 7. Pursuant to the aforesaid findings made during the investigation, a common Show Cause Notice dated January 18, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued to all the 14 Noticees, asking them to show cause as to why suitable direction(s) Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 7 of 52   under Section 11, 11(4) & 11 (B) SEBI Act, 1992 shall not be issued to them for their alleged acts of violations of provisions of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. 8. I note from the available records that the aforesaid SCN was served on Noticee nos. 4, 8, 9 and 11 to 14 by post. For Noticee nos. 1 and 3, the SCN was served through Affixtures / Hand Delivery. For the remaining Noticees viz. Noticee nos. 2, 5, 6, 7 and 10, the SCN was served through Newspaper Publication. In this regard, Public Notices were published on 12.11.2019 in the Ananda Bazar Patrika (Kolkata Edition), the Times of India (West Bengal and Jaipur Edition) and the Rajasthan Patrika to effect service on the aforesaid Noticees. I find that in response to the SCN, certain Noticees have submitted their written replies. Further, Noticee nos. 4 and 8 vide separate letters dated 03.04.2018 have sought inspection of certain documents which was provided to them on 24.08.2018 and 23.08.2018 respectively. Additionally, vide letter(s) dated 23.12.2019, copies of documents which have been relied upon in the SCN were also sent by post to Noticee nos. 4 and 8. I also note that the demand for certain documents including a copy of the entire Investigation Report (for convenience \\\\\\\\u201cIR\\\\\\\\u201d) as sought by the Noticee no. 8 were duly responded to him by stating that all the documents that have been relied upon in the SCN have already been provided to him hence, a further requisition of a copy of entire Investigation Report by him is unwarranted and not relevant to his case . Subsequently, in compliance with the principle of natural justice, an opportunity of personal hearing was accorded to all the Noticees and a date of hearing was fixed on 26.08.2020. I note from the records that the hearing notices were served on all the Noticees through post / email / newspaper publication. However, on the said date of hearing, Authorized Representatives (AR) appeared on behalf of Noticee nos. 4 and 8 and represented their case. Further, karta of Noticee no. 11 appeared on behalf of its HUF and made submissions. However, no one appeared on behalf of the other Noticees. In this regard, I note that the letter intimating the hearing notice as well as the newspaper publication contained an email address at which, Noticees could have contacted SEBI for communicating anything with respect to their attendance or inability to attend the personal hearing, however, from the materials Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 8 of 52   available before me, I don\\\\\\\\u2019t see any request from any of the remaining Noticees requesting for more time or adjournment of personal hearing having been received by SEBI so far. Under the circumstances, in my opinion the matter is ripe enough to be proceeded with based on the materials available on record, including the written replies to the SCN as well as the post hearing submissions filed by some of the Noticees, details of which are tabulated below: Table 2: Details of reply filed by the Noticees Noticee No.  Date of Reply Noticee no. 3 Letter dated January 15, 2020, October 08, 2020 Noticee no. 4 Letters dated April 03, 2018, November 01, 2019, September 16, 2020 Noticee no. 8 Letters dated April 03, 2018, November 01, 2019, January 06, 2020, August 25, 2020, September 18, 2020 Noticee no. 11 Letter dated September 25, 2020 Noticee no. 12 Undated letter received by SEBI on January 20, 2020 Noticee no. 13 Undated letter received by SEBI on January 25, 2020 Noticee no. 14 Undated letter received by SEBI on January 15, 2020  Submissions of the Noticees 9. After perusing the written replies filed by the Noticees in response to the allegations made in the SCN and by way of their post hearing submissions (as indicated in the preceding table), I summarize their replies hereunder: Noticee no. 3 (Padma Impex Private Limited) a) The Noticee has denied its connection with the other group connected entities. b) With regard to funds transfer by one of the connected group entities, Mr. Anil Agarwal (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cAnil\\\\\\\\u201d), Noticee has submitted that the said Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 9 of 52   money was received by it against repayment of advance taken by Mr. Anil from the Noticee. c) With regard to its financial transaction with Rutron, Noticee has submitted that the said transaction was repayment of loan received from Rutron by the Noticee.  d) The alleged trades were carried out in the normal course of business and on the stock exchange platform, wherein the counterparty is unknown. Noticee no. 4 (Ms. Manju Khandelia) e) The Noticee had not received any hearing notice and came to know about the hearing scheduled in the matter only upon publication in the newspaper, which could have been avoided.  f) Inspection of only certain documents was provided and documents requested for in the course of inspection are yet to be received. In the absence of receipt of such documents, Noticee has not been able to prepare a comprehensive reply. g) With regard to her connection alleged in the SCN, the Noticee has admitted that Mr. Anil is her brother and by virtue of that relationship, she was included in the category of promoter and promoter group in Comfort Fincap Limited (CFL). However, she held very miniscule i.e. 0.92% of the shares of CFL. Further, such shares of CFL were sold long back in the open market between October, 2013 to December, 2013. Moreover, no action has been initiated against Mr. Anil in this matter, and the SCN fails the test the principles of equity and is also against the Article 14 of Constitution of India.  h) Noticee has advanced the argument that the allegation of her connection with the other allegedly connected group entities is misconceived and without any basis. In this regard, Noticee has relied upon the observations of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the case of Canara Bank vs. Debasis Das (200) 4 CC 557. i)  Based on evidence, no connection of Noticee with counterparties / buyers of her trades during Patch-2 of the Investigation Period is established. Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 10 of 52   j) Noticee has sold around 5 lakhs shares in the scrip of Rutron and out of those total number of 5 lakh shares, 2,66,908 shares were alleged to be bought by other Noticees and only 15,615 shares have been alleged as manipulative. Therefore, 96.88% of trading of Noticee is not considered as manipulative. Hence, the allegation on the remaining 3.12% of total trades in shares of the Company is based on surmises and conjectures.  k) The total volume in the scrip of Rutron during the Investigation period was 10,23,62,427 shares. Therefore, Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s trading volume of those alleged trades in 15,615 shares i.e. only 0.02% of the total market volume is exceedingly miniscule to attract any serious charge of fraudulent and unfair trade practice and price manipulation.  Noticee no. 8 (Comfort Intech Limited) a) Inspection of only certain documents were provided and the documents requested for in the course of inspection are yet to be provided. In the absence of such documents, the Noticee has not been able to prepare a comprehensive reply. Noticee has referred to the following judgments with regard to non-supply of copy of certain documents sought during inspection: \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in matter of Price Waterhouse & Co. vs. SEBI (Civil Appeal Nos. 6003-6004 OF 2012) (DoD: 10.01.2017) \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in matter of State of UP vs. Shatrunghan Lal (DoD: 30.07.1998) \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in matter of Kashinath Dikshita vs. Union of India (1986 3 SCC 229) (DoD: 15.05.1986) \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Smitaben N Shah vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 37 of 2010) (DoD: 30.07.2010) \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Nitin Kumar Didwania vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 41 of 2016) (DoD: 02.05.2016) b) With reference to the funds transaction made by one of its Directors (Mr. Anil) of Noticee no. 8 with Noticee no. 3, the Noticee has informed that it was repayment Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 11 of 52   of a loan availed by Mr. Anil in his personal capacity and not in the capacity of Director / Promoter of the Noticee. Further, no action has been initiated against Mr. Anil by SEBI in this matter. c) With regard to the alleged connection with the Karta of Noticee no. 11, i.e. Mr. Jugal Chandrakant Thacker (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cJugal\\\\\\\\u201d), the Noticee has submitted that Mr. Jugal was only an Independent Director in the Noticee company and had never been involved in the business decisions. His role as an Independent Director was limited and restricted to the extent of attending board meetings and he was never involved in day to day management of the Noticee. d) Noticee had purchased 24,500 shares of Rutron at a price of \\\\\\\\u20b9267 per share in April 2013. After waiting for more than one year, since the price of the scrip did not rise as per the expectation, those shares were sold in and around July 2014 and the Noticee has incurred loss of \\\\\\\\u20b964.27 lakhs by selling those shares. e) The total trading volume in the scrip of Rutron during the Investigation period was 10,23,62,427 shares. Therefore, Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s trading volume involving the alleged 3000 shares i.e. only 0.0029% of the total market volume is exceedingly miniscule which tantamount to NIL percentage, hence too small to warrant any serious charge of fraudulent and unfair trade practice.  f) Further, the contribution of negative LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b90.08 through the alleged 3 sell trades involving 3000 shares by the Noticee, is very miniscule and does not warrant serious allegation of fraudulent and unfair trade practice. g) The alleged sell orders were placed around 3 pm, however, the buy orders were already available in the stock exchange\\\\\\\\u2019s system from around 09:18 am. As the Noticee has matched its sell orders with the available buy orders in the system, no adverse inference should be drawn against the Noticee for the same. h) The SCN has not been able to adduce any evidence for the loss incurred by investors or unfair gains made by any person including the Noticee in case of Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 12 of 52   the allegation that the Noticee has allegedly contributed to the fall in price of scrip of Rutron. Noticee no. 11 (Jugal Chandrakant Thacker HUF) i) With regard to the alleged connection that the Karta of Noticee no. 11 (Mr. Jugal) was holding by being one of the Directors in a connected group entity viz: CFL, the Noticee has submitted that Mr. Jugal was not a Director in CFL during the relevant time when the alleged transactions were carried out and was appointed as Director of the CFL only on August 02, 2014, i.e. nearly one and half years after the alleged trades in scrip of Rutron. j) As regard the allegation of connection with Noticee no. 5 (Ranisati Dealer Private Limited), it has been denied by stating that no such fund was received by it from Noticee no. 5. In this regard, Noticee has submitted that it has opened and operated only one bank account with HDFC Bank bearing no. \\\\\\\\u201d10531930003644\\\\\\\\u201d and has submitted the bank account statement of the aforementioned HDFC Bank account to support his contention of having not received any fund from Noticee no. 5. k) With regard to the manipulative trades alleged in the SCN, the Noticee has submitted that a sell trade of 200 shares, wherein a contribution of \\\\\\\\u20b90.10 to LTP has been made is very miniscule and is only 0.08% of the total positive LTP contributed in the scrip of Rutron during the relevant period. The Noticee has further argued that no allegation of any manipulation has been levelled on sale of 39,800 shares of Rutron. Noticee no. 12, 13 and 14 l) While denying the allegations made in the SCN, these Noticees have submitted that they do not share common address, as alleged in the SCN. 10. In addition to the above, Noticee no. 4 and Noticee no. 8 have relied on the observations made in the following orders to argue that no action should be initiated against them in absence of any action against the counter party: Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 13 of 52   \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of HB Stockholdings vs. SEBI (Date of Decision: 27.08.2013, Appeal 114 of 2012) \\\\\\\\uf0d8  Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of M/s Nishith Shah (HUF) vs. SEBI (Date of Decision: 16.01.2020, Appeal 97 of 2019) \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Narrotam Gandhi vs. SEBI (Date of Decision: 21.01.2020, Appeal 225 of 2019) \\\\\\\\uf0d8 SEBI WTM order in the matter of First Financial Services dated 02.04.2018. \\\\\\\\uf0d8 SEBI WTM order in the matter of Confidence Finance and Trading Limited dated 31.12.2018. Consideration of Issues and Findings 11. Considering the allegations leveled against the Noticees in the SCN based on the findings of investigation, the explanations offered by the Noticees to the allegations made in the SCN through their written replies and after hearing some of them personally, I find that in this case, the following issues require consideration: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Issue 1: Whether the Noticees are connected entities. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Issue 2: Whether the acts of the Noticee nos. 12, 13 and 14 during Patch-1 of the Investigation period have resulted in violations of the provisions of regulation 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and regulation 4 (1) and 4 (2) (a) and (e) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Issue 3: Whether the acts of the Noticee nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, and 11 during Patch-2 of Investigation Period have resulted in violations of the provisions of regulation 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and regulation 4 (1) and 4 (2) (a) and (e) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Issue 4: Whether the acts of the Noticee nos. 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 during Patch-3 of Investigation Period have resulted in violations of the provisions of regulation 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and regulation 4 (1) and 4 (2) (a) and (e) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003. 12. Before dealing with the aforementioned issues and the replies/arguments of the Noticees on charges on merit, I deem it necessary to deal with the preliminary objections raised by some of the Noticees. I note that Noticee nos. 4 and 8 have objected Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 14 of 52   to non-furnishing of certain documents including IR, its annexures and complete trade and order log etc. to them. In this regard, I note from the records available before me that the Noticee nos. 4 and 8 vide their letters dated November 01, 2019 and January 06, 2020 respectively had already raised similar issues before SEBI, to which a detailed reply stating therein the reasons for non-supply of certain documents have already been communicated vide letter dated December 23, 2019 and February 12, 2020 to them. It is noted that these Noticees have been provided with all the relevant extracts of the IR in the form of SCN & its annexures and also other documents relied upon in the SCN qua them. Further, Noticee no. 8 has also relied upon observations of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court and Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT to support its arguments. Having gone through the judicial decisions referred to by the Noticee, I am of the view that the observations made in those decisions referred to by the Noticee no. 8, are factually distinguishable from the present proceedings, hence, the propositions of law made therein are not applicable in the instant case. For instance, Noticee no. 8 has referred to the following observations of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in matter of Price Waterhouse (supra): \\\\\\\\u201cWe direct, that all statements recorded during the course of investigation shall be provided to the respondents. We further direct, that all documents collected during investigation shall be permitted to be inspected by the respondents. The authors of such statements (recorded during investigation), which are to be relied upon (against the respondents), shall be offered for cross-examination to the respondents. Only thereupon, it will be permissible to rely upon the same.\\\\\\\\u201d 13.  I note that while referring to the aforesaid observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in matter of Price Waterhouse (supra), the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of B. Ramalinga Raju vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 286 of 2014) (DoD: 12.05.2017), inter alia, has clarified that \\\\\\\\u201cApex Court in case of Price Waterhouse has specifically recorded that the directions given in that case are general directions given as and by way of clarifications without going into the merits of the case. Therefore, directions given in the facts of Price Waterhouse cannot be said to be the ratio laid down by the Apex Court applicable to all other Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 15 of 52   case\\\\\\\\u201d. Similarly, in the case of UP vs. Shatrunghan Lal (supra) referred to by the Noticee no. 8, I note that the documents which were referred to in the charge- sheet to draw strength relying thereon, were as evidence in support of articles of charges, were essential to be furnished to the accused and non-furnishing of those documents to the accused would have resulted in causing a grave prejudice thereby vitiating the proceedings. However, in the instant matter, it is noted that the documents which have been relied upon while making allegations in the SCN have already been furnished to the Noticees as annexures to the SCN and inspection of such documents have also been provided to Noticee nos. 4 and 8, in order to ensure fair opportunity to them and to avoid any prejudice Therefore, the contentions of non-furnishing of the copy of the IR by SEBI does not need to be seen with impunity as no prejudice has been shown to have caused to the Noticees by not furnishing the IR . Further, in the matter of Nitin Kumar Didwania (supra), the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT has inter alia directed SEBI to either provide the inspection of documents or give reasons for non-providing of inspection of documents. I feel the contention put forth by the Noticee is not applicable in the instant case because in the above referred case, request of the appellant for inspection of documents was rejected by recording that all the documents relied upon by SEBI while passing the interim order have already been provided to the appellant, however, in the instant matter, as already mentioned above, the Noticee has been provided with opportunity of inspecting the relevant documents and also vide its letter date February 12, 2020 has already provided detailed reasons for not providing certain other documents including the entire IR as requested for, to the Noticee no. 8. Apparently the other documents and IR as demanded by the Noticee did not have any relevance for the Noticee since all the relevant portions of the IR and other documents that have been relied upon in the SCN against the Noticees have already been made available to them. Regarding the contention of non-supply of complete trade and order logs, it would be apt to refer here to the observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Mayrose Capfin Pvt. Ltd. Vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 20 of 2012 decided on March 30, 2012) wherein the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Tribunal has, inter alia, stated that: \\\\\\\\u201c...no prejudice has been caused to the appellant on this count as the extract of the relevant trade logs and order Order in the matter of Rutron International Ltd.     Page 16 of 52   logs pertaining to the appellant was made available which was enough for him to defend himself or to make proper representation against the proposed action.\\\\\\\\u201d  14. Thus, from the material available on record, I note that relevant information which have been relied upon from the Investigation Report, had already been provided either in the SCN or as annexures to the SCN. Further, as highlighted above inspection of such documents have already been granted on August 23, 2018. Noticees have not explained as to how non-furnishing of those documents or portions of IR which have not been relied upon in the SCN, have caused prejudice to their interest in the present proceedings. Considering the foregoing, I find the contentions of the Noticees to be unfounded and unjustified and hence, do not require any further consideration.  15. I note that Noticee no. 4 has advanced an argument stating that the hearing notice in the captioned matter was served upon her through newspaper publication, which cannot be treated as a substitute to a notice personally served upon a party. In this regard, I note from the records available before me that the SCN was served upon the Noticee no. 4 on the last address available in the records i.e. \\\\\\\\u201cChenab Textile Mills, P.O. Kathua, Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, 184102\\\\\\\\u201dand Noticee no. 4 while replying to the SCN vide her letter dated April 03, 2018 had informed SEBI regarding her new correspondence address viz: \\\\\\\\u201cC/2801, Oberoi Woods, Mohan Gokhale Road, Goregaon (East), Mumbai-400063\\\\\\\\u201d.

In re: Violation of provisions of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003  In respect of:  Name of the Entity  PAN DIN Mr. Harivallabh Mundra AAAPM8378D 00434785  1. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had conducted an investigation into the trading and dealings in the scrip of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cVLFL\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cthe Company\\\\\\\\u201d) pursuant to receipt of a reference from Department of Income Tax, Chandigarh, for possible violation, if any, of the provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and rules and regulations made thereunder. Investigation was conducted in the scrip of VLFL for the period August 12, 2014, to July 31, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period/ IP\\\\\\\\u201d). During the IP the price of the scrip opened at Rs. 2.42 and reached a high price of Rs. 32.10 and closed at Rs.32.10. Pursuant to the investigation, a common Show Cause Notice (SCN) dated October 13, 2017, was issued to the concerned entities, including Mr. Harivallabh Mundra (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d).  2. It was alleged in the SCN that the off-market transferors, group of connected sellers and VLFL, as well as its directors, including the Noticee, have violated Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and Regulations 4(1) and 4(2) (a) and (e) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d).  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 2 of 20  3. The Noticee was called to show cause as to why suitable directions under Sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act should not be issued against him for the violations alleged in the SCN. The documents enclosed as annexure to the SCN were (a) relevant extract of the reference received from the IT Department, Chandigarh, (b) corporate announcements of the Company during the investigation period, (c) the documents on the basis of which connection was established between entities, (d) reply received from BSE, (e) complete trade log and (f) order log for VLFL scrip for the period and sell order log analysis.  4. The SCN was served on the Noticee and an opportunity of personal hearing was also granted on August 22, 2019. The Noticee sought an adjournment and a new date of October 16, 2019, was granted. The Authorized Representative of the Noticee, vide an email sent on the day of the hearing again requested for an adjournment, which was rejected since one request for adjournment had already been granted. The Noticee was granted 10 days\\\\\\\\u2019 time to submit his reply.   5. Subsequently, vide order dated April 13, 2020, the Noticee was restrained from accessing the securities market for a period of two (02) years from the date of the order. It was recorded in the order that despite two opportunities for hearing being granted to the Noticee, neither had he appeared before SEBI, nor had he submitted any reply to the SCN.  6. The Noticee appealed against the above mentioned order in the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). It was mentioned in the appeal that the Noticee had filed a reply on October 15, 2019, which was not considered by SEBI. The appeal was allowed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT vide order dated August 10, 2020, and the impugned order of SEBI was quashed in so far as the Noticee is concerned. The matter was remitted to SEBI to reconsider the matter afresh after considering the reply of the Noticee and after taking into consideration all other factors and after giving an opportunity of hearing to the Noticee.  7. Subsequently, the Noticee was granted an opportunity of hearing on August 27, 2020, and the same was attended by the authorized representative of the Noticee. During the hearing, the Noticee reiterated its submissions made vide letter dated October 15, 2019, which are as below:  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 3 of 20  7.1. SEBI granted inspection of certain documents and records on November 12, 2018; however, inspection of investigation report and other relevant documents was refused. The same amounts to violation of Principles of Natural Justice.   7.2. Noticee denies that he was an Executive Director of the Company during the investigation period or that he was aware of any transactions between the Company and Looklike or that he was involved in the said alleged manipulation of the scrip price. Nothing contained in the SCN may be considered as having been accepted or admitted by the Noticee merely on account of non-traverse.  7.3. Noticee submits that he had ceased to be involved in the affairs of the Company since 2011 after the Company was taken over by Mrs. Madhuri Damani. He formally submitted his resignation as a Director to the Company vide letter dated March 31, 2014, a copy of which is annexed to the SCN. However, from the records provided by SEBI showed that the Company filed Form DIR 12 with the ROC/MCA only on October 10, 2014, and in said form, wrongly stated that the Noticee ceased to be a Director w.e.f. September 29, 2014. It is a trite law that resignation of a Director takes effect on the date of submission of his resignation to the Company. Therefore, the observation in the SCN that the Noticee was an Executive Director in the Company till September 29, 2014, is erroneous and false. Moreover, in its Annual Report for FY 2014-15, the Company falsely declared that the Noticee had attended Board Meetings and AGMs.  7.4. Since SEBI was refusing to provide any document other than those annexed to the said SCN and since Noticee was no longer associated with the Company and had no access to its records, vide letter dated July 2, 2018, Noticee sought clarification regarding the statement of the Company in its annual report for FY 2014-15 that he had attended Board Meetings and AGMs and regarding Form DIR 12. Till date no, despite reminders, Noticee is yet to hear from the Company. Copy of letter sent to Company was attached. Noticee submits that without these records, he is unable to effectively reply to the charges against him.  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 4 of 20  7.5. Noticee submits that SEBI has relied upon the bank statement of the Company to show connection between it and Looklike through fund transaction, which took place on January 09, 2015, and another transaction which took place on March 27, 2015. Noticee submits that both these transactions occurred much after he ceased to be a director in the Company, whether on March 31, 2014, or September 29, 2014. Neither the Company nor Noticee is not otherwise shown to be associated or connected with Looklike. Therefore, the said bank statement cannot be basis to allege that Noticee was aware of the connection between the Company and Looklike and/ or that he was involved in a scheme to manipulate the scrip price.  7.6. The SCN does not set out the directions proposed to be issued by SEBI. As per the conditions set out by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in Gorkha Security Services vs. Government (NCT of Delhi) and others, the SCN should fulfil the requirements of principles of natural justice viz., (i) material/ ground to be stated which according to the department necessitates an action and (ii) particular penalty/ action which is proposed to be taken. Hence, SCN is not compliant with principles of natural justice.  7.7. Noticee requests that the Company may be directed to provide him with all relevant documents and records pertaining to Board Meetings and Shareholder Meetings for FY 2014-15 and relating to acceptance of his resignation as a Director and that he may be given 4 weeks\\\\\\\\u2019 time from fate of receipt of such documents to make further submissions.  8. During the personal hearing on August 27, 2020, the Noticee was advised to submit the following information:   8.1. Copy of the resignation letter sent to the Company along with the acknowledgment of its receipt by the Company.  8.2. Whether the Noticee filed Form DIR-11 (Notice of resignation of a director to the Registrar) with ROC/ MCA? If not filed, then the reason for the same.  8.3. Whether Noticee has any evidence to show that he did not attend the Board Meetings of the Company in FY 2013-14 and FY 2014-15?  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 5 of 20  9. The submissions of the Noticee vide letter dated September 04, 2020, are as below:  9.1. Noticee was a Director in the Company from June 21, 1990, to March 31, 2014. However, post-2011, the Noticee ceased to be involved in the management and decision making activities after the Company was taken over by Mrs. Madhuri Damani.  9.2. Noticee sent his resignation to the Company vide letter dated March 31, 2014, which was received by them on June 17, 2014. Copy of letter and postal acknowledgement thereof is annexed.  9.3. Noticee, in his earlier reply dated October 15, 2019, has wrongly mentioned that the resignation letter was part of the annexures to the SCN and regrets the error.  9.4. Noticee submits that Section 168 of the Companies Act, 2013, requiring the Director to submit Form DIR 11 with the ROC became effective only from April 01, 2014, and hence, as on date of sending the resignation letter, Noticee understood that he was not required to file Form DIR 11 with the ROC. This is further substantiated by the resignation letter which categorically mentioned that the Noticee under advice requests that the Company may file the requisite Form 32 with the ROC which is as per the erstwhile Companies Act, 1956.  9.5. As can be seen from the annual report for FY 2013-14 (pg. 26), the Company had removed the Noticee from decision making positions; he was replaced from the Investor Grievance Committee by one Mr. Amlesh Sadhu.  9.6. Noticee submits that to the best of his recollection, during FY 2014-15, he did not attend a single Board Meeting or AGM of the Company. A director attending any Board Meeting is entitled to sitting fees which is stated in their annual reports. No such fee or remuneration was received by the Noticee during FY 2014-15; this substantiates his recollection that he did not attend any board meetings during the relevant time. The Noticee repeats, reiterates and submits that despite his requests, the Company has not made available  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 6 of 20  to him copies of the minutes of the Board Meetings and AGM/EGM for FYs 2013-14 and 2014-15. The Noticee repeats and reiterates that he has not attended any meeting with regard to nor is aware of the purported transactions which are subject matter of the current proceedings.  9.7. The annual report of the company for FY 2014-15 wrongly mentions that the Noticee was present during 7 of the 13 Board Meetings in the said year. Further the report mentions that the Noticee is a Non-Executive director; this is contrary to their own record and resignation letter. The Noticee submits that it is only after receipt of the SCN dated October 13, 2017, that the Noticee became aware that he was shown as an attendee during such meetings and as a non-executive director. In order to clarify the situation, the Noticee has sought information from the company vide letter dated July 03, 2018, and has not received any reply as yet.  9.8. The Noticee humbly submits that the share transfers took place in August 2014 onwards, which is much after the resignation letter was received by the Company. The Noticee was admittedly not involved nor in charge or a director during the relevant time of fund transfers to Looklike or transfer of equity shares by them in off-market transfers.  10. In view of the above submissions, the Noticee has prayed that he may be given the benefit of doubt and discharged from the present proceedings by passing of an appropriate order.  Issues for Consideration and Findings:  11. Before determining the issues that arise for consideration, I note here that as already established in the order dated April 13, 2020, the pre-meditated scheme for manipulating the price of the scrip of VLFL involved, inter alia, the following:  11.1. Preferential allotment of shares of VLFL to one of the off-market transferors viz., Looklike Trade Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cLooklike\\\\\\\\u201d) in FY 2013-14. 11.2. Transfer of shares of VLFL by the off-market transferors through off-market transfers to the connected sellers during the investigation period i.e., in  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 7 of 20  August 2014. 11.3. The subsequent trading pattern of these sellers whereby they have contributed to an increase in the net and positive LTP of the share price of the Company. 11.4. Fund transfer from VLFL to Looklike in January 2015.  12. A clear connection was established between VLFL and Looklike in view of the preferential allotment of shares made to Looklike and the subsequent fund transfer made by VLFL to Looklike during the investigation period. It was also held in the order that this pre-meditated scheme to manipulate the share price of VLFL is a fraudulent activity, which is covered under the definition of fraud, as per Regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations. I note here that this pre-meditated scheme was set in motion in FY 2013-14, when the preferential allotment of shares of VLFL was made to Looklike.  13. I have considered the allegations of the SCN, submissions made by the Noticee and the material available on record. The following issues arise for consideration:  13.1. Issue No. 1: In view of the submissions of the Noticee, whether he is part of the scheme for manipulating price of the scrip of VLFL during the period August 12, 2014, to July 31, 2015?  13.2. Issue No. 2: If answer to Issue No. 1 is in affirmative, whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of PFUTP Regulations?  13.3. Issue No. 3: If answer to Issue No. 2 is in affirmative, what directions, if any, should be issued against the Noticee?  Issue No. 1: In view of the submissions of the Noticee, whether he is part of the scheme for manipulating price of the scrip of VLFL during the period August 12, 2014, to July 31, 2015?  14. I note here that VLFL, though a legal entity, cannot act by itself and can act only through its Directors. They are expected to exercise their power on behalf of the company with utmost care, skill and diligence. In terms of Section 179 of the Companies Act, 2013, the Board of Directors of a company shall be entitled to  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 8 of 20  exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as the company is authorized to exercise and do. Therefore, the Board of Directors being responsible for the conduct of the business of a company are liable for acts of commission and omission and such liability shall be upon the individual directors also. Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme court while describing what is the duty of a Director of a company held in Official Liquidator vs. P.A. Tendolkar (1973) 1 SCC 602 that  \\\\\\\\u201cA Director may be shown to be so placed and to have been so closely and so long associated personally with the management of the Company that he will be deemed to be not merely cognizant of but liable for fraud in the conduct of the business of a Company even though no specific act of dishonesty is proved against him personally. He cannot shut his eyes to what must be obvious to everyone who examines the affairs of the Company even superficially\\\\\\\\u201d.   15. Further, in cases of fraud, it is a settled position of law that the corporate veil can be lifted and the directors can be held liable for the fraud of the Company. In this regard, I place reliance on the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court (Larger Bench) in the matter of LIC vs. Escorts Limited (1986 AIR 1370), wherein while discussing the doctrine of corporate veil, the Court had observed:   \\\\\\\\u201c90. \\\\\\\\u2026 the corporate veil may be lifted where a statute itself contemplates lifting the veil, or fraud or improper conduct is intended to be prevented, or a taxing statute or a beneficent statute is sought to be evaded or where associated companies are inextricably connected as to be, in reality, part of one concern. It is neither necessary nor desirable to enumerate the classes of cases where lifting the veil is permissible, since that must necessarily depend on the relevant statutory or other provisions, the object sought to be achieved, the impugned conduct, the involvement of the element of the public interest, the effect on parties who may be affected, etc.\\\\\\\\u201d   16. In view of the above, I now consider the submissions of the Noticee vis-\\\\\\\\xe0-vis the material available on record to determine his role, if any, in the pre-mediated scheme for manipulating the price of VLFL.   17. As regards the designation of the Noticee, I note that the following was mentioned in the SCN:  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 9 of 20  DIN/PAN Name Designation Appointment Date Cessation Date 00434785/ AAAPM8378D Harivallabh Mundra Executive Director 21-Jun-1990 26-Sept- 2014  18. The Noticee has denied that he was an Executive Director in VLFL during the investigation period or that he was aware of any transactions between the Company and Looklike or that he was involved in the said alleged manipulation of the scrip price. He has claimed that he formally submitted his resignation as a Director to the Company vide letter dated March 31, 2014, which was received by them on June 17, 2014. He submitted that resignation of a Director takes effect on the date of submission of his resignation to the Company. Therefore, he submitted that the observation in the SCN that the Noticee was an Executive Director in the Company till September 29, 2014, is erroneous and false.  19. I have examined the copy of the resignation letter submitted by the Noticee along with the acknowledgement card of its receipt. The letter is dated March 31, 2014, and is addressed to the Board of Directors of VLFL. The Noticee has mentioned that he is resigning as a Director due to personal reasons with immediate effect. While the acknowledgement card mentions the receipt date as June 17, 2014, and is addressed to the Board of Directors of VLFL, I note the following points:  19.1. The date on the letter is written by hand, while the rest of the letter is typed.  19.2. There is no stamp of the post office that is delivering the letter to the addressee. 19.3. There is no signature of the person who may have accepted the letter on behalf of the addressee. 19.4. The resignation letter and the print out of the acknowledgement card has an initial on it but it is not clear who the initials belong to. The Noticee has also not elaborated on the same. 19.5. The resignation letter is dated March 31, 2014, and addressed to the Board of VLFL at their Fort, Mumbai, address, while the address on the acknowledgement card is of Malad.  19.6. The letter is an intra-city letter; however, as per submissions of Noticee, it has been received by VLFL on June 17, 2014, i.e., after two and a half months of being posted.  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 10 of 20  20. In view of the above observations, I am of the view that the evidence provided by the Noticee is not sufficient to show that his resignation letter was received by VLFL on June 17, 2014. Hence, I am inclined to hold that the Noticee ceased to be a Director of the Company on September 26, 2014, as recorded in MCA records. It is important to note that the Noticee did not provide any explanations for the evident discrepancies observable in the copy of the resignation letter and acknowledgement card while he submitted those documents to SEBI. I further note that even if I were to accept that the Noticee has resigned on March 31, 2014, or that the resignation letter was indeed received by VLFL on June 17, 2014, as already mentioned above, the pre-meditated scheme of price manipulation was set in motion in FY 2013-14 i.e., when admittedly, the Noticee was a Director in VLFL.   21. In view of his claim that his resignation was accepted on June 17, 2014, I note that the Noticee has denied that he was an Executive Director in VLFL during the investigation period, which starts from August 12, 2014, and extends till July 31, 2015. In view of the finding at Paragraph 20, the resignation of the Noticee has taken effect from September 26, 2014, i.e., after the start of the investigation period. While the investigation period covers the period starting from the first off-market transfer of shares from Looklike and the manipulation in the price of the scrip, I note that the pre-meditated scheme also includes the preferential allotment of shares made to Looklike in August 2013. Here, I would like to refer the following material which is available from the Annual Reports of VLFL:  21.1. As per the Annual Reports of the Company, the Noticee has been a Director in the Company since June 21, 1990. 21.2. As per the Annual Report for FY 2012-13, the Noticee has been designated as \\\\\\\\u2018Executive Director\\\\\\\\u2019 and has also been referred to as the Whole-Time Director and a Key Management Personnel as part of Related Party Disclosures. 21.3. The Board of Directors of the Company in its meeting dated July 02, 2013, approved the allotment of shares through preferential allotment and the resolution to allot the shares to Looklike Trade Pvt. Ltd. was approved by the Board in its meeting held on August 03, 2013. 21.4. As per the Annual Report for FY 2013-14, i.e., for the period when the preferential allotment was made to Looklike Trade Pvt. Ltd., the Noticee is  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 11 of 20  designated as \\\\\\\\u2018Executive Director\\\\\\\\u2019 as on March 31, 2014, though the same annual report also mentions his designation as \\\\\\\\u2018Non-Executive Director\\\\\\\\u2019. 21.5. As per the Annual Report for FY 2014-15, the Noticee has been designated as an \\\\\\\\u2018Independent Director\\\\\\\\u2019 as well as an \\\\\\\\u2018Non-Executive Director\\\\\\\\u2019.  22. I note here that the Noticee has NOT denied that he was an Executive Director in VLFL during FY 2013-14 i.e., during the period when the preferential allotment of shares was made to Looklike and when the pre-meditated scheme to manipulate the price of the scrip of VLFL was put into place. The Noticee has also not denied that he was a Director in VLFL since 1990 and hence, I note that he has been closely and for a long period associated personally with the management of the Company. Here, I once again refer to the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of Official Liquidator vs. P.A. Tendolkar (1973) 1 SCC 602, wherein it has described the duty of a Director of a company (relevant extract of the judgment is referred to in Paragraph 14 above). However, the Noticee has submitted that he had ceased to be involved in the affairs of the Company since 2011 after the Company was taken over by Mrs. Madhuri Damani. He has also submitted that in FY 2013-14, he was removed from decision making positions viz., he was replaced from the Investor Grievance Committee by one Mr. Amlesh Sadhu. Hence, I proceed to determine the role of the Noticee in FY 2013-14 and FY 2014-15 (till his resignation) in VLFL on the basis of the material available in the annual reports.  23. As per Item I, Para A, Sub-clause (iii) of Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement specified by SEBI vide its circular dated SEBI/CFD/DIL/CG/1/2004/12/10 dated October 29, 2004, as amended from time to time, I note the following conditions are to be satisfied for an Independent Director:  \\\\\\\\u201cI. Board of Directors  (A) Composition of Board (i) The Board of directors of the company shall have an optimum combination of executive and non-executive directors with not less than fifty percent of the board of directors comprising of non-executive directors. (ii) Where the Chairman of the Board is a non-executive director, at least one-third of the Board should comprise of independent directors and in case he  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 12 of 20  is an executive director, atleast half of the Board should comprise of independent directors.  Provided that where the non-executive Chairman is a promoter of the company or is related to any promoter or person occupying management positions at the Board level or at one level below the Board, at least one-half of the Board of the company shall consist of independent directors.  Explanation-For the purpose of the expression \\\\\\\\u201crelated to any promoter\\\\\\\\u201d referred to in sub-clause (ii): a. If the promoter is a listed entity, its directors other than the independent directors, its employees or its nominees shall be deemed to be related to it; b. If the promoter is an unlisted entity, its directors, its employees or its nominees shall be deemed to be related to it.\\\\\\\\u201d  (iii) For the purpose of the sub-clause (ii), the expression \\\\\\\\u2018independent director\\\\\\\\u2019 shall mean a non-executive director of the company who:  a. apart from receiving director\\\\\\\\u2019s remuneration, does not have any material pecuniary relationships or transactions with the company, its promoters, its directors, its senior management or its holding company, its subsidiaries and associates which may affect independence of the director;  b. is not related to promoters or persons occupying management positions at the board level or at one level below the board;  c. has not been an executive of the company in the immediately preceding three financial years; (emphasis supplied) d. is not a partner or an executive or was not partner or an executive during the preceding three years, of any of the following:  i) the statutory audit firm or the internal audit firm that is associated with the company, and   ii) the legal firm(s) and consulting firm(s) that have a material association with the company.  e. is not a material supplier, service provider or customer or a lessor or lessee of the company, which may affect independence of the director;  f. is not a substantial shareholder of the company i.e. owning two percent or  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 13 of 20  more of the block of voting shares; g. is not less than 21 years of age.\\\\\\\\u201d  24. I note that all the above-mentioned conditions are required to be satisfied and non-satisfaction of even one condition would render a director ineligible to be an Independent Director. With respect to the Noticee, I note that there is no material to show that he either does not meet or meets any of the conditions mentioned at points (a), (b), (d), (e) and (f), while he does meet the condition mentioned at point (g). However, as noted earlier, the Annual Report of the Company for the year 2012-13, designates him as an Executive Director and also refers to him as the Whole-Time Director and a Key Management Personnel as part of Related Party Disclosures. Therefore, it is clear that the Noticee held an \\\\\\\\u2018executive\\\\\\\\u2019 role in the Company in the year 2012-13 and if he did so, then, by virtue of the condition at point (c) above, he was not eligible to be an Independent Director in the Company for the next three financial years i.e., FY 2013-14, FY 2014-15 and FY 2015-16. I note here that the Annual Report for FY 2012-13 clearly designates the Noticee as an Executive Director and Key Management Personnel for VLFL and no material has been provided by the Noticee to show that he never received this report or that he has taken up the issue of his designation with the Company. Hence, I hold that the Noticee was not an \\\\\\\\u2018Independent Director\\\\\\\\u2019 in the Company in FY 2013-14 and FY 2014-15.  25. If he was a \\\\\\\\u2018Non-Executive Director\\\\\\\\u2019 in 2013-14 and 2014-15, then the same would be possible when he was reappointed as a \\\\\\\\u2018Non-Executive Director\\\\\\\\u2019 in the Annual General Meeting (AGM) held in September 2013. I note from the Annual Reports of 2012-13 and 2013-14 that no such resolution has been approved in the AGM of 2013-14. In fact, the Annual Report of 2013-14 mentions that in the AGM held on September 26, 2014, the Noticee will retire by rotation as he does not offer himself for re-appointment. Therefore, in the absence of any such records, there is a preponderance of probability that the Noticee has continued to act as an \\\\\\\\u2018Executive Director\\\\\\\\u2019 in FY 2013-14 and continued in that role till the time he chose to retire by rotation. In view of the above fact and circumstances, the inconsistent designations of \\\\\\\\u2018Non-Executive\\\\\\\\u2019 and \\\\\\\\u2018Independent\\\\\\\\u2019 Director mentioned against his name in the Annual Reports appear to be erroneous and therefore, not acceptable.  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 14 of 20  26. In view of the above, I am constrained to conclude that the Noticee was an Executive Director in the Company:  26.1. When the preferential allotment of shares to Looklike took place i.e., in FY 2013-14 and 26.2. When the off-market transfer of 1000 shares of VLFL took place from Looklike to Badriprasad Chiripal (August 14, 2014) i.e., before the date of his cessation from the Board of VLFL i.e., September 26, 2014.  27. However, as already mentioned above, even if it is accepted that he ceased to be a member of the Board from March 31, 2014/ June 17, 2014, i.e., prior to start of the investigation period, he was an Executive Director in VLFL when the preferential allotment of shares was made to Looklike i.e., when the pre-mediated scheme to manipulate the scrip price was already put in place.  28. While the fund transfer between VLFL and Looklike took place in January 2015 i.e., after the date of his cessation, I note that this fund transfer is not the only basis to allege connection between VLFL and Looklike. In view of the observations made at Paragraph 26 above, the Noticee was an Executive Director in VLFL when the pre-meditated scheme was put in place and therefore, he is also responsible for the acts of the Company.  29. The Noticee has not provided any concrete evidence to substantiate his claim that he was not involved in the affairs of the Company since 2011. With respect to his submission that in FY 2013-14, he was replaced in the Investor Grievance Committee of the Company, I note that the role of this committee is confined to resolving investor/ shareholder grievances and that the committee is not involved directly in the affairs of the Company. Hence, merely because he was replaced in the committee, it cannot be categorically said that the Noticee did not continue to be involved in the affairs of the Company or that he was not involved in decision making roles in the Company.   30. On the other hand, I note from documents uploaded to the MCA website that in the meeting of the Board of Directors held on May 20, 2014, resolutions were passed wherein the following documents were approved by the Board:  Order in the matter of Voltaire Leasing & Finance Limited   Page 15 of 20  30.1. The Annual Audited Financial Accounts for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2014, and  30.2. The report of the Board of Directors together with the Corporate Governance Report and Management Discussion & Analysis.  31. I note from the resolutions passed that the Noticee, in his capacity as a Director, along with the Managing Director of VLFL, was jointly and severally authorized to sign the above mentioned documents on behalf of the Board and to do all necessary acts to give effect to the resolutions. Management Discussion & Analysis is one of the vital piece of information placed before the Board for determination of strategy to be adopted by the Company going forward. The resolution indicates that the Noticee has been given the assignment for giving effect to the resolution, which includes deciding on the strategic way forward for the company.

             Page 1 of 9  WTM/GM/EFD-1 \\\\\\\\u2013 DRA-2/  73/2020-21   BEFORE THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA ORDER  Under Regulation 27(5) of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 in respect of Fin Brains Securities (India) Limited, registered Stock Broker - SEBI Registration Nos. INF/INE/INB 230753439 and INE 260753439 _____________________________________________________________________ 1. Background \\\\\\\\u2013 1.1. The present matter emanates from a letter dated August 28, 2015 from the National Stock Exchange (\\\\\\\\u201cNSE\\\\\\\\u201d), informing of the expulsion of Fin Brains Securities (India) Limited (the \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d/ \\\\\\\\u201cFin Brains\\\\\\\\u201d) from the membership of the NSE and notification dated September 19, 2015 of the Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cMSEI\\\\\\\\u201d) conveying the message of expulsion of the Noticee from the membership of the MSEI.   2. Enquiry proceedings against Fin Brains\\\\\\\\u2013 2.1. Consequent to the receipt of the above-mentioned letter/notification, Enquiry Proceeding was initiated against Fin Brains, a registered intermediary, in terms of  Order in the Matter of Fin Brains Securities (India) Limited                                              Page 2 of 9  the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 (the \\\\\\\\u201cIntermediaries Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d).  2.2. Pursuant to the said appointment, the DA issued an SCN dated June 13, 2018 bearing number EAD-09/SM/PR/17074/2018. The SCN called upon the Noticee to show cause as to why appropriate action should not be initiated in terms of Section 12 (3) of the SEBI Act read with Regulations 23 and 27 of the Intermediaries Regulations read with Regulation 25 (ii) of the SEBI (Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992 (the \\\\\\\\u201cBroker Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) for alleged violation of the following provisions of law, viz.\\\\\\\\u2014 Regulation 9 (a) (b), (f) of the Broker Regulations read with Regulation 27 (i), (viii), (xv), (xvii) of the Broker Regulations.  2.3. The SCN dated June 13, 2018 was sent by speed post to the Noticee at the address: 100/28, 1st Floor, Shiva Tower, Rajapur, Sector-9, Rohini, Delhi - 110085. The same was returned undelivered. Consequently, the SCN was affixed at the said address on July 16, 2018. The Noticee did not enter appearance before the DA in response to the SCN dated June 13, 2018 or file any reply.  2.4. The DA proceeded ex-parte and for the violations as stated above, the DA, in his report dated December 31, 2018 came out with the following findings \\\\\\\\u2014 a. The Noticee, by not holding the membership of any Stock Exchange, has failed to comply with the conditions stipulated in Regulations 9 and Regulation 23 (a) of the Intermediaries Regulations, thereby making it liable for action under Regulation 27 of the Intermediaries Regulations.  Order in the Matter of Fin Brains Securities (India) Limited                                              Page 3 of 9  b. There was nothing on record to suggest that the Noticee desired to get itself reinstated or it had taken any efforts in this regard. Also, there was no confirmation from NSE or MSEI that the Noticee had approached it for reinstating itself. On the contrary, the Noticee is shown as an expelled member as per the information available on NSE website. 2.5. Based on the above findings, the DA has recommended that in terms of Regulation 27 of the Intermediaries Regulations, the Certificate of Registration of Fin Brains Securities (India) Ltd, as a stock broker of MSEI and NSE (under certificate of Registration numbers INE 260753439 and INB/INF/INE 230753439) respectively be cancelled.  3. Post \\\\\\\\u2013 Enquiry SCN dated March 01, 2019 \\\\\\\\u2013 3.1. After  considering the  Enquiry  Report dated December 31, 2018, post \\\\\\\\u2013enquiry SCN dated  March 01, 2019 under  Regulation  28(1)  of  the Intermediaries  Regulations was  issued to  Fin Brains (enclosing therewith  a  copy  of  the  Enquiry  Report),  calling upon  it  to  show  cause  as  to  why  action  as recommended by the DA or any other penalty/direction should not be imposed on it in terms of Regulation 28 (1) and (2) of the Intermediaries Regulations, as deemed fit, by the Designated Member.  3.2. In this regard, opportunities of personal hearing before the Designated Member (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cDM\\\\\\\\u201d) were granted to the Noticee on September 23, 2020 and January 27, 2021. However, no appearance was entered by the Noticee on the above-mentioned dates. Further, no reply/written submission has  Order in the Matter of Fin Brains Securities (India) Limited                                              Page 4 of 9  been submitted by the Noticee in response to the post \\\\\\\\u2013 enquiry SCN dated March 01, 2019. 3.3. The details with respect to the service of the SCN and Hearing Notices to the Noticee are provided hereunder: Table-1 Sl. No. Noticee  Details 1.  Fin Brains Securities (India) Limited \\\\\\\\uf0a7 The post \\\\\\\\u2013enquiry SCN dated March 01, 2019 was sent by speed post to the said Noticee at the address:  100/28, 1st Floor, Shiva Tower, Rajapur, Sector-9, Rohini, Delhi - 110085. The same was returned  undelivered \\\\\\\\uf0a7 Newspaper publication was carried out intimating the personal hearing scheduled for September 23, 2020 in the Hindustan Times (English daily) and the Navbahrat Times (Hindi daily) in Mumbai and Delhi regions. \\\\\\\\uf0a7 Hearing Notice dated January 27, 2021 was emailed to the Noticee at the email address: 'finbrainsindia@hotmail.com'. \\\\\\\\uf0a7 Consequent to this, a reminder by way of an email dated January 20, 2021 was sent to the Noticee. \\\\\\\\uf0a7 Furthermore, by way of email dated January 22, 2021, the Noticee was provided the web link to join  Order in the Matter of Fin Brains Securities (India) Limited                                              Page 5 of 9  the hearing scheduled for January 27, 2021 through video conferencing.    4. Consideration of issues and findings \\\\\\\\u2013  4.1. In this regard, the record reveals that NSE expelled the Noticee at the meeting of its Disciplinary Action Committee (\\\\\\\\u201cDAC\\\\\\\\u201d) on August 10, 2015 in terms of Rule 1 of Chapter IV of the Rules of the Exchange. The DAC noted the following irregularities for the expulsion of the Noticee:  \\\\\\\\uf0a7 Mis-appropriation of client securities and funds towards own obligations. \\\\\\\\uf0a7 Non-Settlement of Funds and securities due to clients i.e, non-compliance with SEBI Requirement of running account of clients. \\\\\\\\uf0a7 Extending loans to certain entities who are not its clients. \\\\\\\\uf0a7 Failure to extend full co-operation and submit documents to NSE  4.2. It is further seen from the notification of MSEI that pursuant to the expulsion by NSE, MSEI had also expelled the Noticee vide its notification dated September 19, 2015.  4.3. The essential allegation that has emerged against the Noticee from the findings of the DA in his Enquiry Report dated December 31, 2018 is that as per Regulation 9(a) of the Broker Regulations, the registration of a stock broker is subject to the stock broker holding membership of any stock exchange. The Noticee having been expelled from the membership of the NSE and MSEI on August 28, 2015 and September 19, 2015 respectively, had failed to comply with the conditions specified  Order in the Matter of Fin Brains Securities (India) Limited                                              Page 6 of 9  in the Broker Regulations for the continuation of the Noticee as a registered stock broker. Accordingly, it has been alleged in the post-enquiry SCN that the Noticee has, as a consequence of being expelled from the NSE and MSEI, has failed to comply with the provisions of Regulation 9(a), (b), (f) and Regulation 23 (a) of the Intermediaries Regulations, and as such, liable for action under Regulation 27 of the Intermediaries Regulations. 4.4.  The relevant portions of the said provisions are provided hereunder:  BROKER REGULATIONS \\\\\\\\u201cCondition of Registration. Regulation 9. Any registration granted by the Board under Regulation 6 shall be subject to the following conditions, namely: (a) the stock broker holds the membership of any stock exchange; (b) he shall abide by the rules, regulations and bye-laws of the stock exchange which are applicable to him. (c )\\\\\\\\u2026 (f) he shall at all times abide by the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II; \\\\\\\\u201d.  INTERMEDIARIES REGULATIONS Cancellation or suspension of registration and other actions.  23. Where  any  person  who  has  been granted  a  certificate  of  registration  under  the  Act  or  regulations made thereunder, \\\\\\\\u2013  (a) fails to comply with any conditions subject to which a certificate of registration has been granted to him;  (b) \\\\\\\\u2026  Order in the Matter of Fin Brains Securities (India) Limited                                              Page 7 of 9  the Board may, without prejudice to any action under the securities laws or directions, instructions or  circulars  issued  thereunder,  by  order  take  such  action  in  the  manner  provided  under these regulations.  4.5. Thus, from the above it is seen that Regulation 9 requires that any person who has been granted registration as a stock-broker by SEBI is required to conform to the conditions prescribed therein. The said conditions inter alia being that the stock broker should hold the membership of any stock exchange; he shall abide by the rules, regulations and bye-laws of the stock exchange which are applicable to him; and he shall at all times abide by the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II. The Code of Conduct requires the stock-broker to maintain high standards of integrity, promptitude and fairness in the conduct of its business and act with due skill, care and diligence. The code also enumerates different kinds of duties that a stock-broker bears with respect to its clients. The DAC of NSE in its decision to expel the Noticee has noted that the expulsion of the Noticee was due to the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s mis-appropriation of client securities and funds towards own obligations; non-Settlement of Funds and securities due to clients and extension of  loan facilities to certain entities who were not its clients. The instant case is a follow up on the expulsion of the Noticee by the two exchanges where he was authorized to trade. Thus, even though a violation of the provisions of the code of conduct has been alleged, I do not intend to get into those details, for the purpose of this order.  The Noticee has neither entered appearance before me nor provided any reply in response to the post-enquiry SCN. So, there is nothing on record to show that there has been any change in the status of the Noticee in so far as the membership  Order in the Matter of Fin Brains Securities (India) Limited                                              Page 8 of 9  of the stock exchanges is concerned. The Noticee has, therefore, clearly failed to comply with the conditions of registration as required under Regulation 9 of the Broker Regulations. As a consequence of the above, Regulation 23 of the Intermediaries Regulations is triggered as Regulation 23 provides that in case any  person , who  has  been granted  a  certificate  of  registration  by SEBI, fails to comply with any conditions subject to which such registration was granted then SEBI may take  such  action as provided in the Intermediaries Regulations. 4.6. In view of the aforesaid, the Noticee is liable for suitable action under Regulation 27 of the Intermediaries Regulations.   5. Order \\\\\\\\u2013  5.1. I note that the DA has in the Enquiry Report recommended that the certificate of registration of the Noticee be cancelled. 5.2. I note that Regulation 28 including Regulation 28(2) of the Intermediaries Regulations was omitted by the SEBI (Intermediaries) (Amendment) Regulations, 2021, with effect from January 21, 2021.  Accordingly, as per the amended Regulation 27 of the Intermediaries Regulations, an appropriate order after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, may be passed by the DM under Regulation 27(5) of the Intermediaries Regulations. 5.3. Considering the violations brought out in the foregoing paragraphs, I, in exercise of powers conferred upon me in terms of Section 12(3) and Section 19 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 read with Regulations 23 and  Order in the Matter of Fin Brains Securities (India) Limited                                              Page 9 of 9  27(5) of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008, hereby direct that the Certificate of Registration of the Noticee i.e. Fin Brains Securities (India) Ltd, as a stock broker registered with SEBI with the registration nos. INF/INE/INB 230753439 and INE 260753439 be cancelled from the date of this order.  5.4. The order shall come into force with immediate effect. 5.5. A copy of this order shall be forwarded to the Noticee immediately. A copy of this Order shall also be forwarded to all the recognized stock exchanges and depositories.  Date:  February 15, 2021                                                         G.

Consideration and findings \\\\\\\\u2013  5.1. As already stated, the present proceedings have arisen pursuant to the complaints received from the shareholders for non-payment of dividend. From a perusal of the replies and submissions of Noticee Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, it is clear that the payment of dividend for the year 2011-12, declared on September 27, 2012, has not been made by the Company to the shareholders.  5.2. In this regard, it is stated that the SCN had included a list of investor complaints received against Midfield Industries as on February 13, 2013 as Annexure- I. The details of the said complaints are provided hereunder:  Order in the matter of Midfield Industries Limited.      Page 10 of 26  Table-2  Sl.

The status of the above mentioned complaints filed on SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s SCORES system was checked. It was observed that the said complaints have been closed with the assurance that the dividend would be paid in a short while. So, clearly the dividend declared has not been paid to the shareholders.  Order in the matter of Midfield Industries Limited.      Page 12 of 26  Invocation of SEBI Act for Violations of Provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 5.4. A preliminary ground of objection taken by the Noticees is that the invocation of provisions of SEBI Act is untenable in the present matter. It has been submitted that the SCN has been issued by SEBI by virtue of section 55A of Companies Act, 1956 for non-compliance as required of obligations and duties as enumerated under section 205(1A) and 207 of the Companies Act, 1956. Administration of these sections does not include imposition of new penalties that are not prescribed in the Companies Act 1956. Also, the above Noticees have submitted that the aforesaid position is reinforced by the fact that Section 24 of the Companies Act, 2013 expressly empowers SEBI to invoke powers under SEBI Act to take enforcement actions for violations of the provisions mentioned therein.  5.5. In this regard, it is relevant to place hereunder the provisions of Section 24 of the Companies Act, 2013: \\\\\\\\u201c24. Power of Securities and Exchange Board to regulate issue and transfer of securities, etc. (1) The provisions contained in this Chapter, Chapter IV and in section 127 shall,\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) in so far as they relate to \\\\\\\\u2014 (i) issue and transfer of securities; and (ii) non-payment of dividend, by listed companies or those companies which intend to get their securities listed on any recognised stock exchange in India, except as provided under this Act, be administered by the Securities and Exchange Board by making regulations in this behalf; (b) in any other case, be administered by the Central Government.  Explanation.\\\\\\\\u2014For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that all powers relating to all other matters relating to prospectus, return of allotment, redemption of preference shares and any other matter specifically provided in this Act, shall be exercised by the Central Government, the Tribunal or the Registrar, as the case may be.  Order in the matter of Midfield Industries Limited.      Page 13 of 26  (2) The Securities and Exchange Board shall, in respect of matters specified in subsection (1) and the matters delegated to it under proviso to sub-section (1) of section 458, exercise the powers conferred upon it under sub-sections (1), (2A), (3) and (4) of section 11, sections 11A, 11B and 11D of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992.\\\\\\\\u201d   Similarly Section 55A of the Companies Act, 1956 sates, 55A. POWERS OF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA \\\\\\\\u201c The provisions contained in sections 55 to 58, 59 to 81 (including sections 68A, 77A and 80A), 108, 109, 110, 112, 113, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 206, 206A and 207, so far as they relate to issue and transfer of securities and non-payment of dividend shall, - (a) in case of listed public companies ; (b) in case of those public companies which intend to get their securities listed on any recognised stock exchange in India, be administered by the Securities and Exchange Board of India ; and (c) in any other case, be administered by the Central Government. Explanation. - For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that all powers relating to all other matters including the matters relating to prospectus, statement in lieu of prospectus, return of allotment, issue of shares and redemption of irredeemable preference shares shall be exercised by the Central Government, the  [Tribunal] or the Registrar of Companies, as the case may be].\\\\\\\\u201d 5.6. The submission that SEBI could not have initiated the instant proceedings under the powers conferred on it under the Companies Act, 1956 is incorrect. Reference in this regard is drawn to Section 55A of the Companies Act, 1956, which provides powers to SEBI to administer certain provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. In this context, the relevant part, with respect to the non-payment of dividend is highlighted hereunder: \\\\\\\\u201cThe provisions contained in sections 55 to 58, 59 to 81 (including sections 68A, 77A and 80A), 108, 109, 110, 112, 113, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121,  Order in the matter of Midfield Industries Limited.      Page 14 of 26  122, 206, 206A and 207, so far as they relate to issue and transfer of securities and non-payment of dividend shall, - (a) in case of listed public companies ; (b) in case of those public companies which intend to get their securities listed on any recognised stock exchange in India, be administered by the Securities and Exchange Board of India\\\\\\\\u201d. Section 55A of the Companies Act, 1956 read with Sections 207 and 621 confer power on SEBI to prosecute the offence of non-payment of dividend. As such, when non-payment of dividend by a listed company is raised as an investor grievance, the same squarely falls within the ambit of the SEBI Act, in terms of Section 15 C thereof. Thus, I do not find any merit in the contention of the Noticee that SEBI had no explicit powers under the Companies Act, 1956 to deal with non-payment of dividend.  5.7. It is relevant to mention here that SEBI has initiated prosecution in respect of delay in payment of dividend by way of C.C. Sr. no. 1621/2020 (SEBI vs. Midfield Industries Ltd. & Ors.) before the Special Court for Economic Offences, Hyderabad for offence punishable under section 207 of the Companies Act, 1956. Further, multiple Orders have been passed by SEBI against the Company. A list of such Orders is provided hereunder: Table-3 Sl. No. Order  Penalty Imposed  1. ADJUDICATION ORDER NO.

EAD-7/BD/NR/2019-20/7083-85 dated February 28, 2020  in respect of Midfield Industries Limited, Madhu Mohan Reddy and Ashok Sagar Mudumba, in the matter of Midfield Industries Limited. The AO in the said Order concluded that Midfield Industries Limited, Madhu Mohan Reddy and Ashok Sagar Mudumba had violated the provisions of Regulations 3 (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4 (2) (f) and (k) of SEBI  (PFUTP)  Regulations,  2003  read  with  Section  12A  (a),  (b)  and (c)  of SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulation 57(1) of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations. Midfield Industries Limited \\\\\\\\u2013 Rs. 25,00,000 Madhu Mohan Reddy\\\\\\\\u2013 Rs. 10,00,000 Ashok Sagar Mudumba \\\\\\\\u2013 5,00,000   5.8. It is further mentioned that SEBI has initiated multiple recovery proceedings for the recovery of penalties imposed by way of the above orders. A list of such proceedings is provided hereunder:  Order in the matter of Midfield Industries Limited.      Page 18 of 26   Table-4  Sl. No. Recovery Proceedings Recovery Amount  1.

AO/JS/VRP/83/2018 dated January 31, 2018 on Madhu Mohan Reddy, in the matter of Midfield Industries Limited. Rs. 26,00, 452       Penalty: Rs. 25,00,000       Interest: Rs. 99,542       Recovery Cost: Rs. 1,000   2. Recovery Certificate No. RC 1496/2018 dated July 02, 2018 in Attachment Proceeding Nos. 3665 and 3666 of 2018 against Midfield Industries Limited with respect to the non-payment of penalty imposed in ADJUDICATION ORDER NO. AO/JS/VRP/ 84/2018 dated January 31, 2018 on Midfield Industries Limited, in the matter of Midfield Industries Limited. Rs. 20,87,795       Penalty: Rs. 20,00,000       Interest: Rs. 86,795       Recovery Cost: Rs. 1,000  Order in the matter of Midfield Industries Limited.      Page 19 of 26  5.9. It is seen from the above that the Company and its executive-directors, namely Madhu Mohan Reddy and Ashok Sagar Mudumba have a history of securities law violations and disregard for Orders passed pursuant to adjudication of such violations. As a consequence of this, SEBI had to initiate recovery proceedings as detailed above.  5.10. Furthermore, it is seen from the BSE website that the last Annual Report filed by the Company was for the financial year ending March 31, 2011. No Annual Report subsequent to this date has been filed by the Company. Also, as per the records available on the Ministry of Corporate Affairs\\\\\\\\u2019 (MCA) website, the last filed balance sheet of the Company is for the year ending March 31, 2011. Thus, it appears that after the financial year 2010-11, no documents have been filed by the Company either with the exchanges or the MCA that could reflect the financial condition of the Company.  5.11. It is stated that the complaints received by SEBI were in respect of non-payment of dividend declared for the financial year 2011-12. In this regard, reference is drawn to SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s letter dated February 13, 2013 and the reply of the Company dated February 25, 2013. From the above two letters, it is clear that the Company declared a total dividend of Rs. 3,20,53,128 for the financial year 2011-12 on September 27, 2012. Further, as per Section 205 (1A) and 207 of the Companies Act, 1956 the following schedule should have been followed by the Company:  Order in the matter of Midfield Industries Limited.      Page 20 of 26  Table- 5 Date by which dividend should have been transferred to a separate bank account  October 02, 2012 Date by which dividend should have been paid October 27, 2012 Dividend Amount (Rs.) Rs. 3,20,53,128 5.12.  It is clear that the dividend declared by the Company for the year 2011-12 should have been paid by October 27, 2012. However, the same was not done. The complaints which were lodged on SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s SCORES system were closed by the Company by stating that they were in the process of paying the dividend. This was in 2013. However, no document has been provided by the Company till now to show that any payment of dividend has been made to the shareholders. Thus, even after the lapse of more than 8 years, it appears that the shareholders have not been paid the dividend due to them. 5.13. The Company has taken the defence that its inability to pay dividend to the shareholders was due to the attachment of its properties and bank accounts. It is seen from the documents submitted by the Company that a notice dated November 07, 2012 was issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax Circle \\\\\\\\u2013 16(2), Hyderabad to the State Bank of Hyderabad claiming rights over the proceeds which may be received by the bank in furtherance of its own recovery proceedings against the Company. The Company was required to pay the dividend by October 27, 2012. The said event happened later than the date by which the Company was required to make dividend payment. Thus, I do not find it relevant  Order in the matter of Midfield Industries Limited.      Page 21 of 26  to consider subsequent events that may have caused certain constraints in the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s ability to make the dividend payment. Furthermore, Section 205 of the Companies Act, 1956, as reproduced hereunder, provides necessary guidance regarding the declaration and payment of dividend:   \\\\\\\\u201c205. DIVIDEND TO BE PAID ONLY OUT OF PROFITS  (1) No dividend shall be declared or paid by a company for any financial year except out of the profits of the company for that year arrived at after providing for depreciation in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) or out of the profits of the company for any previous financial year or years arrived at after providing for depreciation in accordance with those provisions and remaining undistributed or out of both or out of moneys provided by the Central Government or a State Government for the payment of dividend in pursuance of a guarantee given by that Government :  Provided that \\\\\\\\u2013  (a) if the company has not provided for depreciation for any previous financial year or years which falls or fall after the commencement of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1960, it shall, before declaring or paying dividend for any financial year provide for such depreciation out of the profits of that financial year or out of the profits of any other previous financial year or years ;  (b) if the company has incurred any loss in any previous financial year or years, which falls or fall after the commencement of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1960, then, the amount of the loss or an amount which is equal to the amount provided for depreciation for that year or those years whichever is less, shall be set off against the profits of the company for the year for which dividend is proposed to be declared or paid or against the profits of the company for any previous financial year or years, arrived at in both cases after providing for depreciation in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) or against both ; (c) the Central Government may, if it thinks necessary so to do in the public interest, allow any company to declare or pay dividend for any financial year out of the profits of the company for that year or any previous financial year or years without providing for depreciation :  Provided further that it shall not be necessary for a company to provide for depreciation as aforesaid where dividend for any financial year is declared or paid out of the profits of any previous financial year or years which falls or fall before the commencement of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1960.  Order in the matter of Midfield Industries Limited.      Page 22 of 26  (1A) The Board of directors may declare interim dividend and the amount of dividend including interim dividend shall be deposited in a separate bank account within five days from the date of declaration of such dividend.  (1B) The amount of dividend including interim dividend so deposited under sub-section (1A) shall be used for payment of interim dividend.

Thereafter, in terms of Rule 7(b) of SCR Adjudication Rules, the SCN along with the annexures mentioned therein were sent to the Noticee on December 15, 2020 through digitally signed email at the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s Email IDs: corporateserviced@yahoo.com ;nandanvancpl@gmail.com;  I note that the SCN sent through Email at one of the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s Email IDs viz., corporateserviced@yahoo.com bounced. However, the SCN was duly served on the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s another Email ID viz., nandanvancpl@gmail.com, since the Email did not bounce.   4. Vide the aforesaid Email dated December 15, 2020, the Noticee was given one more opportunity to file its reply to the charges alleged in the SCN by December 29, 2020, besides providing it with an opportunity of personal hearing on January 5, 2021. In view of Covid-19 Pandemic, the hearing was scheduled through videoconference on WebEx platform. The link for joining the hearing through videoconference on Webex platform along with the login credentials were sent to the Noticee through email on January 4, 2021. However, I note that the Noticee did not attend the hearing.   5. The Noticee vide email dated January 13, 2021 requested for one more opportunity of hearing, since the earlier opportunity accorded on January 5, 2020 could not be availed by it in view of illness of its Authorised  Adjudication Order in respect of Nandanvan Commercial Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 3 of 13  Representative. Accordingly, as requested by the Noticee, one more opportunity of hearing was provided to the Noticee on February 5, 2021, which was communicated vide Email dated February 1, 2021. Vide the said Email dated February 1, 2021, the Noticee was informed to provide the details of the person/s who is/are going to attend the hearing scheduled on February 5, 2021 so as to send the Webex link along with the login credentials, by February 4, 2021. I note that the Noticee did not respond to the Email dated February 1, 2021. Therefore, the hearing scheduled on February 5, 2021 could not be conducted due to non-furnishing of information by the Noticee. Thereafter, the Noticee was given final opportunity of hearing on February 9, 2021, which was communicated vide Email dated February 5, 2021. Vide the aforesaid Email dated February 5, 2021, the Noticee was informed that since it failed to furnish the details of the person/s who is/are going to attend the hearing earlier, the Webex link along with login credentials were mailed to it on February 5, 2021 at the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s Email ID: nandanvancpl@gmail.com. I note that the Noticee did not appear for the hearing scheduled on February 9, 2021.   6. I note from the above sequence of events that the Noticee despite providing with three opportunities of hearing, failed to avail the same. In view of the above, I am of the opinion that the SCN and the notices of hearing was duly served on the Noticee, yet the Noticee failed to submit its reply and also failed to avail the opportunity of hearing. I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been duly followed in the matter by providing sufficient opportunities to the Noticees to furnish it\\\\\\\\u2019s reply and to avail the opportunity of hearing.    7. In this context, I would like to rely upon the observations of The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in the matter of Classic Credit Ltd., vs. SEBI (Appeal  68 of 2003 decided on December 08, 2006) wherein the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, inter alia, observed that - \"............ the appellants did not file any reply to the second show-cause notice. This being so, it has to be  Adjudication Order in respect of Nandanvan Commercial Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 4 of 13  presumed that the charges alleged against them in the show-cause notice were admitted by them\\\\\\\\u201d.  8. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT has again in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Others vs SEBI (Appeal  68 of 2013 decided on February 11, 2014), interalia, observed that \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026As rightly contended by Mr. Rustomjee, learned senior counsel for respondents, appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted charges levelled against them in the show cause notices\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d.  9. In view of the above observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT and considering that no request has been received from the Noticee seeking more time for filing written reply or for personal hearing, I find no useful purpose would be achieved by granting any more opportunity of personal hearing to the Noticee, hence, I proceed to deal with matter ex-parte, based on materials available on record.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES   10. I have taken into consideration the facts and material available on record. I observe that the allegation levelled against Noticee is that it had carried out transfer of shares through off-market without receipt of consideration.  After perusal  of  the material  available  on  record,  I  have  the  following  issues  for consideration, viz.,  (I) Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Section 16 of SCRA, 1956 read with SEBI Notification G.S.R 219 (E) dated March 02, 2000, Section 13 and Section 18 of SCRA, 1956 read with Section 2(i) of SCRA, 1956.  Adjudication Order in respect of Nandanvan Commercial Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 5 of 13  (II) Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 23H of SCRA?  (III) If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 23J of SCRA? ISSUE-I: Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Section 16 of SCRA, 1956 read with SEBI Notification G.S.R 219 (E) dated March 02, 2000, Section 13 and Section 18 of SCRA, 1956 read with Section 2(i) of SCRA, 1956.  11. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of SCRA and SEBI Notification dated March 2, 2000, which reads as under:  Section 2 (i) of SCRA In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,\\\\\\\\u2014 spot delivery contract\\\\\\\\u201d means a contract which provides for,-  (a) actual delivery of securities and the payment of a price therefor either on the same day as the date of the contract or on the next day, the actual period taken for the despatch of the securities or the remittance of money therefor through the post being excluded from the computation of the period aforesaid if the parties to the contract do not reside in the same town or locality;  (b) transfer of the securities by the depository from the account of a beneficial owner to the account of another beneficial owner when such securities are dealt with by a depository  Section 13 of SCRA If the Central Government is satisfied, having regard to the nature or the volume of transactions in securities in any State or States or area that it is necessary so to do, it may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declared this section to apply to such State or States or area and thereupon every contract in such State or States or area which is entered into after the date of the notification otherwise than between members of a recognised stock exchange or recognised stock exchanges in such State or States or area or through or with such member shall be illegal.  Section 16 of SCRA If the Central Government is of opinion that it is necessary to prevent undesirable speculation in specified securities in any State or area, it may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare that no person in the State or area specified in the notification shall, save with the permission of the Central Government, enter into any contract for the sale or purchase of any security  Adjudication Order in respect of Nandanvan Commercial Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 6 of 13  specified in the notification except to the extent and in the manner, if any, specified therein.  Section 18 of SCRA Nothing contained in sections 13, 14, 15 and 17 shall apply to spot delivery contracts.  SEBI Notification G.S.R 219(E) dated March 2, 2000 \\\\\\\\u201cIn exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 16 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956), read with Government of India Notification No. S.O. 573(E), dated 30th July, 1992, (See [1992] 75 Comp Cas (St.) 216.) and Notification No. 183(E), dated 1st March, 2000, (See page 53 supra.) issued under section 29A of the said Act, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \"the Board\") being of the opinion that it is necessary to prevent undesirable speculation in securities in the whole of India, hereby declare that no person in the territory to which the said Act extends, shall, save with the permission of the Board, enter into any contract for sale or purchase of securities other than such spot delivery contract or contract for cash or hand delivery or special delivery or contract in derivatives as is permissible under the said Act or the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992), and the rules and regulations made under such Acts and rules, regulations and bye-laws of a recognised stock exchange   Provided that any contracts for sale or purchase of Government securities, gold related securities, money market securities and ready forward contracts in debt securities entered into on the recognised stock exchange shall be entered into in accordance with-   (a) the rules or regulations or the bye-laws made under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956), or the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992), or the directions issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India under the said Acts;   (b) the rules made or guidelines or directions issued under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934), or the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949) or the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (46 of 1973), by the Reserve Bank of India;   (c) the provisions contained in the notifications issued by the Reserve Bank of India under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956)   12. I note form the records that the Noticee was one of the Promoters of UGL. From the off\\\\\\\\u2013market data analysis, it is noted that the Noticee had transferred  Adjudication Order in respect of Nandanvan Commercial Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 7 of 13  6,00,000 shares of UGL to Chetan Dogra. The details of off-market transfers done by the Noticee are furnished hereunder:  Sl. No. Date of transaction Name  of the Entity/ Individual who had transferred the shares  Name of the Noticee who received the shares Rate (in \\\\\\\\u20b9) at which the shares were sold (transferred) No. of shares transferred Amount in \\\\\\\\u20b9 1 06/09/2010 Nandanvan Commercial Pvt., Ltd., Chetan Dogra 75 2,50,000 1,87,50,000 2 13/09/2010   100 3,50,000 3,50,00,000 Total  6,00,000 5,37,50,000  13. I note from the above table that that the Noticee had transferred 2,50,000 shares and 3,50,000 (totalling 6,00,000 shares) to Chetan Dogra on September 6, 2010 and September 13, 2010 respectively. As per the above table, the Noticee was to receive an amount of \\\\\\\\u20b95,37,50,000/- from Chetan Dogra towards consideration for sale of 6,00,000 shares. Further, I note from the records that there was no agreement entered into by the Noticee with Chetan Dogra. I also note from the records that the Noticee had received two cheques dated September 6, 2010 and September 30, 2010 from Chetan Dogra drawn on HDFC Bank, Mumbai branch for an amount of \\\\\\\\u20b91,87,50,000 and \\\\\\\\u20b93,50,00,000 respectively, which were subsequently returned by the Bank due to insufficient balance on December 4, 2010.  As per the extant statutory provisions governing dealing in securities which happens outside the market platform of a recognized stock exchange, the settlement relating to such transfer of securities and the payment of consideration required to be made against such transfer, shall have to be either on the same day or at the most next day. It is pertinent to note that the in respect of the off-market transaction dated September 13, 2010, the Noticee received a cheque from Chetan Dogra on September 30, 2020, which is after a delay of 17days from the date of transaction, which was subsequently dis-honoured by the Bank due to insufficient balance. I also note that in respect of the off-market  Adjudication Order in respect of Nandanvan Commercial Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 8 of 13  transaction dated September 6, 2010, the Noticee had presented the cheque for realisation which was dis-honoured by the Bank due to insufficient funds on December 4, 2010. Thus, it is seen that the Noticee did not receive any consideration from Chetan Dogra towards sale of 6,00,000 shares of UGL in off-market.   14. I am of the view that for off-market transaction to be executed successfully, the buyer and seller should know each other and subsequently negotiate the price and quantity of the shares to be transacted. It is pertinent to note that the value of the off-market transactions done by the Noticee is substantial, yet the Noticee failed to enter into any agreement with the entities. In the instant case, the Noticee being a Promoter of UGL had transferred 6,00,000 shares worth \\\\\\\\u20b95,37,50,000/- without receipt of any consideration and without entering into any agreement  Thus, I note that the Noticee had admittedly sold 6,00,000 shares to Chetan Dogra without consideration.   15. For the sake of assumption, if the Noticee gave the shares as loan to Chetan Dogra then it should have followed the procedure as laid down in the Depositories Act, 1996 and SEBI (Depositories and Depository Participants) Regulations, 1996 along with the relevant Bye-laws prescribed by the Depositories. However, in the instant case, I note that the Noticee followed no such procedure. I also note from the records that pursuant to receipt of shares in off-market from the Noticee, Chetan Dogra has further sold in the market.   16. Another significant factor to be noted is that the shares were transferred to the demat account of Chetan Dogra, which implies transfer of beneficial ownership of the shares. The transfer of beneficial ownership comes along with the rights and liabilities attached to the ownership of shares. The conduct of the parties, which is important in any transaction, establishes that there was a transfer of the shares. The conduct of the parties and nature of the transactions establishes that the Noticee had entered into a transaction  Adjudication Order in respect of Nandanvan Commercial Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 9 of 13  in off-market, without receipt of consideration, which is in contravention of the provisions relating to spot delivery contracts.   17. In this regard, I would like to draw reference to Section 16 of SCRA, which provides that if the Central Government is of opinion that it is necessary to prevent undesirable speculation in specified securities in any State or area, it may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare that no person in the State or area specified in the notification shall, save with the permission of the Central Government, enter into any contract for the sale or purchase of any security specified therein. Sub section of section 16 declares that all contracts in contravention of the provisions of sub section (1) entered into after the date of the notification issued thereunder shall be illegal. The central Government had issued a notification in the year 1969, and thereafter SEBI issued a similar Notification on March 2, 2000 in exercise of its delegated authority under section 16 of SCRA prohibiting any person in the territory of India to enter into any contract for sale or purchase of securities other than spot delivery or contract for cash or hand delivery or special delivery or contract in derivatives as is permissible under SCRA or the Act and the Rules and Regulations made there under and Rules, Regulations and Bye laws of a recognized stock exchange. In other words, the prohibition contained in the Notification means that no security could be traded in an off market transaction except by way of spot delivery contract as defined in section 2(i) of SCRA. Further this was made applicable to the whole of India vide notification dated SO 3644 dated November 29, 1962.   18. As per SEBI Notification G.S.R 219(E) dated 2nd March, 2000 no person in the territory to which SCRA extends, shall, save with the permission of SEBI, enter into any contract for sale or purchase of securities other than such spot Delivery contract or contract for cash or hand delivery or special delivery or contract in derivatives as is permissible under the said SCRA or the SEBI Act and the rules and regulations made under such Acts and rules, regulations and bye\\\\\\\\u2010laws of a recognized stock exchange.  Adjudication Order in respect of Nandanvan Commercial Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 10 of 13  19. In terms of Section 13 of SCRA, any transactions in securities in an area other than between the members of a recognized stock exchange or through or with such member will be illegal, except spot delivery contracts. In the instant case, I note that the transactions carried out by the Noticee are not spot delivery contract.   20. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in its order dated July 17, 2007 in the matter of Alok Kehtan Vs. SEBI, Appeal No. 55 of 2007, upheld that:  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..it is clear that the appellant sold his unlisted shares on 25.08.1999         in an off market transaction and received the sale consideration of `\\\\\\\\u20b922,50,000/\\\\\\\\u2010 only in January, 2000 which is much beyond the time permitted  by section 2(i) of the SCRA. Since the transaction was off market the contract for the sale of shares could only be by way of spot delivery in view of the restriction imposed by the Board under section 16 of SCRA which mandates that the sale consideration ought to have been received either on the same day of the transaction or on the following day. It is, thus, clear that the sale of shares by the appellant on 25.08.1999 in the off market transaction is violative of the restriction imposed under section 16 read with section 2(i) of SCRA.\\\\\\\\u201d  21. If the facts of the present case are tested with the touchstone of the observations made by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, it is evident that the 6,00,000 shares sold by the Noticee to Chetan Dogra in off\\\\\\\\u2010market deal i.e., outside the stock exchange mechanism, against no consideration is not in conformity with the provisions of section 2(i) of SCRA. Therefore, I am of the view that the said transactions are illegal, void and a nullity and consequently in contravention of SEBI Notification G.S.R 219(E) dated March 2, 2000 and provisions of Section 13, 16 and 18 of SCRA.   22. Consequently, I hold that the allegation of violation of the provisions of Section 16 of SCRA, 1956 read with SEBI Notification G.S.R 219 (E) dated March 02, 2000, Section 13 and Section 18 of SCRA, 1956 read with Section 2(i) of SCRA, 1956 by the Noticee stands established.  Adjudication Order in respect of Nandanvan Commercial Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 11 of 13  ISSUE \\\\\\\\u2013 II: Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 23H of SCRA? 23. It is established from the foregoing paragraphs that the Noticee had carried out transfer of shares through off-market without receipt of consideration and thereby violated the provisions of Section 16 of SCRA, 1956 read with SEBI Notification G.S.R 219 (E) dated March 2, 2000, Section 13 and Section 18 of SCRA, 1956 read with Section 2(i) of SCRA, 1956. Since the aforesaid violations stands established against the Noticee, the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under Section 23H of SCRA.  24. The provisions of Section 23H of SCRA are reproduced hereunder. Section 23H of SCRA - Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided.   Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or articles or bye- laws or the regulations of the recognised stock exchange or directions issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees.  ISSUE \\\\\\\\u2013 III: If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 23J of SCRA? 25. While determining the quantum of monetary penalty under Section 23H of SCRA, I have considered the factors stipulated in Section 23J of SCRA, which reads as under:  Section 23J of SCRA - Factors to be taken into account by the Adjudicating Officer   While  adjudging  quantum  of  penalty  under  section  23-I (SCRA),  the  Adjudicating  Officer  shall have due regard to the following factors, namely: (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default;  Adjudication Order in respect of Nandanvan Commercial Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 12 of 13  (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default;  (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  26. The material made available on record has not quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee and the loss suffered by the investors as a result of the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s default. There is also no material made available on record to assess the amount of loss caused to investors or the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee as a result of default.   27. However, I find that the Noticee had carried out off-market transfer of 6,00,000 shares, without receipt of consideration to Chetan Dogra, who upon receipt of shares have sold the shares in the market. Considering the large number of shares involved in such dubious deals and that the shares were sold outside the mechanism of stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Law, I am of the view that the Noticee should be penalised suitably for the said acts of omissions and commissions.  ORDER 28. In view of the foregoing, after taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances and in exercise of power conferred upon me under Section 23I of SCRA read with Rule 5 of SCR Adjudication Rules, I hereby impose a penalty of \\\\\\\\u20b910,00,000/- (Rupees Ten lakhs only) on the Noticee i.e., Nandanvan Commercial Pvt., Ltd., under Section 23H of SCRA.   29. The said penalty imposed on the Noticee, as mentioned above is commensurate with the violation committed by the Noticee and acts as a deterrent factor for the Noticee and others in protecting the interest of investors.  30. The Noticee shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days from the date of receipt of this Order, either by way of Demand Draft in favour of  Adjudication Order in respect of Nandanvan Commercial Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 13 of 13  \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR through online payment facility available on the SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in on the following path by clicking on the payment link.

Further, Risk Profiling Form (\\\\\\\\u201cRPF\\\\\\\\u201d), KYC, Invoices/Receipts issued to clients, Suitability Policy, etc., were sought from the entity. However, Sai Proficient failed to submit any document till date. Hence, the examination was conducted based on analysis of the details available on the archives of website of Sai Proficient, complaints filed by the complainants against Sai Proficient and documents attached with complaints,etc. Based on the examination of documents / information, SEBI prima facie observed the following:  2.1.

Promising Assured Returns to its Clients  5.1. It is noted from the complaints that Sai Proficient was promising assured/expected profit /returns on the investments made by the clients and luring them to avail its services. It is noted that huge returns were promised to the clients. Further, the following features of various products are noted from the archives of website of Sai Proficient: Service/Product name Service/Product\\\\\\\\u2019s feature Stock Cash We are proud to say that we offer stock cash options that are more than 95% accurate and end up in sure profits for our clients.

From the above it is noted that Sai Proficient induces clients to buy its services/products by claiming \\\\\\\\u201csure profits\\\\\\\\u201d. 5.2. It is noted from the e-mail communication between IA and its clients that Sai Proficient was promising assured/expected returns on the investments made by the clients on the call/tips given by IA. Some examples of assured/expected returns/profit offered to its clients are as under: 5.2.1. E-mail communication of IA with Mr.Sameer Mahawar (complainant) wherein it is stated as follows: \\\\\\\\u201cTotal paid amount Rs.525001/-, Total remaining Rs.1000000/-  \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026 What we will provide:- -Focused to consistent profit -maintain risk reward ratio\\\\\\\\u2026 As in offer\\\\\\\\u2026__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory                                                                                       Page 7 of 19 As per conversation with our executive Join our (COMMETMENT PLAN + VOLUME + OFFER FOR SALE) services We will give you good Total profit (expected 88,00,000).

E-mail communication between IA and Mr. Shyamsundar Virmani (Complainant): Vide complaint dated January 07, 2019 Mr. Virmani stated that he had paid Rs.5 lacs to Sai Proficient but never got promised return. He has submitted copy of email and service proposal received from email id saiproficientinvestment@gmail.com dated August 13, 2018 wherein it is stated as follows:  \\\\\\\\u201cEquity service charge:- 500000(inclusive GST) As in offer\\\\\\\\u2026 \\\\\\\\u2026. Join our equity commitment services only in 500000/-. You will get 90-95% accuracy in our levels rest is in installment after profit. We will give you good profit (depends upon market). You also know that there of 90 trading session. In this service we give approx. INR 8 lac profit and which we will give all support required.\\\\\\\\u201d  5.3. From the above communication, it is prima facie, noted that Sai Proficient is claiming expected profit on the investment amount, and in some cases sure profit, if the client avails IA\\\\\\\\u2019s services.  Sai Proficient, being a SEBI registered intermediary, is well aware that any form of returns, whether probable/ expected, cannot be committed or indicated for any investment service/ product since all investments in the securities market are subject to market risks. There may be a scenario where the capital deployed by the investor gets eroded as the investment advice provided by the IA turns out to be incorrect due to market risk.  Even if there are disclaimers, its conduct of claiming \\\\\\\\u201cexpected/ sure profits\\\\\\\\u201d  reveal its actual intent of luring investors to avail its services. If its objective was not to mislead investors, it should not have made such reckless and careless claims.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory                                                                                       Page 8 of 19 5.4. It is further observed that the company has claimed that its accuracy is more than 90% in providing stock market tips. The same is prima facie not supported by any evidence as available on the webpages of the company. Even if it were true, it is prima facie observed that the conduct of the company in claiming that its accuracy is more than 80% in providing stock market tips and it has best growth in capital on consistent basis is not a full disclosure and is an active concealment of the material fact that past performance is not a guarantee of future result. In other words, historical performance, even if true, when presented, is purely for reference purposes and it is inaccurate to simply assume that these will extend into the future. Every investment in the market is subject to market risk and any investment made by the client can also run into losses and even become zero. Considering the dynamics of the market, the returns from the investment in the market are unpredictable, no matter how much and for how long the investment is made. Any information that is put out for the consumption of its existing and prospective clients has to be done with great responsibility and should be of such  nature that it enables investors to take reasoned and unbiased decisions regarding their investment. This act of the IA  prima facie appears to be an attempt to induce the client to subscribe to its advisory service by claiming profit numbers, which prima facie is an act to mislead the client as full disclosure is not made by the IA that the proposed investment of the client may incur loss. This act, prima facie, appears to have been done with an intention to bring in more customers and thereby increasing the income of the IA.    5.5. The above conduct shows that Sai Proficient acted in a dishonest manner and did not act in the best interest of the clients. In view of the above, Sai Proficient and its Proprietor Ms. Meeshika Vishwakarma, prima facie, (a) failed in their responsibility to act in fiduciary capacity for their clients which is entrusted upon her under regulation 15 (1) of IA Regulations and (b) failed to abide by clauses 1 and 2 of Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15 (9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Sai Proficient and its Proprietor Ms. Meeshika Vishwakarma have, prima facie, violated regulation 15(1), clauses 1 and 2 of Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations.    6. Non Redressal of Investor Grievances and Non Cooperation:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory                                                                                       Page 9 of 19 6.1. Regulation 21 of IA Regulations mandates that IA shall redress clients\\\\\\\\u2019 grievances promptly. Further, SEBI, has vide Circular CIR/OIAE/2014 dated December 18, 2014 regarding Investor grievances through SCORES platform has advised that all SEBI registered intermediaries shall review their investors grievances redressal mechanism so as to further strengthen it and correct the existing shortcomings, if any. The SEBI registered intermediaries, to whom complaints are forwarded through SCORES, shall take immediate efforts on receipt of a complaint, for its resolution, within thirty days. Further, the said circular has stated that in case of failure by SEBI registered intermediaries to file Action Taken Report (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cATR\\\\\\\\u201d) under SCORES within thirty days of date of receipt of the grievance, it shall be treated as failure to furnish information to SEBI and deemed to constitute non-redressal of investor grievance.  6.2. It is observed from the data obtained from SCORES that 28 complaints are pending against Sai Proficient as on February 2021. Out of these complaints, it is seen that in 08 complaints, IA has failed to file ATR within prescribed timeline of 30 days, violating the directions given in the SEBI Circular CIR/OIAE/2014 dated December 18, 2014.   6.3. The details of pending complaints in which IA had filed ATR after 30 days and complaints in which Sai Proficient has not yet filed any reply from the date of last communication (as on February 03, 2021) are as follows:  Sr. No.  SCORES Complaint number  Name of Complainant  Date of receipt of complaint  Date of forwarding the complaint to IA (X)  Date of Final ATR (Y)  Excessive time above 30 days *   1  SEBIE/MP19/0003195/1 Kulwinder Singh 24/12/2019 01/01/2020 Not Submitted 399 2 SEBIE/MP19/0003078/1 Gyan Shankar Shukla 23/12/2019 26/12/2019 Not Submitted 405 3 SEBIP/MP19/0000406/1 Jitendra Kumar Yadav 31/10/2019 05/11/2019 29/01/2020 55 4 SEBIE/MP19/0002096/1 Hardev Singh 29/08/2019 07/10/2019 30/01/2020 85 5 SEBIE/MP19/0002003/1 Ajim Sattar Patave 21/08/2019 04/10/2019 29/01/2020 87__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory                                                                                       Page 10 of 19 Sr. No.  SCORES Complaint number  Name of Complainant  Date of receipt of complaint  Date of forwarding the complaint to IA (X)  Date of Final ATR (Y)  Excessive time above 30 days *   6 SEBIE/MP19/0001894/1 Sumit Kumar 04/08/2019 07/08/2019 Not Submitted 546 7 SEBIE/MP19/0000421/1 Ramkesh Sharma 16/01/2019 19/02/2019 11/04/2019 21 8 SEBIE/MP18/0004611/1 Arun Mandal 20/11/2018 20/11/2018 14/01/2019 25  6.4. I am of the view that investor grievance redressal mechanism is an important tool in the hands of SEBI to discharge its duties and obligations imposed on it under SEBI Act. One of the most important objects of SEBI is to protect the interest of investors and the same undoubtedly includes timely redressal of grievances of investors. Since, the IA has not submitted the ATR in a time bound manner as prescribed by SEBI and has also not resolved investors\\\\\\\\u2019 grievance, prima facie it is held that the IA has failed to comply with SEBI Circular CIR/OIAE/2014 dated December 18, 2014 and regulation 21(1) of IA Regulations. Thus, Sai Proficient has prima facie violated the provision of Regulation 21 (1) of IA Regulations and SEBI Circular CIR/OIAE/2014 dated December 18, 2014.  Non-cooperation by Sai Proficient 6.5. As per Regulation 25 (1) and (2) an Investment Adviser is mandated to produce to the inspecting authority such books, accounts and other documents in his custody or control and furnish him with such statements and information as required by the inspecting authority for the purposes of inspection. An Investment Adviser and any other associate person who is in possession of relevant information pertaining to conduct and affairs of the investment adviser is mandated to give to the inspecting authority all such assistance and extend all such co-operation as required in connection with the inspection and furnish such information as sought by the inspecting authority in connection with the inspection.  6.6. I note that SEBI, vide letter dated January 15, 2020, informed Sai Proficient that an inspection of its books of accounts/ records and other documents pertaining to its__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory                                                                                       Page 11 of 19 registration as an investment advisor would be carried out by SEBI.  As part of the said inspection, IA was advised to provide the information sought vide questionnaire. In response, Sai Proficient vide letter dated January 27, 2020 inter alia informed that due to personal reasons the working of the business was stopped and office had closed since December 31, 2019 and no new client was offered service since January, 2020 and they are providing only services to the existing clients and they focus on the complaints pending in SCORES. Vide the said letter the IA sought extension of time to furnish the required information to SEBI.  6.7. Subsequently, SEBI, vide letter dated February 04, 2020 once again informed Sai Proficient that inspection of the books of accounts and other records shall commence from February 17, 2020 onwards and sought information as per the questionnaire. SEBI also informed Ms. Meeshika Vishwakarma that if she is unable to be present during SEBI inspection, she is advised to depute a person to represent Sai Proficient during inspection. However, I note that Sai Proficient did not co-operate with  SEBI nor furnished any information sought by SEBI as part of the inspection which is prima facie found to be violative of Regulation 25 (1) and (2). 6.8. Though Ms. Meeshika Vishwakarma informed that they are providing proper services to the existing clients and focus on the complaints pending in SCORES, I note that currently, 28 investor complaints are pending against Sai Proficient in SCORES. The said fact belies the claim of Ms. Meeshika Vishwakarma that she is providing proper services to its clients. I also note that Ms. Meeshika Vishwakarma had stated that the office of Sai Proficient is closed. Therefore, investors have no means to physically approach Sai Proficient for any reasons arising out of their agreement with the IA, including for seeking their redressal of grievances. Moreover, from a regulatory perspective, functioning of office of IA is prima facie important as SEBI undertakes inspection of books of accounts, records and documents of registered intermediaries which can be done at the office premises. It brings to light whether IA is conducting its affairs within the confines of IA Regulations which are framed for investor protection. Any deficiencies / irregularities observed during the inspection enables the IA to improve its functioning and serve the clients, professionally and competently apart from the possible enforcement actions against them. However, in__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory                                                                                       Page 12 of 19 the present matter, Sai Proficient has prima facie not cooperated with SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s examination/inspection. The same not only prima facie demonstrates that Sai Proficient is trying to evade SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s jurisdiction despite pending investor complaints.  6.9. I note that the inspection of Sai Proficient was ordered during January-February, 2020 which is prior to the declaration of lockdown due to Covid-19 Pandemic. Further furnishing of information sought vide questionnaire could have been done especially after considerable period of time has elapsed and normalcy has largely resumed. Hence I am of the view that nationwide lockdown due to the Covid-19 Pandemic cannot be cited as reason for the non-cooperation by Sai Proficient by not providing the information.  6.10. I note that the certificate of IA has been issued to Sai Proficient. As per regulation 13 of IA Regulations, the certificate granted under regulation 9 of IA Regulations, inter alia is subject to the condition that the IA shall abide by the provisions of IA Regulations.   Thus, the liability is on Sai Proficient to comply with the provisions of IA Regulations which Sai Proficient has prima facie, failed to comply as noted in the preceding paragraphs. 6.11.  In view of the above, it is prima facie found that Sai Proficient has failed to furnish information relating to its activity as an IA for Inspection as required by the Board and not cooperated with SEBI for carrying out the objectives of inspection. Thereby Sai Proficient and its Proprietor Ms. Meeshika Vishwakarma has prima facie violated Regulations 13(a), 25(i) and (ii) of IA Regulations read with clause 8 of Code of Conduct for IA as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations.   ISSUE No. 2:  Whether Sai Proficient has, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act read with PFUTP Regulations?  7. In the instant matter, it is prima facie found that: 7.1. Sai Proficient has been giving assurance regarding expected returns/sure profits from securities markets to clients and luring them to buy its services.   7.2. Sai Proficient has not resolved the investor grievances as per SEBI prescribed timelines and not cooperated with SEBI during the examination/inspection.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory                                                                                       Page 13 of 19  8. As per Regulation 3 of PFUTP Regulation, no person (including an IA) shall directly or indirectly use or employ any scheme or device to defraud in connection with dealing in securities; or engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates as fraud or deceit upon any person (clients) in connection with any dealing in securities in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.  9. The modus operandi adopted by IA discussed hereinabove, prima facie, shows that IA was actually not practicing investment advisory in the manner envisaged under the IA Regulations, which essentially would involve advising the client considering his/ her financial situation, risk appetite, financial goal, etc. However, it is prima facie found that IA is knowingly and in a deceitful manner promising expected returns/sure profit to its clients.   10. It is also noted that the IA is not resolving clients\\\\\\\\u2019 grievances as per prescribed timelines and not cooperated with SEBI for inspection.  11. The above activities, prima facie, are the devices adopted by the IA to defraud its clients in connection with their dealings in the securities. Hence, IA is prima facie running a scheme and defrauding its clients, with an intention to maximize its income through advisory fees by employing above said devices, without caring for client\\\\\\\\u2019s needs and keeping its own interest ahead of its client\\\\\\\\u2019s interest.  12. Thus, the findings of the preliminary examination and the overall modus operandi discussed in this order, prima facie, shows that a scheme is knowingly employed by Sai Proficient to defraud its clients in connection with their dealings in the securities and to maximize its revenue generation at clients\\\\\\\\u2019 expense. Thus, the above discussed non-genuine and deceptive activities of IA are, prima-facie fraudulent and are covered under the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d under regulation 2(1)(c) of the PFUTP Regulations. Thus, Sai Proficient through its fraudulent act / scheme as discussed above, has prima facie violated the provisions of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the PFUTP Regulations.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory                                                                                       Page 14 of 19   ISSUE No. 3: If the answer to Issue No. 1 or 2 is in the affirmative, who is responsible for the violations?  13. I note that Ms. Meeshika Vishwakarma is the sole proprietor of Sai Proficient. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in Ashok Transport Agency vs. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business. .

In respect of: Ambuja Electro Castings Limited      Failure to obtain SCORES Authentication and to redress investor grievances  FACTS OF THE CASE    1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as SEBI) had issued a Circular no CIR/OIAE/2/2011 dated June 3, 2011 for inter alia obtaining authentication on SEBI Complaints Redress System (hereinafter referred to as SCORES) for processing investor complaints received by SEBI and advised all companies whose shares are listed on various stock exchanges to comply with the provisions of the said circular. Thereafter, SEBI issued another Circular no. CIR/OIAE/1/2012 dated August 13, 2012 advising all listed companies to obtain SCORES authentication by September 14, 2012. Subsequently, SEBI, vide Circular no. CIR/OIAE/1/2013 dated April 17, 2013, directed the listed companies, which had not obtained SCORES user id and password to do the same. The circular further stated that failure to obtain SCORES user ID and password within 30 days of issue of the circular, would be deemed to be willful avoidance of the same. Further, SEBI Circular no CIR/OIAE/1/2014 dated December 18, 2014 consolidated the aforesaid three circulars and rescinded the said circulars. However, it was clarified at para 15 of the Circular CIR/OIAE/1/2014 dated December 18, 2014 that notwithstanding such rescission, anything done or any action taken or any failure to take action under those Circulars before the date of issuance of this Adjudication Order in respect of Ambuja Electro Castings Limited for failure to obtain SCORES Authentication and for failure to redress investor grievances                                                Page 2 of 9  Circular, shall be deemed to have been done or taken or commenced under the provisions of this Circular.  2. It was observed by SEBI that Ambuja Electro Castings Limited (hereinafter referred to as Noticee/you) had failed to obtain the SCORES authentication and had also failed to redress investor grievances. Therefore, the Noticee allegedly failed to comply with the aforesaid SEBI Circulars. In view of the same, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings against the Noticee.  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 3. SEBI appointed Shri D Sura Reddy as Adjudicating Officer (AO), vide Order dated May 29, 2014 under section 15-I of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the SEBI Act, 1992) read with (r/w) rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as Adjudication Rules, 1992) to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions of sections 15C and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992, for the alleged failure on the part of the Noticee to obtain SCORES authentication and also to redress investor grievances. The matter was then transferred to Shri Amar Navlani, who was appointed as the AO vide order dated December 09, 2014. Subsequently, the undersigned has been appointed as the AO vide Order dated October 21, 2020.    SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 4. A Show Cause Notice having reference no. EAD-2/DSR-VVK/20244/2014 dated July 14, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as SCN) was issued by the previous AO to the Noticee at the address i.e. Ambuja house, 297, Patliputra Colony, Patna, Bihar-800013 through Speed post acknowledgement due (SPAD). The SCN was issued to the Noticee under the provisions of rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules, 1995 to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against the Noticee and why penalty should not be imposed on the Noticee under sections 15C and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992, for the alleged failure on the part of the Noticee to obtain SCORES authentication Adjudication Order in respect of Ambuja Electro Castings Limited for failure to obtain SCORES Authentication and for failure to redress investor grievances                                                Page 3 of 9  and also to redress investor grievances. The aforesaid SCN was sent through SPAD and the same was returned undelivered. In terms of provision of rule 7 of the Adjudication Rules, 1995, an attempt was made by the earlier AO to make affixture of SCN at the aforesaid address, vide letter dated October 16, 2017. However, the same was not affixed as the addressee of the aforesaid address did not allow to affix the SCN, since they did not know about the Noticee. Upon appointment of AO in the instant matter, the said SCN was also uploaded on the SEBI website (www.sebi.gov.in) under the head \\\\\\\\u201cEnforcement-Unserved Summons/Notices\\\\\\\\u201d. A Public Notice was also given in the Newspapers \\\\\\\\u2013 Patna Editions namely The Hindustan Times (English Language) and Dainik Bhaskar (Hindi Language), which was published on January 05, 2021 advising the Noticee to submit its reply within 14 days from the date of publication and to appear for personal hearing on January 22, 2021. However, neither did the Noticee appear on the date scheduled for the personal hearing, nor has the Noticee filed any reply to the said SCN.  5. Taking into account the aforesaid facts, I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been followed in the matter by granting the Noticee opportunities for replying to the SCN and of being heard. However, the Noticee has failed to avail the same. Therefore, I deem it appropriate to decide the matter on the basis of facts/material available on record.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES, EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS  6. After perusal of the material available on record, the issues that arise for consideration are:  a) Whether the Noticee has failed to obtain SCORES authentication and redress investor grievances? b) If yes, whether the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under sections 15C and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992? c) If yes, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed duly taking into account the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992? Adjudication Order in respect of Ambuja Electro Castings Limited for failure to obtain SCORES Authentication and for failure to redress investor grievances                                                Page 4 of 9  7. On perusal of the material available on record and giving regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I record my findings hereunder:  Issue (a): Whether the Noticee has failed to obtain SCORES authentication and redress investor grievances?  a) It is alleged in the SCN that the Noticee failed to obtain SCORES authentication and also failed to redress six (6) investor grievances and hence violated the aforesaid SEBI Circulars. SEBI commenced its web-based investor grievance redressal portal, SCORES, in June, 2011 to enhance investor protection. Investors can lodge their complaint against listed companies \\\\\\\\u2018on-line\\\\\\\\u2019 or in physical mode and monitor its status. Complaints received by SEBI in SCORES are electronically forwarded to the listed company / its Share Transfer Agent, which in turn is required to redress the same and furnish the ATR in electronic form. However, as a prerequisite to access SCORES portal, listed companies have to do SCORES authentication for obtaining user ID and login password from SEBI. The foregoing was spelt out in the SEBI Circular No. CIR/OIAE/2/2011 dated June 03, 2011 which also provided the format for listed companies to provide information for obtaining authentication. Thereafter, SEBI circular No. CIR/OIAE/1/2012 dated August 13, 2012, inter alia, reiterated the contents of the circular dated June 03, 2011 and fixed September 14, 2012 as the last date for obtaining SCORES authentication.  b) Subsequently, SEBI Circular No. CIR/OIAE/1/2013 dated April 17, 2013, inter alia, reiterated the contents of circular dated June 03, 2011 and stated that if SCORES authentication was not obtained within 30 days, it would not only be deemed as non-redressal of investor grievances, but also indicate willful avoidance of the same. The aforesaid SEBI Circular dated April 17, 2013 also stated that failure by the companies to file ATR within 30 days from the date of receipt of the complaints/grievances may attract penal action from SEBI. Further, SEBI Circular no CIR/OIAE/1/2014 dated December 18, 2014 consolidated the aforesaid three circulars and Adjudication Order in respect of Ambuja Electro Castings Limited for failure to obtain SCORES Authentication and for failure to redress investor grievances                                                Page 5 of 9  rescinded the said circulars. However, it was clarified at para 15 of the Circular CIR/OIAE/1/2014 dated December 18, 2014 that notwithstanding such rescission, anything done or any action taken or any failure to take action under those Circulars before the date of issuance of this Circular, shall be deemed to have been done or taken or commenced under the provisions of this Circular  c) Now, the first issue for consideration is whether the Noticee violated the provisions of the aforesaid SEBI Circulars by failing to obtain SCORES authentication and redress investor grievances. I note that the said SEBI circulars are addressed to all companies whose securities are listed on the Stock Exchanges and directed to obtain SCORES authentication, redress investor grievances and file Action Taken Report (ATR) on SCORES within thirty days of date of receipt of the investor grievance. In this regard, it is noted that being a listed company, the Noticee was obligated to comply with the directions of SEBI in respect of obtaining SCORES Authentication and also redressal of investor complaints. Further, vide SEBI letter having reference no. PLO/AK/OW/4454/2014 dated February 10, 2014, Noticee was advised to obtain SCORES authentication and to redress all pending  investor grievances latest by February 20, 2014 and submit Action ATR in SCORES, failing which SEBI would be constrained to initiate appropriate enforcement actions as per SEBI Act, 1992.  d) From the above, I find that despite repeated reminders by SEBI through various circulars as well as through letter in the matter, the Noticee did not pay heed to the same. Further, I note that Noticee failed to furnish any reply to the SCN and also did not avail the opportunities of personal hearing. In this regard, I would like to refer to the order of Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in the matter of Classic Credit Ltd. vs. SEBI, (Appeal No. 68/2003, order dated December 08, 2006), wherein it, inter-alia, held \\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201cthe appellants did not file any reply to the second show-cause notice. This being so, it has to be presumed that the charges alleged against them in the show-cause notice were admitted by them\\\\\\\\u201d. Similarly, I would like to quote the Adjudication Order in respect of Ambuja Electro Castings Limited for failure to obtain SCORES Authentication and for failure to redress investor grievances                                                Page 6 of 9  Order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Others vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 68 of 2013, order dated February 11, 2014), has also inter alia, observed that: \\\\\\\\u201c...As rightly contended by Mr. Rustomjee, learned senior counsel for respondents, appellants have neither filed Adjudication Order in respect of Ravraj Impex Ltd. in the matter of Non-obtaining of SCORES authentication reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted charges leveled against them in the show cause notices...\\\\\\\\u201d.  e) I note that it was obligatory on the part of the Noticee to obtain SCORES authentication and also to redress investor complaints within the time frame stipulated by SEBI. However, from the facts available on record, it was observed that the Noticee had consistently failed and neglected to comply with the afore-mentioned SEBI Circulars. In this context, I would also like to refer to the judgment of the Hon'ble SAT in S. S. Forgings & Engineering Limited & Others v SEBI, (Appeal No. 176 of 2014 decided on August 28, 2014) wherein it, inter alia, observed that \\\\\\\\u201c.....This Tribunal has consistently held that redressal of investors\\\\\\\\u2019 grievances is extremely important for the Regulator to regulate the capital market. If the grievances are not redressed within a time bound framework, it leads to frustration among the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 who may not be motivated to further invest in the capital market. Hence, the importance of complaints redressal system initiated by SEBI in June, 2011 cannot be undermined and its sanctity has to be maintained by all the listed companies.....\\\\\\\\u201d.   f) In view of the above facts, I conclude that the allegation of non-obtaining of SCORES Authentication and failure to redress investor grievances in stipulated time stand established against the Noticee and therefore, the Noticee has violated SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s Circulars No. CIR/OIAE/2/2011 dated June 3, 2011, CIR/OIAE/1/2012 dated August 13, 2012, CIR/OIAE/1/2013 dated April 17, 2013 and CIR/OIAE/1/2014 dated December 18, 2014. Adjudication Order in respect of Ambuja Electro Castings Limited for failure to obtain SCORES Authentication and for failure to redress investor grievances                                                Page 7 of 9  Issue (b): If yes, whether the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under sections 15C and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992?  a) It has been established in the foregoing paragraphs that Noticee has violated the provisions of aforementioned SEBI Circulars. I would like to quote the Order of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Port Shipping Company Ltd. vs SEBI decided on 29.04.2015 wherein it was observed that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026As held by this Tribunal in case of M/s. Vidarbha Industries Ltd. (supra) and Rakan Steels (supra) where a listed company fails to obtain SCORES authentication within the time stipulated by SEBI, then it amounts to violating the directions of SEBI and in such a case penalty is imposable under Section 15HB of SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  b) Therefore, after taking into account the aforesaid entire facts / circumstance of the case and the aforesaid case law, I note that the said violations of provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and SEBI Circulars by the Noticee attracts the imposition of monetary penalties upon the Noticee under sections 15C and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992. The text of the said sections are reproduced below: The SEBI Act, 1992 Penalty for failure to redress investors\\\\\\\\u2019 grievances.  15C. If any listed company or any person who is registered as an intermediary, after having been called upon by the Board in writing, to redress the grievances of investors, fails to redress such grievances within the time specified by the Board, such company or intermediary shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees.  15HB. Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided: Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or the regulations made or directions issued by the Board thereunder for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but may extend to one crore rupees. Adjudication Order in respect of Ambuja Electro Castings Limited for failure to obtain SCORES Authentication and for failure to redress investor grievances                                                Page 8 of 9  Issue (c): If yes, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed duly taking into account the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992?  a) While determining the quantum of penalty under sections 15C and 15HB  of the SEBI Act,1992,  it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992 r/w rule 5(2) of the Adjudication Rules, 1995 which reads as under:-  The SEBI Act, 1992 Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer 15J -: While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:-  (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever  quantifiable, made as a result of the default;  (b)  the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default;  (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  b) The  material    available    on    record    has    not    quantified    the    amount    of  disproportionate  gain  or  unfair  advantage,  if  any,  made  by  the  Noticee  and  the loss, if any, suffered by the investors as a result of the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s failure. I note that the Noticee by failing to comply with the direction of obtaining SCORES authentication and to redress investor grievances has repeatedly violated the directions given by SEBI through SEBI Circulars.        ORDER  8. In view of the above, after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and the factors mentioned in the provisions of section 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 r/w rule 5 of Adjudication Rules, 1995, I hereby impose a penalty of Rs 1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) on the Noticee i.e. Ambuja Electro Castings Limited in terms of the provisions of sections 15C and 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992. I am of the view that the said penalty is commensurate with the default committed by the Noticee. Adjudication Order in respect of Ambuja Electro Castings Limited for failure to obtain SCORES Authentication and for failure to redress investor grievances                                                Page 9 of 9  9. The Noticee shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order through Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI -Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, or the online payment facility available on the website of SEBI, i.e., www.sebi.gov.in on the following path, by clicking on the payment link: ENFORCEMENT -> Orders -> Orders of AO -> PAY NOW. In case of any difficulties in payment of penalties, Noticee may contact the support at portalhelp@sebi.gov.in.   10. The Noticee shall forward the said Demand Draft or the details/confirmation of penalty so paid to the Enforcement Department of SEBI. Noticee shall provide the following details while forwarding DD/payment information: a) Name and PAN of the entity (Noticee) b) Name of the case / matter c) Purpose of Payment \\\\\\\\u2013Payment of penalty under AO proceedings d) Bank Name and Account Number  e) Transaction Number  11. In terms of the provision of rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, 1995, a copy of this order is being sent to the Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Mumbai.

SETTLEMENT ORDER (Application No. 4252/2020) On the application submitted by Interglobe Aviation Limited   (PAN: AABCI2726B)  Settlement Order No: Order/GR/KG/2020-21/6365 1. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) had received several complaints from Mr. Rakesh Gangwal (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cComplainant\\\\\\\\u201d), co-founder and director of Interglobe Aviations Limited (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d). The complaints have alleged several violations inter alia regarding the following:  a. compliance of corporate governance norms by the Noticee; b. related party transactions (\\\\\\\\u201cRPTs\\\\\\\\u201d) between the Noticee and the \\\\\\\\u2018IGE Group\\\\\\\\u2019 (consisting of Mr. Rahul Bhatia, co-founder of the Noticee, along with his affiliates, holding approximately 38% shareholding in the Noticee); c. timely intimation of important information to the board of directors of the Noticee; d. misrepresentation made by the Noticee in its Red Herring Prospectus dated October 16, 2015e. the failure of the Noticee in making timely disclosure of material information which was likely to have significant market reaction, in contravention of Regulation 30(4)(i)(b) of the LODR Regulations, text of which is reproduced herein below: (4)  (i)  The  listed  entity  shall  consider  the  following  criteria  for  determination  of materiality of events/ information:  (a) *****  (b) the  omission  of  an  event  or  information  is  likely  to  result  in  significant market reaction if the said omission came to light at a later date 2. The Competent Authority has, vide order dated May 5, 2020, appointed the undersigned as the Adjudicating Officer (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cAO\\\\\\\\u201d) under section 15I(1) read with section 19 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 and Rule 3 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cRules\\\\\\\\u201d) to enquire into and adjudge under section 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 for the alleged violations by the Noticee.  3. Pursuant to the aforesaid complaints received from the complainant, SEBI had examined the issues raised in the said complaints. Based on the investigation conducted by SEBI, a notice to show cause dated November 10, 2020 was issued with respect to the Noticee, inter alia containing the following allegations:a. At the request of its Chairman, the Noticee had engaged Ernst & Young (\\\\\\\\u201cEY\\\\\\\\u201d) to conduct a review of the ongoing RPTs of the Noticee for past five years, in the first phase of review. Except for the Chairman of the Noticee, no other board member, including the Audit Committee, had access to the report submitted by EY (\\\\\\\\u201cEY Report\\\\\\\\u201d). The findings of the EY report was communicated to the board members by the Chairman in the board meeting dated March 4, 2019. The EY Report inter alia contained important information regarding an independent analysis of the RPTs undertaken by the Noticee. Such information was necessary for the board of directors in order to fulfill their responsibilities. The Noticee should have made the report available to the directors at the board meeting. Further, the Noticee should have provided the report to the complainant, when he requested for the same in his later emails to the Noticee. In any case, all directors, including the complainant should have been privy to such information in order to fulfill their responsibilities as directors under Regulation 4(2)(f)(iii)(13) of LODR Regulations. By not sharing such a critical information the Noticee had allegedly failed to consider the interest of the stakeholders as stipulated in Regulation 4(1)(h) of LODR Regulations. Prima facie, this was in violation of Regulations 4(1)(h) and 4(2)(f)(iii)(13) of LODR Regulations.  b. On May 22, 2019, the complainant along with his related entities had submitted to the Board of the Noticee a requisition under Section 100 of the Companies Act, 2013 to convene an EGM, asking the shareholders to pass a resolution directing the directors and senior management of the Company to strictly adhere to the Code, and recommending certain new protocols that will reinforce and underscorethe Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s resolve towards good governance and transparency as well as protect the interests of all its shareholders and stakeholders. In the board meeting on June 12, 2019, the Board of the Noticee however voted to not proceed with the EGM requisition on the basis of a legal opinion dated June 7, 2019 obtained by the Company from a former Judge of the Supreme Court of India opining that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026the Board need not call an extraordinary general meeting of the Querist\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d However, the said legal opinion was allegedly shared only six minutes before the scheduled start of the board meeting via an email from the Company Secretary inter alia to the complainant with a copy to the Chairman of the Noticee. Further, the board did not take a break in the meeting to read the full legal opinion. In this regard Standard 1.3.7 under \\\\\\\\u201cSecretarial Standard-1\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u2013 Secretarial Standard on Meetings of the board of directors (which is mandatory as per Section 118(10) of the Companies Act) specifically stipulates that the agenda of the meeting and notes on the agenda shall be given to the directors at least seven days before the board meeting. On the other hand, Regulation 4(2)(f)(iii)(13) of LODR Regulations, prescribes timely access to information to the members of the board of directors in order to fulfill their responsibilities.  The legal opinion was received by the Company on June 7, 2019. However, it was shared with the board members six minutes before the board meeting on June 12, 2019.The legal opinion prima facie formed part of the important matter to be discussed in the board meeting; sharing it merely six minutes before the start of the meeting cannot be construed as \\\\\\\\u2018timely\\\\\\\\u2019. The legal opinion was the basis on which the requisition of the EGM was rejected and hence it had allegedlyundermined the interest of the stakeholders as stipulated in Regulation 4(1)(h) of LODR Regulations. Prima facie, this conduct of the Noticee was in violation of Regulations 4(1)(h) and 4(2)(f)(iii)(13)of LODR Regulations. c. At the time of its Initial Public Offering (\\\\\\\\u201cIPO\\\\\\\\u201d) of shares, the Noticee in its Red Herring Prospectus dated October 16, 2015 (\\\\\\\\u201cRHP\\\\\\\\u201d) disclosed to the investors that, except the rights related to the board nomination and control, other rights mentioned in the shareholders\\\\\\\\u2019 agreement dated April 23, 2015, between the two promoter groups and the Noticee (\\\\\\\\u201cSHA\\\\\\\\u201d), including rights related to transfer of equity shares (right to first refusal and tag along rights) and acquisition of equity shares (\\\\\\\\u201ctransfer and acquisition rights\\\\\\\\u201d), will terminate. The transfer and acquisition rights expired from the SHA on November 10, 2019 (four years post IPO) and hence as per the disclosures made in the prospectus, should not be exercisable by the two promoter groups. The period of four years post the issue ended on November 10, 2019. On November 13, 2019, the complainant, who was a promoter and director of the Noticee, along with his affiliates, requisitioned an EGM for removal of certain rights related to transfer of equity shares and acquisition of equity shares from the Articles. The EGM was held on January 29, 2020 wherein the shareholders rejected the proposal to amend the Articles. The Noticee, by failing to remove these rights from the Articles, had allegedly not complied with the statement made in its prospectus and had thus misrepresented facts before its shareholders. This conduct of the Noticee was prima facie considered to be in violation of Regulations 4(1)(c) and 4(1)(h) of LODR Regulations.d. At the AGM of the Noticee held on September 21, 2016, the resolution passed was for alteration in the Articles of Association by deleting Part II from the existing Articles and there was no specific mention of approval of Part I of the Articles, which inter alia contained the rights of the IGE Group related to nomination of directors / Chairman and certain KMPs. Shareholder approval, post IPO, was not taken for inclusion of the said rights related to nomination of directors / Chairman and certain KMPs in its Articles, thereby allegedly violating Regulation 4(2)(c) of LODR Regulations.  e. Several counts of violations of the Regulation 23(2) of the LODR Regulations pertaining to Related Party Transactions was alleged, which are detailed herein under:  i. Lease agreement dated July 19, 2016 with Pegasus Buildtech Private Limited was entered into by the Company before seeking prior approval of the Audit Committee. ii. Various sub-leasing agreements in 2017 and 2018 with Interglobe Air Transport Limited (\\\\\\\\u201cIGAT\\\\\\\\u201d) were entered into by the Company before seeking prior approval of the Audit Committee. iii. Approval of the Audit Committee was not taken for renewed General Services Agency (GSA) agreement dated June 7, 2016 iv. Crew Accommodation contract dated January 5, 2016 with Caddie Hotels Private Limited for which post facto approval of the audit committee wasobtained on January 21, 2016. Since this contract was entered into before seeking prior approval of the Audit Committee, it is in violation of Regulation 23(2) of LODR Regulations. v. Crew Accommodation contract dated December 12, 2017, with Caddie Hotels Private Limited was entered on. It is noted that the omnibus approval by the Audit Committee in its meeting dated May 9, 2017 approved a maximum permissible amount of INR 5,720/-. However, the rate of this agreement includes INR 7,000 for single occupancy accommodation which is higher than the approved amount in the omnibus approval. Hence, it is alleged that the aforesaid omnibus approval is not applicable in this case. The agreement was entered into allegedly without taking approval of the Audit Committee and hence it was allegedly in violation of Regulation 23(2) of LODR Regulations. f. For renewal of the Crew Accommodation contract on March 20, 2018 with Caddie Hotels Private Limited, the authorization provided under the omnibus approval provided in the Audit Committee meeting held on May 9, 2017, was relied upon. However, the contract was allegedly not placed subsequently in the audit committee meeting for review. It was therefore alleged that the Noticee has accepted that the agreement was not placed before the Audit Committee for review which was purportedly in violation of Regulation 23(3)(d) of LODR Regulations. g. The announcement dated July 9, 2019 by the Noticee contained complaint dated July 8, 2019 by Mr. Rakesh Gangwal to SEBI along with various previous lettersby IGE Group to the board on the matters related to the complaints raised by Mr. Gangwal, including non-requisition of EGM and review of RPTs between IndiGo and the IGE Group. The announcement dated July 9, 2019, containing the said previous letters, led to significant market reaction, as indicated by NSE, and hence it had allegedly triggered the Regulation 30(4)(i)(b) on account of non-disclosure of these letters at the time of their receipt by the Company. In view of the above, it was alleged that the Noticee was in violation of Regulation 30(4)(i)(b) of LODR Regulations.   4. Pending Adjudication Proceedings, the Noticee (applicant) proposed to settle the instant proceedings initiated against it, without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusions of law, through a settlement order and filed a settlement application with SEBI bearing reference number 4252 / 2020 dated December 23, 2020, in terms of the provisions of SEBI (Settlement Proceedings) Regulations, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as \"Settlement Regulations\"). 5.

Risk Profiling:   7.1. Risk profiling and Non-communication of risk profile to clients: 7.1.1. As per Regulation 16 (a) and 16(b) of IA Regulation, IA is required to obtain information about the client which includes age, investment objective, income details, existing investments, risk appetite, liabilities, etc. for the purpose of determination and quantification of risk appetite of the client.  As per clause 4 of code of conduct read with Regulations 15(9) of IA Regulations, IA is required to seek information from its clients about their financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives before providing them investment advice / services. As per Regulation 16(e) of IA Regulations, the IA is under obligation to communicate the risk profile of the client after risk assessment is done. 7.1.2. It is noted that Capitalaim has a Risk Profiling Questionnaire with 15 questions for determining risk assessment of the clients. Corresponding to each question, a set of answers has been stated. Each answer has been assigned a particular weightage. Depending on the response of the client, the total score of the client is calculated. The maximum total score is 40. Based on the response of the clients, assigned scores are given and risk appetite of the clients are assessed. Depending on the score, Capitalaim classifies the clients into following Risk Categories  Risk profiling questionnaire score Risk category of client 0 \\\\\\\\u2013 15 Low 16 \\\\\\\\u2013 25 Medium 26 \\\\\\\\u2013 40 High   7.1.3. During the inspection, with regard to the communication of risk profile to 52 clients, it is observed that for 27 clients (more than 50% of sample size), Capitalaim did not __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Capitalaim Financial Advisory Private Limited                                                                                       Page 8 of 34 communicate the risk profile to them before selling a product / collecting fees for the product i.e. emails sent to them by IA did not have the attachment of risk profile. Further, it is to be noted that any confirmation / reply email received by the Capitalaim, from said 27 clients in regard to the emails which did not had any attachment, would not amount to any communication of risk profile to said 27 clients.  7.1.4. Thus, it is prima facie observed in respect of these 27 clients, there is no evidence of communicating the risk profile to them before selling a product / collecting fees for the product. Thus, these 27 client has no means to know whether the Risk Profile correctly reflects their risk assessment as the risk profile is not communicated before selling a product / collecting fees for the product. 7.1.5. Therefore, it is prima facie found that from the 52 sample clients, Capitalaim has not communicated risk profile for 27 clients before selling a product / collecting fees for the product. 7.1.6. Thus, from the above it is prima facie found that Capitalaim has not communicated risk profile to the clients before selling a product / collecting fees for the product and the clients has no means to know whether the Risk Profile arrived pursuant to the risk assessment by Capitalaim correctly reflects the risk assessment of the client. Thereby, Capitalaim has not acted with honesty, fairness and in the best interest of its clients and by not communicating / disclosing the risk profiling to the clients, Capitalaim has not made the adequate disclosures of relevant material information while dealing with its clients to its clients. In view of the same, Capitalaim has prima facie (a) failed to communicate risk profile to the clients in accordance with Regulation 16(e) of IA Regulations; and (b) failed to abide by clauses 1 and 5 of Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Capitalaim has prima facie violated the provision of Regulation 16(e) and clauses 1 and 5 of Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations.   7.2. Products meant for High Risk Bearing Clients Sold to Medium Risk Bearing clients: 7.2.1.  As per Regulation 17 of IA Regulations, the IA shall ensure that all investments on which investment advice is provided is appropriate to the risk profile of the client; the IA should have documented process for selecting investments for its clients based on __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Capitalaim Financial Advisory Private Limited                                                                                       Page 9 of 34 their investment objective and financial situation; IA should understand the nature and risks of products or assets selected for clients; IA shall have reasonable basis for believing that a recommendation meets client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment objective, the client is able to bear any related investment risks consistent with its investment objectives and risk tolerance and the  client  has  the  necessary  experience  and knowledge  to understand the risks involved in the transaction; and the IA has to ensure that a recommendation given to client is based on reasonable assessment that the risk reward profile of financial product is consistent with client\\\\\\\\u2019s experience, knowledge, investment objective, risk appetite and capacity for absorbing loss.  7.2.2.

From the risk profile form of the aforesaid clients, it is observed that, despite these clients have been categorized as \\\\\\\\u2018Medium Risk\\\\\\\\u2019 by Capitalaim itself, the IA has sold products meant for \\\\\\\\u2018High Risk\\\\\\\\u2019 clients. It is noted that as per Regulation 17 of IA Regulation, \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Adviser shall ensure that all investments on which investment advice is provided is appropriate to the risk profile of the client\\\\\\\\u201d i.e. IA is not allowed to offer high risk products to clients falling in medium risk category. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Capitalaim Financial Advisory Private Limited                                                                                       Page 11 of 34 7.2.5. From the above, it is prima facie found that Capitalaim has sold products/services falling under its \\\\\\\\u2018High Risk Category\\\\\\\\u2019 to the clients falling under \\\\\\\\u2018Medium Risk Category\\\\\\\\u2019 and has not acted with due skill, care, diligence, honesty and in the best interest of its clients while selling products/services to its clients. In view of the same, Capitalaim has prima facie (a) failed to provide the investment advice as per the risk suitability of clients in accordance with regulation 17 of IA Regulations; (b) failed in its responsibility to act in fiduciary capacity to its client which is entrusted upon it under Regulation 15(1) of IA regulation; and (c) failed to abide by clauses 1 and 2 of Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Capitalaim has prima facie violated the provision of clauses 1 and 2 of Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations; Regulation 15(1) and Regulation 17 of IA Regulations.  7.3. Advisory Services Sold prior to Risk Profiling  7.3.1. As per regulation 17 of IA Regulations, the IA has to ensure that all investments on which investment advice is provided is appropriate to the risk profile of the client. During the inspection, from the documents / information obtained with respect to 52 sample clients, it is noted that Capitalaim had received advisory fees from its clients prior to assessing and communicating the risk profiling to the clients.

Thus, it is prima facie observed that the products had already been sold by the IA and advisory fees had been charged even before the risk profiling of the client was completed as well as even before the risk profile was communicated to its clients. It appears that the same has been done by Capitalaim to earn advisory fees / profits by selling products without caring for the needs of the clients. 7.3.5.Therefore, from the above it is prima facie found that the products sold by Capitalaim to its client\\\\\\\\u2019s could be completely inappropriate to the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 need, as the risk profiling has not been completed for the client before selling the product. Thereby, IA has not acted with honesty and in the best interest of its clients while providing investment advice appropriate to the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 risk profile. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Capitalaim Financial Advisory Private Limited                                                                                       Page 14 of 34 7.3.6.In view of the same, Capitalaim has prima facie (a) failed to provide the investment advice appropriate to the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 risk profile in accordance with regulation 17(a) of IA Regulations; and (b) failed to abide by clause 1of Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Capitalaim has prima facie violated the provisions of Regulation 17(a) and clause 1, of Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations.  8. Unreasonable / Unfair Fees Charged from Clients:  8.1. As per clause 6 of code of conduct specified in third Schedule of IA Regulations, an investment adviser, advising a client may charge fair and reasonable fees, subject to any ceiling as may be specified by the Board, if any. I note that the examination has prima facie found the following instances of collection of unreasonable / unfair fee. The said instances relates to:   8.1.1. Unreasonable fee / disproportionate fees to the annual income/proposed investment; 8.1.2. Locking in the clients by advance fee for sale of products without refund; 8.1.3. Arbitrary and unreasonable fee from the same client for the same service; 8.1.4. Arbitrary and unreasonable fee from different clients for the same service;     8.2. Unreasonable fee / disproportionate fees to the annual income/proposed investment:   8.2.1.

Thus, form the above table, it is prima facie found that out of 52 sample clients, from 18 clients, Capitalaim has charged fees which are disproportionate to the annual income and / or proposed investment.   8.2.3.  In order to determine the \\\\\\\\u201creasonableness\\\\\\\\u201d of the fee charged by the Investment Adviser, I note that while no fixed standard can be devised to term whether the conduct of charging fee answers the test of reasonableness, it cannot also be stated that the __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Capitalaim Financial Advisory Private Limited                                                                                       Page 16 of 34 reasonableness of the fee charged cannot be judged at all.

Such assignment and charge shall be a continuing security for the due and punctual payment and discharge of the secured obligations. Upon payment of all or part of the amounts due under the Loan Agreement, SOMA may withdraw from the Account the equivalent amount. Upon payment and final discharge in full of all the secured obligations, this agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties shall automatically cease and terminate and the Bank shall, at the request of SOMA, release the deposit made in the Account. SOMA covenants with the Bank that it will on demand pay and discharge the secured obligations when due to the bank. At any time after the bank shall have demanded payment of all or any of the Secured Obligations the Bank may without further notice apply all or any part of the Deposit against the Secured Obligations in such order as the bank in it\\\\\\\\u2019s discretion determine.   SOMA  hereby irrevocably appoints by way of security the Bank as the attorney of SOMA  with full power in the name and on behalf of SOMA to sign, seal and deliver any deed, assurance, instrument or act in order to perfect this charge and at any time after an event of default by SOMA to sign, seal and deliver any deed assurance, instrument or act which may be required for the purpose of exercising fully and effectively all or any of the powers hereby conferred to the Bank to take all necessary action whether in the nature of legal proceedings or otherwise to recover any moneys which may be held in the Account and to give valid receipts for payment of such moneys and also for the purpose of enforcement and  of the security hereby created.

Attention: Mr. Sunil Patel\\\\\\\\u201d                     Final Order in the matter of Soma Textiles & Industries Limited  Page 5 of 76  c) The aforesaid charge against designated bank account of SOMA with Banco was registered with Companies House (United Kingdom's registrar of companies) and description of the charge is mentioned as follows:  - \\\\\\\\u201cAll obligations of Whiteview Trading Corporation (a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with number 683351) under a loan agreement with the Bank dated 18 October 2016 (the secured Obligations).   The Company as a continuing security for the discharge of the Secured Obligations with full title guarantee assigns to and charge by way of first fixed charge in favour of the Bank and all its right, title and interest in and to its designated account with the Bank (the Account), the moneys standing to the credit of the Account and all interest payable thereon (the Deposit).  The Company undertakes that it will not purport to withdraw the Deposit or any part of it or sell, assign, mortgage, charge or otherwise encumber, dispose or deal with or grant or permit third party rights to arise over or against the Deposit or any part thereof or attempt or agree so to do.\\\\\\\\u201d  d) The account charge agreement dated October 18, 2006 was an integral part of loan agreement dated October 18, 2006 entered into between Whiteview and Banco. These agreements enabled Whiteview to avail a loan from Banco for subscribing GDRs of Noticee no. 1. However, the fraudulent arrangement of loan agreement and account charge agreement which resulted in subscription of GDR issue of the company was not disclosed to the stock exchange  e) The GDR issue would not have been subscribed had the company not given any such security towards the loan taken by the Whiteview.  f) From perusal of corporate announcements, it was found that Noticee no. 1 had not informed stock exchange with regard to account charge agreement entered into with Banco for subscription of GDRs and the outcomes of the board meetings dated July 27, 2006 which were price sensitive information and could have impacted the price of the scrip.  g) From the extracts of minutes of board meeting held on July 27, 2006, investigation observed that Mr. Sunil Patel (Noticee no. 7) was authorized to sign the account charge agreement which acted as security in connection with the loan availed by Whiteview and Banco to use funds deposited in Noticee no. 1\\\\\\\\u2019s bank account as security in connection with the loan availed by Whiteview. Relevant extracts of the resolution                     Final Order in the matter of Soma Textiles & Industries Limited  Page 6 of 76  passed in the aforesaid meeting of the Board of SOMA are as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cRESOLVED THAT a bank account to be opened with Banco Efisa, S.A. (\\\\\\\\u201cthe Bank\\\\\\\\u201d) or any branch of Banco Efisa S.A., including the off-shore branch (\\\\\\\\u201cthe bank\\\\\\\\u201d), outside India for the purpose of receiving the subscription money in respect of Global Depository Receipt issue of the company. \\\\\\\\u201cRESOLVED FURTHER THAT Mr. Sunil Patel, Oversesas Sales Representative of the Company and Authorised Person be and is hereby authorised to sign, execute, any application, agreement, escrow agreement, document, undertaking, confirmation, declaration and other paper(s) from time to time as may be required by the Bank and to carry and affix common seal of the company thereon, if and when so required.\\\\\\\\u201d    \\\\\\\\u201cRESOLVED FURTHER THAT Mr. Sunil Patel, Oversesas Sales Representative of the Company and Authorised Person be and is hereby authorized to draw cheques and other documents, and to give instructions from time to time as may be necessary to the said Banco Efisa, S.A. or any branch of Banco Efisa S.A. including off-shore branch, for the purpose of operation of and dealing with the said bank account and carry out other either relevant and necessary transactions and generally to take all such steps and to do all such things as may be required from time to time on behalf of this company.\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\u201cRESOLVED FURTHER THAT the Bank be and is hereby authorized to use the funds so deposited in the aforesaid bank account as security in connection with loans for which any charge is granted as well as to enter into any escrow agreement or similar agreements if and when so required.\\\\\\\\u201d  h) The company reported to the stock exchange that \\\\\\\\u201cthe Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on October 20, 2006, has approved the issue and allotment of 1,850,000 Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) worth USD 17.2975 million representing 18,500,000 underlying Equity shares of Rs 10/- each to the Depository - Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas\\\\\\\\u201d However, it did not inform stock exchange about the account charge agreement entered into between Noticee no. 1 and Banco. Information regarding signing of account charge Agreement is material information of contingent liability to the extent of GDR issues. Suppression of such material information shows that the corporate announcement was primarily meant to mislead Indian retail investors that GDRs were fully subscribed, whereas the GDR issue was indirectly funded by Noticee no. 1 itself.   i) The corporate announcement made by the company to BSE reported misleading news which contained information in a distorted manner and might have influenced decision of investors.  j) Directors of SOMA, namely, Mr. S. K. Somany (Noticee No. 3), Mr. A.K. Somany (Noticee No. 4), Mr. Prafull Anubhai (Noticee No. 5) and Mr. P. Bandopadhyay (Noticee                     Final Order in the matter of Soma Textiles & Industries Limited  Page 7 of 76  No. 6) who attended the board meeting dated July 27, 2006 and authorized the company\\\\\\\\u2019s authorized person to sign the agreement, acted as party to the fraudulent scheme.   k) Whiteview had defaulted in repayment of loan to Banco to the extent of US $ 15.67 million and loan amount of US $ 15.67 million of Whiteview was repaid by Noticee no. 1 from its GDR proceeds. Considering the fact that Whiteview was the sole subscriber to the GDR issue and loan amount of US $ 15.67 million of Whiteview was repaid by Noticee no. 1 from its GDR proceeds, it was therefore concluded that GDRs in turn the underlying equity shares to the extent of US $ 15.67 were acquired by Whiteview without proper consideration.   6. A supplementary show cause notice dated August 26, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was also issued to Noticee no. 1 calling upon it to show cause as to why suitable directions including direction to bring the money back to the extent of loan default should not be issued against it under Sections 11, 11B and 11(4) of the SEBI Act 1992.   INSPECTION, REPLY, HEARING AND WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS:  7.

Noticee no. 2 did not appear for the hearing scheduled on April 05, 2019 and did not file any letter seeking adjournment of the same. Subsequently, SSCN dated August 26, 2019 was issued to Noticee no. 1. The Noticee no. 1 then vide its letters dated September 19, 2019 sought inspection of documents.

Final Order in the matter of Soma Textiles & Industries Limited  Page 9 of 76   10. The various submissions made by the Noticees vide their aforesaid replies and submissions made during the course of the hearing, are summarised as hereunder: a) The Noticees no. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 have made similar submissions vide their respective replies. The common submissions made by Noticees nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 vide their aforesaid replies and submissions made during the course of hearing, are summarized as hereunder:   (i) We would like to bring to your kind attention that along with the said SCN, we have also been issued SCN no. SEBI/HO/EAD-12/SM/PR/OW/1672/3/2018 January 18, 2018 under Rule 4(1) of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 [hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019] read with Section 15-I of SEBI Act, 1992 and Rule 4 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Procedure for Holding Inquiry and imposing penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 2005 read with Section 23-I of the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956. It is submitted that issuing two SCN\\\\\\\\u2019s for the same offence amounts to double jeopardy, and is in gross violation of Article 20(2) of the Constitution of India.  (ii) Without prejudice to our above submissions and without admitting any violation of SEBI Act or any Regulations whatsoever, on our part, it is humbly submitted that the concerned GDR issue was raised/undertaken by Soma in 2006 and the instant proceedings against the same were initiated in the year 2017. It is pertinent to note that the proceedings against us were initiated after an inordinate delay of almost eleven long years. It is highly unreasonable for SEBI to expect me to keep all the documents pertaining to the transaction intact after such a long time. Human memory is fragile and its nearly impossible to remember the details of a transaction after a long time gap of 11 years. Without prejudice to the above, I request that the current proceedings may be dropped on the ground that there has been inordinate delay of around 11 years in the initiation of the current proceedings. (iii) The following cases have been relied upon in regard to delay in proceedings: a. Bharat J Patel vs SEBI \\\\\\\\u2013 SAT Appeal no. 154 of 2020 dated Sept 08, 2020 b.

Adjudicating Officer, SEBI vs. Bhavesh Pabari (Civil Appeal No. 11311 of 2013) \\\\\\\\u2013 SC Order dated Feb 28, 2019  (iv) It is hereby submitted that retaining and maintaining records for such long periods is impossible and unreasonable. In view of the above, we submit that all the above observations made by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court and the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the above cases are relevant in the present proceedings initiated against the company and its directors since already more than eleven years have passed since the GDR issue of STIL, Damocles sword has been hanging over us for the last eleven years and it has really affected our morale, the electronic data maintained at our end has been effected due to the floods in Ahmedabad, due to cross border nature of transaction it has been a herculean task to collect old records etc.  (v) Legal Submissions have been made with reference to the following cases: g.

Somany) have in their respective replies dated October 05, 2020 and October 19, 2020 made similar submissions and the same are inter alia, submitted as under: (i) I (Noticee no. 3) would like to place on record that I am the Chairman of Soma since                     Final Order in the matter of Soma Textiles & Industries Limited  Page 11 of 76  April 01, 1949. I have more than seven decades experience in administration and management. My foresightedness, experience and business acumen has contributed in the progress of the Soma. I am well versed and technically well experienced in the textile industry.  (ii) I (Noticee no. 3) submit that I am the Chairman of Soma and at that point in time I was also the Chairman, however, at that point of time, I was not able to attend each and every board meeting wherein inter alia any discussion related to said GDRs was taken up. I submit that out of total four meetings held on June 09, 2006, July 26, 2006, October 20, 2006 and October 31, 2006 wherein inter alia any discussion took place on GDR issue, I was only present in the Board meeting held on July 27, 2006 and not any other meeting. (iii) The Board had, in the aforesaid three mentioned meeting, discussed important aspects of the GDR issue like \\\\\\\\u2018issue of GDRs\\\\\\\\u2019, \\\\\\\\u2018allotment of GDRs\\\\\\\\u2019 and \\\\\\\\u2018use of GDR proceeds\\\\\\\\u2019. I (Noticee no. 3) was not present in the above three meetings wherein these aspects were discussed. Hence, the serious allegation of fraudulent and unfair trade practice ought not to be levelled upon me since I was not party to the alleged fraud, if any. (iv) During the time of GDR issue, following were the Directors/key officials of the company: Sr.No Name Designation 1 Shri S. K. Somany Chairman 2 Shri. A. K. Somany Managing Director 3 Shri P. Bandyopadhyay Executive Director 4 Shri Prafull Anubhai Director 5 Shri Ashok C Gandhi Director 6 Shri Anupam Verma Nominee Director ICICI  (v) With regard to Para 2 of the SCN, in so far as the list of subscribers to GDR is concerned, it is submitted that the list of subscribers to the issue is true and correct to best of my knowledge and nothing has been concealed or suppressed by us. The list of subscribers was provided to Soma by the Lead Manager PAAL and I relied upon them which has been the practice over the years. I did not have any independent mechanism to verify the same and as per the secrecy laws applicable                     Final Order in the matter of Soma Textiles & Industries Limited  Page 12 of 76  in other jurisdictions, it was not possible for me to verify the same. The company relied upon the Merchant Banker, considering the cross border nature of transactions and registration of Merchant Banker with reputed regulatory authority. (vi) With regard to para 4 of the said SCN, I (Noticee no. 3) submit and reiterate that I was not present during the meeting and was granted leave of absence. Hence, I am unaware of the same and cannot be alleged to have violated SEBI Act and PFUTP Regulations. It was also decided during the course of one of the earlier Board meeting that a bank account would be opened with Banco for the purpose of receiving money in respect of GDR issue and Mr. Sunil Patel was authorized to sign and execute any application, agreement, escrow agreement etc. from time to time. (vii) Soma (Noticee no. 1) informed BSE about successfully concluding the placement of 18,50,000 GDRs totaling to USD 17.2975 million. Further, SEBI has rightly pointed out that same was informed to Stock Exchanges (BSE) vide corporate announcement made by Company to BSE during the same period. With regard to para 4 of the said SCN, admittedly SEBI has rightly pointed out that Board of Directors at their meeting held on October 20, 2006 approved the issue and allotment of 18,50,000 GDRs worth USD 17.29 million equivalent to 1.85 crore equity shares of Rs. 10/- each. Pursuant to that, STIL informed BSE about successfully concluding the placement of 1,850,000 GDRs at USD 9.35 each totaling to USD 17.29 million. (viii) The same relates to credit agreement entered between Whiteview Trading Corporation and Banco Efisa, SFE, SA. The credit agreement was signed between one Mr. Samuel E. Hurley on behalf of Whiteview. Further, I (Noticee no. 3) am not a signatory to the agreement. Hence, I cannot be held responsible for the same. I submit that since I am not signatory to the said credit agreement, I cannot be held liable for any averments/declaration/statements/conditions mentioned in the agreement. Hence, any liability of Whiteview and/or Banco cannot be lumbered on to me. (ix) I submit that the Board of Directors had authorized Mr. Sunil with the task of carrying out the process of GDR issue and sign any agreement pursuant to GDR issue. I, along with other directors and Mr. Sunil were sensitive of the fact that this is a cross border financial transaction and therefore SOMA appointed a Merchant Banker                     Final Order in the matter of Soma Textiles & Industries Limited  Page 13 of 76  registered with a foreign regulatory authority viz. UK-FCA to carry out said transaction.  (x) I am also now very shocked, surprised and disturbed on getting to know that GDR was subscribed by only one entity by the name of Whiteview and not by five entities as informed to SOMA by PAAL. This established that PAAL has devised the scheme, artifice etc. of a farce GDR, I have been made a scapegoat and have been wrongly accused of a fraud which I have not committed.  (xi) In so far as the allegation at para 9 and 10 that Soma had passed a resolution authorizing Banco to use the GDR proceeds as security against loan, it is submitted that it was never intention of the Board that the funds which are to be deposited to the GDR proceeds are given as security in connection with the Loan to be given for the subscription of the GDR issue itself. (xii) It is brought to your notice that the resolution only states that the proceeds so deposited in the bank account can be used as security \\\\\\\\u201cif and when so required\\\\\\\\u201d. Nowhere in the resolution, it has been specifically stated that the proceeds are pledged on account of loan availed by Whiteview to subscribe to the GDR issue. The same is reiterated for your kind perusal: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026RESOLVED FURTHER THAT the bank be and is hereby authorized to use the funds so deposited in the aforesaid bank account as security in connection with loans if any as well as to enter into any Escrow Agreement or similar arrangements if and when so required\\\\\\\\u201d. (Emphasis supplied). (xiii) Further admittedly the Board has authorized only one person Mr. Sunil Patel to carry out necessary formalities for which he relied upon the expertise and knowledge of the Lead Manager registered with UK Regulator. I submit that the SCN is misdirected towards me just for being part of the Board meeting which appointed Mr. Sunil Patel as Authorized Signatory. Further, Mr. Sunil and other directors of the company were dependent upon the Lead Manager considering their experience.  (xiv) The account charge agreement was signed between Soma and Banco which allegedly creates obligation on behalf of the company towards the bank under the loan agreement. However, the said conditions of the agreement will not get activated till the time subscription money is received in the account opened for GDR issue. The company would be able to provide security against the subscription                     Final Order in the matter of Soma Textiles & Industries Limited  Page 14 of 76  proceeds only when subscription is received and not before that. Hence the allegation that Soma has authorized Banco Bank to use the GDR proceeds as security against loan is devoid of merit and contrary to material on record. (xv) In this regard, I would like to quote the observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in Adi Cooper vs. SEBI (Appeal no. 124 of 2019, decided on November 05, 2019). The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Tribunal has observed that the Board Resolution authorizing the Bank to utilize the proceeds as security in connection with a loan cannot be inferred as loan given to Whiteview. Such presumption is farfetched and cannot hold that the appellant had intention to manipulate the market or play a fraud. Further, I was only present in one of the meetings wherein the GDR was discussed and not available in other meetings which was the case in Adi ", "Date": "2021-02-08", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Order passed by SEBI in the matter of GDR issue of Soma Textiles & Industries Limited [SAT Appeal No.:389/2021]", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/feb-2021/order-passed-by-sebi-in-the-matter-of-gdr-issue-of-soma-textiles-and-industries-limited_49053.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 59584, "unique_record_id": "b9361d85fdSEBI20210208", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6681112c7858910306471eac", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 08:02:22", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "US $15.67 million", "gpt_audience": "- Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\n- Soma Textiles & Industries Limited\n- Whiteview Trading Corporation\n- Investors and shareholders of Soma Textiles & Industries Limited\n- Legal representatives and advisors involved in the case\n- Financial analysts and market regulators\n- Corporate governance bodies\n- Compliance officers and auditors\n- Media and financial journalists\n- Academic researchers in finance and law", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

Tanveer and Sunny Gupta (collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticees\\\\\\\\u201d), had represented to the complainant that M/s Stock Indication was a SEBI registered entity, and offered their services for building a good portfolio of shares and promised good profits against the investments.

Therefore, the archive pages of the website was downloaded from the www.archive.org for the purpose of the examination.   3. On examining the archived pages of the website, it was observed that the Noticees were prima-facie engaged in providing investment advisory activities without obtaining registration from ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Stock Indication                                    Page 2 of 15           SEBI in violation of provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). 4.

Nobody appeared on behalf of M/s Stock Indication and neither was any reply received on its behalf.  Summary of the submissions made by Mohd. Tanveer Ahmed a.

As soon as the notice from SEBI was received, the partnership was wound up. c. Noticee has cooperated with the SEBI investigation at all times. d. Noticee had no intention to defraud anyone and is willing to repay money, if any, which is owed to clients.  e. Copy of the complaint was not supplied. It is requested to supply a copy of the said complaint and provide opportunity of de novo hearing. f.

It was also submitted that the Noticee had not committed any illegality and has been implicated due to the conduct of Mr. Sunny Gupta. h. Noticee submitted that M/s. Stock Indication was registered as a partnership firm on 01.06.2015 for providing services of financial advisor and accordingly partnership deed was executed between him and Sunny Gupta. The services which required legal compliances were to be undertaken only after fulfilling the requisite legal formalities as per the mutual understanding of both the partners. i. It was further alleged that Sunny Gupta was responsible for day to day affairs of the firm as is evident from the deed. The Noticee under bonafide belief proceeded with the partnership firm.  j. The said firm was also registered under the relevant provisions of the Shop and Establishment Act with the appropriate Government. The said firm also filed its income tax return after duly disclosing source of its income without any failure.  k. Website was created and domain was purchased by Sunny Gupta in his own name without taking the Noticee into confidence. Further, the said website was wrongly shown to be belonging to the firm and Sunny Gupta was the sole operator of the said website. The operation of the said website was absolutely beyond the power and control of the Noticee. l.  It is submitted that Mr. Sunny Gupta offered various packages through the said website. The modus operandi was that Sunny Gupta used to buy the research data from companies registered with SEBI as Investment Advisory or Research Analyst and then to pass on the same data to his client without any change.  m. The bank account in which money was received has also the KYC records of Mr. Sunny Gupta and no money was received in HDFC bank being operated by the Noticee.  n. That upon knowing the illegality committed by Mr. Sunny Gupta, Noticee decided to dissolve the partnership firm and eventually the said partnership firm was dissolved vide Dissolution Deed dated 07.08.2018. ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Stock Indication                                    Page 6 of 15           o. Sunny Gupta started to distance himself from the present controversy and never cooperated with the Noticee owing to which he was not able to dig out things with precision leading to the present case. However, even with limited access to data of the firm, Noticee vide email dated 25.10.2018 replied to the said letter dated 02.08.2018 and submitted requisite documents as requisitioned by the Board.  p. Most of the data and document pertaining to the functioning of the firm are in the possession of Sunny Gupta who has illegally withheld the same. q. That mere use of nomenclature \\\\\\\\u2018market research agency service and recognized stock exchange service in relation to transaction in securities\\\\\\\\u2019 in Form ST-2 does not per se make the Noticee or stock indication liable under the SEBI Act. r. That every operation of the firm has been shut down.  s. It was also submitted that the Noticee undertakes not to reopen the operation of the said concern without obtaining requisite certificate from the Board. All advertisements, publications, brochures, documents etc, related to the activities of the said firm has already been removed and that the website is also not in operation.  8. Summary of the submissions made by Sunny Gupta a. Noticee was not aware that the activities being carried on by the partnership firm- Stock Indication, was a regulated activity and a certificate of registration from SEBI was required to carry on such activities. b. As soon as the notice from the SEBI was received, the partnership was wound up. c. Noticee has cooperated with the SEBI investigation at all times. d. Noticee had no intention to defraud anyone and is willing to repay money, if any, which is owed to clients.  e. The Noticee also submitted a copy of both the partnership deed and dissolution deed of M/s Stock Indication. ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Stock Indication                                    Page 7 of 15           CONSIDERATION  9. I have considered the SCN issued to the Noticee, the replies filed and other material available on record. The issue for consideration in these proceedings is whether the Noticees  have  acted  as  unregistered  investment  advisers  in  violation  of  the SEBI Act,1992 and the  IA Regulations. 10. Before moving forward, it will be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of the SEBI Act and the IA regulations which came into force w.e.f January 21, 2013. SEBI Act, 1992 \\\\\\\\u201cRegistration  of  stock  brokers,  sub-brokers,  share  transfer  agents,  etc.    12 (1)  No  stock broker,  sub-broker,  share transfer  agent, banker  to  an issue, trustee of trust  deed, registrar  to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager,  investment adviser  and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or  deal in securities except  under,  and  in  accordance  with,  the  conditions  of  a  certificate  of  registration  obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:  \\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d IA Regulations \\\\\\\\u201cApplication for grant of certificate. 3.

I note that the present proceedings emanate from a complaint received by SEBI stating that the Noticees are representing themselves as a SEBI registered entity, and are offering advisory services related to investments in the securities markets. It was alleged in the Complaint that the Complainant had paid Rs. 2.05 lakhs to the Noticees in five transactions between the period May 28, 2018 to June 18, 2018: two payments were made directly to Stock Indication\\\\\\\\u2019s ICICI Bank account no. 029705500344 and three payments were made through the online payment gateway provided on Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s website -\\\\\\\\u2018PayU India Payments Pvt. Ltd (\\\\\\\\u201c PayU money\\\\\\\\u201d). 12. I note from the records that SEBI had  examined the archival record of the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s website accessed from www.archive.org, and it was observed that the following claims were made on the website,- a) Stock Indication is an investment advisory company which provides recommendations for stocks-cash and F&O trading in NSE and BSE, commodities including bullion and metals trading in MCX and NCDEX.  b) They provide recommendations LIVE through call. c) Stock Indication team consists of highly qualified analysts who are skilled and impeccable in their analysis. These analysts, using their experience and latest software tools, are able to predict the movements in share market on time and with high accuracy. As a result, using their tip, their clients gain the most out of the share market.  d) Their services include Nifty future tips, Equity tips, Commodity tips, Agro commodity tips including equity, (cash delivery, cash intraday etc.), derivatives, (stock futures, stock options etc.) commodity (bullions, base metals, energy, oil seeds, pulses, spices etc.) e) Various packages were being offered for subscription at specified rates and for specific products. One such illustration is reproduced below: ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Stock Indication                                    Page 9 of 15           NIFTY Rs. 29,900/ yearly +18-20 calls/month +Above 80% accuracy +1 target, 1 SL f) The payment to subscribe to the services of Stock Indication can be made through PayUmoney. 13. It is noted form the records that PayU money has furnished the details of payments processed for www.stockindication.com for the period April 30, 2016 to August 1,  2018. As per the said information, ICICI Bank a/c no. 029705004279 was the linked bank account for receiving payments from PayU money and Rs. 1,00,78,937.10/ - was credited to the said linked bank account during this period from 889 transactions.  14. It is also noted that Stock Indication had two current accounts with ICICI Bank - 029705004279 and 029705500344 - and they have received credits aggregating to Rs. 1,02,57,556.68/- during the period August 30, 2017 to July 23, 2018 and Rs. 1,06,44,846.08/- during the period January 4, 2016 to July 17, 2018, respectively.

Tabular depiction of money credited into the various bank accounts held by Stock Indication (both directly and through PayU money) is as under: ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Stock Indication                                    Page 10 of 15           Table 1 S.No. Name of Account Holder PayU money/Bank A/c No. Transaction Period Aggregate value of Credit transactions (`)  Stock Indication 889 PayU money transactions which has been credited into ICICI Bank a/c no. at (1) below 30/4/2016 to 01/08/2018  1,00,78,937.10 1.

I note that Noticee No. 2 and 3 had submitted vide their reply dated October 25, 2018, on similar lines, that they were providing advisory services related to share purchases and provided a list of 29 transactions for a cumulative amount of around Rs. 2.4 lakhs. I, however, note from the audited Income and Expenditure statement of M/s Stockindication for the year ended March 31, 2018, submitted by Noticee No. 2, that the reported income from commissions amounted to Rs. 55,54,629.00 for just this one financial year. It is further noted that the Noticees have failed to submit any proof relating to the source of the money credited or the nature of the transactions reflected in the 4 bank accounts mentioned in Table 1 above.  16. I note that as per the Deed of Partnership of Stock Indication, that it has been constituted with two partners - Noticee 2 and Noticee 3 \\\\\\\\u2013 to carry on the business of Financial Advisory, Market Research Agency etc. Both the partners had contributed equal amount of initial capital and the ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Stock Indication                                    Page 11 of 15           net profit of the firm was also to be divided equally between the partners in terms of the deed. Further, the authorised person as per the deed to represent on behalf of the firm before government authorities and sign leases on behalf of the firm was Noticee No. 2. 17. Noticee No. 3 during the course of the personal hearing before me had submitted that he was not aware that the investment advisory activities conducted through Noticee No. 1 was a regulated activity and required a certificate of registration from SEBI. It was further stated that the Noticees had immediately upon receipt of the notice from SEBI, dissolved the partnership and ceased carrying on investment advisory activities.  18. I further note from the submissions made on behalf of Noticee 2 vide email dated October 10, 2020, that it has been submitted that Noticee No. 3- Sunny Gupta was responsible for the day to day affairs of the firm.; the website was created and domain was purchased by Sunny Gupta in his own name without taking the Noticee into confidence. It was also submitted that the website was wrongly shown to be belonging to the firm and Sunny Gupta was the sole operator of the said website and Noticee No. 2 upon knowing the illegality committed by Sunny Gupta, decided to dissolve the partnership firm. 19. In this regard, I am constrained to hold that the submission of the Noticee No.2 that Noticee No. 3 was in charge of the day to day operations of the firm and was responsible for creating the website and indulging in investment advisory activities, is clearly an afterthought. I note that no such claim was made in the initial reply dated October 25, 2018. Further, no evidence has been presented by Noticee No. 2 to support his claims that Noticee No. 3 was in charge of the operations of the firm other than the claims made in email dated October 10, 2020. 20. It is also noted that both Noticee No.2 and 3, in their replies have stated that M/s Stockindication has been dissolved and copy of the dissolution deed dated was also submitted. In this regard, I note that it is a settled position of law that the partners remain liable for any acts done in the name of the partnership prior to its dissolution even after such dissolution of the firm. ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Stock Indication                                    Page 12 of 15           21. In view of the discussion above, appropriate action in accordance with law needs to be initiated against Noticee 2 and Noticee 3. The interim order has contemplated issuance of directions against the Noticees including prohibiting them from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities market, and to refund the amount collected from the investors/clients/partners for its existing schemes. 22. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market and in terms of Section 11 of the SEBI Act, it has been empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate.  The Investment Advisers Regulations have been formulated with the  main  objective  of regulating  such  advisory  activities  to  safeguard  the  interests  of  investors. Registration of investment advisers under the IA Regulations has been mandated so as to provide protection to investors trading in the securities market relying on the investment advices rendered by such entities. Registration ensures that a registered Investment Advisor will carry out its activities in compliance with the terms and conditions of the certificate of registration and by fulfilling the prudential norms, risk profiling measures, disclosure and other requirements mandated under the Regulations.  23.  In view of the failure of the Noticees to provide satisfactory information related to the nature of the transactions reflected in the four bank accounts mentioned above, and taking into account the packages/fees listed out for various types of services on their websites coupled with the credit entries from the Payment gateway as detailed out in preceding paragraphs, I am constrained to hold that the amounts as alleged in the Interim Order are nothing but the amounts received by the Noticees, for rendering unauthorised investment advisory services to investors in Stock Market. Accordingly, the sum total of all the transactions/ credit entries aggregating Rs. 2,53,29,855.81/- found in the bank accounts mentioned in table 1 are held to have been paid by the clients into the accounts of Noticees through different channels in lieu of investment advisory services. ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of M/s Stock Indication                                    Page 13 of 15           Order \\\\\\\\u2013 24. Therefore, I, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 19 of the SEBI Act read with sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act, hereby issue the following directions:  a.

In an order issued on February 1, the Commission directed Chiyuto, which registered as a sole proprietorship and later on as a one-person corporation (OPC), to cease and desist, under pain of contempt, from selling and/or offering securities in the form of investment contracts until it has filed and secured the necessary license.   The SEC further enjoined Chiyuto and Creative Wealth OPC from transacting business involving funds in its depository banks and from transferring, disposing, or conveying any related assets to ensure the preservation of the assets for the benefit of affected investors.   The order covers Chiyuto\\\\\\\\u2019s owner, principal, proprietor and sole stockholder-director-president Patrocenio C. Chiyuto, Jr., nominee Judy B. Pajarillo and alternate nominee Felomina L. Andrada.  The order also extends to other officers, representatives, salesmen, solicitors, agents, uplines, enablers and influencers, including Maricris Can Chiyuto, Maria Christina Chiyuto Canobida, Naneth Barruela, Aureliza Apa-Ap, Capiz Buy and Sell Anything, Kiaka Avel Cho, and Santiago City Online Market.  The SEC issued the order after finding that Chiyuto has offered investments to the public with promised returns of 100% in one day, 30 days or 45 days, depending on the outcome of the roulette, without securing a secondary license.  Under the scheme, an investor places as low as P1 to as much as P1 million. Chiyuto will then spin the roulette to select the payout schedule and issue a promissory note to the investor with the corresponding return and day when the guaranteed earnings could be claimed.   In addition, Chiyuto has offered a 5% referral commission and held raffles with brand new cars and motorcycles as prizes to attract more investors.  The scheme involves the sale and offer of securities to the public in the form of investment contracts, whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits primarily from the efforts of others, according to the SEC. Page 2 of 2 Office of the Commission Secretary S-309, 3F PICC Secretariat Building Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) Complex Pasay City 8888-8141;8818-5478  Section 8 of Republic Act No. 8799, or The Securities Regulation Code (SRC), provides that securities shall not be sold or offered for sale or distribution within the Philippines, without a registration statement duly filed with and approved by the SEC.  Chiyuto initially registered as a sole proprietorship with the Department of Trade and Industry and subsequently as an OPC with the SEC. However, it has never secured a secondary license from the Commission as issuer of securities or broker dealer nor registered any securities for public offering pursuant to the SRC.   \\\\\\\\u201cClearly, Creative Wealth OPC\\\\\\\\u2019s members were lured to invest their money not for an existing legitimate business enterprise but simply because they are guaranteed a 100% return of the same within a definite period,\\\\\\\\u201d the order read.   \\\\\\\\u201c[T]he act of Creative Wealth OPC and Chiyuto in selling/offering unregistered securities operates as a fraud to the public which, if unrestrained, will likely cause grave or irreparable injury or prejudice to the investing public.\\\\\\\\u201d  The SEC emphasized that the certificate of registration granted to Chiyuto explicitly prohibited it from soliciting, accepting, or taking investments or placements from the public, as well as issuing investment contracts, without securing a secondary license.  Accordingly, in a letter dated February 2, the SEC Enforcement and Investor Protection Department subsequently directed Chiyuto to show cause why its certificate of registration should not be revoked and no administrative sanctions should be imposed against it and its directors, officers and nominees.   The Commission warned the public against investing in Chiyuto and other entities engaged in unauthorized investment-taking activities as early as August 18, 2020 through an advisory, as well as through an investor alert posted on its official Facebook page on October 23, 2020.

The above-named Noticees by way of their letter dated January 08, 2021 have submitted their reply.  4.5.2. The Noticees have inter alia submitted that \\\\\\\\u2013  Order in the Matter of Acropetal Technologies Ltd.         Page 7 of 32   a. The SCN, which has been issued for non-payment of dividend, is without jurisdiction as the said violation is punishable under the Companies Act, 1956, and the SEBI Act, 1992 does not empower action under SEBI Act, 1992 for the violation of the Companies Act, 1956. b. The fact that penalty has been proposed in a statute, it must not be mandatorily imposed and the adjudicating authority must act judicially to determine whether penalty should be imposed at all.  c. SEBI has already initiated prosecution for non-payment of dividend before the Special Court for Economic Offences in Bangalore by way of CC No. 115/2016. d. The majority of the dividend is payable to the promoters only and dividend amount of Rs.61,64,671.20/- has already been paid and the amount due is Rs.87,00,255.60/-. e. The non-payment of dividend was not deliberate and the Company has never defaulted in payment of dividend. The non-payment of dividend for the financial year 2011-12 was due to the freezing of their bank accounts by the CBI. f. Further, the Company has huge properties in various parts of Bangalore city worth several crores. g. With respect to the production of minutes of the meeting of the AGM, it has been submitted that all documents were kept in the premises of the Company, and the same have been taken possession by Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited. Also, since the documents  Order in the Matter of Acropetal Technologies Ltd.         Page 8 of 32   pertain to the year 2010-11 and have been seized by the CBI, hence it is taking considerable time to collate the same and furnish the reply.  Noticee No. 3 (R J Kamath) and Noticee No. 4 (Dr. Mathew J Manimala) 4.5.3. The above-named Noticees by way of their replies dated January 08, 2021 have stated the following: Common Submissions a. There has been an inordinate delay in the proceedings initiated by SEBI against the above-named Noticees. The declaration of dividend for the financial year 2011-12 was done by the Company at its AGM held on 28.09.2012 and the first complaint for non-receipt of dividend was received by SEBI on 23.10.2012. SEBI issued letter dated 13.02.2013 to ATL asking to furnish information regarding declaration. However, the SCN was issued in October, 2016 after more than three years. Further to the same, the matter is still ongoing. The SCN must therefore be withdrawn on the ground of delay. b. The Noticees had seen the Audited Statement of assets and liabilities as on 31.03.2012 of ATL. As per the Audited statement ATL had Rs. 243.83 crore as the reserve and surplus and cash/ cash equivalent was Rs. 22.15 crore with ATL. In view of the Audited Statement ATL had sufficient amount available for payment of dividend at the time of declaration.  Order in the Matter of Acropetal Technologies Ltd.         Page 9 of 32   c. Invocation of provisions of SEBI Act is untenable in the present matter. The SCN is issued by SEBI by virtue of section 55A of Companies  Act, 1956 for non-compliance as required of obligations and duties as enumerated under section 205(1A) and 207 of the Companies Act, 1956. It is submitted that the alleged non-compliance by ATL was committed in the year 2012. Section 205 (1A) of Companies Act 1956 prescribes the procedure for issuance of interim dividend. Section 207 is a substantive provision providing for criminal penalties for violation of section 205 (1A). As far as default in payment of Dividend is concerned, the above section constitutes a complete code in itself. Administration of these sections does not include imposition of new penalties that are not prescribed in the Companies Act 1956. Therefore, invocation of section 11 and 11B is excessive and untenable. This position is reinforced by the fact that the section 24 of the Companies Act, 2013 expressly empowers SEBI to invoke powers under SEBI Act to take enforcement actions for violations of the provisions mentioned therein. Specific Submissions of Noticee No. 3 d. Noticee No.3 is a senior citizen (Age: 79 years), who has worked with the Canara Bank and Andhra Bank and has an impeccable track record and has never come to adverse notice of any law enforcement agency. e. Noticee No.3\\\\\\\\u2019s case was peculiar and distinct from that of the other Noticees and no specific allegation has been made against him, and the  Order in the Matter of Acropetal Technologies Ltd.         Page 10 of 32   SCN has been issued solely on the basis of him being the Director of Acropetal Technologies.  f. Noticee No.3 had joined Acropetal Technologies in the year 2010 as an Independent Non-Executive Director and continued till September 2013. He was not involved in the day to day affairs of the Company.  g. The Notice had actively performed his duty as independent director by ensuring that the issues brought in the board meetings are discussed in the interest of shareholders in a fair and transparent manner. In this respect, Noticee No.3 in the subsequent board meeting dated February 12, 2013 had expressed serious concern regarding non-payment of dividend by Acropetal Technologies. It was recorded in the minutes of the said board meeting.  h.

In this regard, the documents/information provided by the Company on SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s SCORES system while closing the complaints were perused with respect to a set of investors. The relevant details as gathered from such perusal are provided hereunder: Table-4 Sl. No. Complainant  Details 1. Ajay Jayaswal Intimation letter sent by the Company to the shareholder intimating the payment of dividend has been provided. The letter states that a dividend amount of Rs. 600 has been paid for 500 shares on May 28, 2013.  Order in the Matter of Acropetal Technologies Ltd.         Page 21 of 32   2. Nikul Vasudevbhai Patel Certificate of payment of dividend with interest issued By YES Bank Limited showing the payment of dividend along with interest of Rs. 6254.32 for 4550 shares on August 16, 2013. 3. Dilip M. Kalburgi Intimation letter sent by the Company to the shareholder intimating the payment of dividend through DD has been provided. The letter informs that a dividend amount of Rs. 5280 has been paid for 4400 shares on March 13, 2014. A copy of the DD drawn on State Bank of India in favour of the investor has also been attached. 4. Bhawna Intimation letter sent by the Company to the shareholder intimating the payment of dividend has been provided. The letter states that a payment of dividend along with interest of Rs. 10,103.13 has been made to the investor for 7350 shares on August 16, 2013. 5. Ahmed M. Abusaad Certificate of payment of dividend with interest issued by YES Bank Limited showing the payment of dividend along with interest of Rs. 18,144.39 for 13,000 shares on August 16, 2013. 6.

However, it has been informed by the Company that a total of Rs.61,64,671.20/- has already been paid and an amount of Rs.87,00,255.60/- remains due to the shareholders as dividend. Invocation of SEBI Act for Violations of Provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 5.6. A preliminary ground of objection taken by most of the Noticees is that the invocation of provisions of SEBI Act is untenable in the present matter. It has been submitted that the SCN has been issued by SEBI by virtue of section 55A of Companies Act, 1956 for non-compliance as required of obligations and duties as enumerated under section 205(1A) and 207 of the Companies Act, 1956. As far as default in payment of Dividend is concerned, the above section constitutes a complete code in itself. Administration of these sections does not include imposition of new penalties that are not prescribed in the Companies Act 1956. Also, the above Noticees have submitted that the aforesaid position is reinforced by the fact that Section 24 of the Companies Act, 2013 expressly empowers SEBI to invoke powers under SEBI Act to take enforcement actions for violations of the provisions mentioned therein.  Order in the Matter of Acropetal Technologies Ltd.         Page 23 of 32   5.7.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) conducted investigation into the trading activities of certain entities in the scrip of Urja Global Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cUGL\\\\\\\\u201d / \\\\\\\\u201cCompany\\\\\\\\u201d) for the period October 1, 2010 to March 21, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d).

APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  2. The undersigned has been appointed as Adjudicating Officer, vide Order dated May 18, 2017 under Sub-section (1) of Section 23-I of SCRA and Rule 3 of Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and  Adjudication Order in respect of Shree Sudharshan Castings Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 2 of 12  Imposing Penalties) Rules, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCR Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to inquire into and adjudge the alleged violations committed by the Noticee, under Section 23H of SCRA.   SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING 3. A Show Cause Notice (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) bearing ref. no. EAD/ADJ/PM/AA/OW/29525/2017 dated November 24, 2017 was served on the Noticee under Rule 4 of SCR Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry be not held against it in terms of Rule 4 of the SCR Adjudication Rules and penalty be not imposed under section 23H of SCRA for the violations alleged to have been committed by it.   4. The Noticee vide its letter dated June 29, 2019 submitted its reply, which is summarized hereunder:  (a) It is submitted that the shares were transferred in the normal course of business and there was no malafide intention behind the said off-market transfer of shares.  (b) It is stated that we have no relationship of ay soft with Chetan Dogra Group, save and except a business transaction for sale of shares of UGL through off-market.  (c) Pursuant to the transaction, Chetan Dogra of Chetan Dogra Group on behalf of himself and also representing Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., had agreed to make the payment on transfer of 2,20,000 shares as per agreed terms and conditions. Little did we know that it was merely a false assurance with the ulterior motive of fraudulently getting the shares transferred from us without any consideration.  (d) It is a well settled principle of the Indian Contracts Act, 1872 that a contract binds two or more parties to perform their part of the contract. Each party to the contract is obligated to carry out its part of the contract as per the agreed terms and conditions and that we performed our part of contractual obligation by transferring the shares, whereas Chetan Dogra failed to perform his part of the contract by not paying us the  Adjudication Order in respect of Shree Sudharshan Castings Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 3 of 12  money and played a deceit upon us, thereby resulting in breach of contract.  (e) It is further submitted that on account of breach of contract by Chetan Dogra, we preferred a complaint in the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Kolkata against Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., and Chetan Dogra for fraudulent transfer of shares and non-payment.  (f) It is stated that in the entire course, we have been a victim rather than a defaulter. Therefore, SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s allegation that we have done an invalid off-market transaction is baseless and fails to consider the true facts of the case.  (g) We have complied with the provisions of the SCRA by fulfilling our contractual obligation and therefore no penalty may be levied upon us.   5. In the interest of natural justice and in terms of the provisions of Rule 4(3) of SCR Adjudication Rules, the Noticee was given an opportunity of personal hearing on December 16, 2020 which was communicated vide Email dated December 9, 2020 to the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s Email ID: shreesudharshan2015@gmail.com, sent through digitally signed Email, in terms of the provisions of Rule 7(b) of the SCR Adjudication Rules. I note that the Email sent to the Noticee did not bounce. In view of Covid-19 Pandemic, the hearing was scheduled through videoconference on WebEx platform. The link for joining the hearing through videoconference on Webex platform along with the login credentials were sent to the Noticee through email on December 15, 2020. However, I note that the Noticee did not attend the hearing.   6. In view of the above, I am of the opinion that the notice of hearing was duly served on the Noticee, yet the Noticee failed to avail the opportunity of hearing. Therefore, I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been duly followed in the matter and accordingly, I am inclined to decide the matter while taking into consideration the reply furnished by the Noticee.  Adjudication Order in respect of Shree Sudharshan Castings Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 4 of 12  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES   8. I have taken into consideration the facts and material available on record. I observe that the allegation levelled against Noticee is that it had carried out transfer of shares through off-market without receipt of consideration.  After perusal  of  the material  available  on  record,  I  have  the  following  issues  for consideration, viz.,  (I) Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Section 16 of SCRA, 1956 read with SEBI Notification G.S.R 219 (E) dated March 02, 2000, Section 13 and Section 18 of SCRA, 1956 read with Section 2(i) of SCRA, 1956.  (II) Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 23H of SCRA? (III) If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 23J of SCRA? ISSUE-I: Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Section 16 of SCRA, 1956 read with SEBI Notification G.S.R 219 (E) dated March 02, 2000, Section 13 and Section 18 of SCRA, 1956 read with Section 2(i) of SCRA, 1956.  9. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of SCRA and SEBI Notification dated March 2, 2000, which reads as under:  Section 2 (i) of SCRA In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,\\\\\\\\u2014 spot delivery contract\\\\\\\\u201d means a contract which provides for,-  (a) actual delivery of securities and the payment of a price therefor either on the same day as the date of the contract or on the next day, the actual period taken for the despatch of the securities or the remittance of money therefor through the post being excluded from the computation of the period aforesaid if the parties to the contract do not reside in the same town or locality;  (b) transfer of the securities by the depository from the account of a beneficial owner to the account of another beneficial owner when such securities are dealt with by a depository  Adjudication Order in respect of Shree Sudharshan Castings Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 5 of 12   Section 13 of SCRA If the Central Government is satisfied, having regard to the nature or the volume of transactions in securities in any State or States or area that it is necessary so to do, it may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declared this section to apply to such State or States or area and thereupon every contract in such State or States or area which is entered into after the date of the notification otherwise than between members of a recognised stock exchange or recognised stock exchanges in such State or States or area or through or with such member shall be illegal.  Section 16 of SCRA If the Central Government is of opinion that it is necessary to prevent undesirable speculation in specified securities in any State or area, it may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare that no person in the State or area specified in the notification shall, save with the permission of the Central Government, enter into any contract for the sale or purchase of any security specified in the notification except to the extent and in the manner, if any, specified therein.  Section 18 of SCRA Nothing contained in sections 13, 14, 15 and 17 shall apply to spot delivery contracts.  SEBI Notification G.S.R 219(E) dated March 2, 2000 \\\\\\\\u201cIn exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 16 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956), read with Government of India Notification No. S.O. 573(E), dated 30th July, 1992, (See [1992] 75 Comp Cas (St.) 216.) and Notification No. 183(E), dated 1st March, 2000, (See page 53 supra.) issued under section 29A of the said Act, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \"the Board\") being of the opinion that it is necessary to prevent undesirable speculation in securities in the whole of India, hereby declare that no person in the territory to which the said Act extends, shall, save with the permission of the Board, enter into any contract for sale or purchase of securities other than such spot delivery contract or contract for cash or hand delivery or special delivery or contract in derivatives as is permissible under the said Act or the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992), and the rules and regulations made under such Acts and rules, regulations and bye-laws of a recognised stock exchange   Provided that any contracts for sale or purchase of Government securities, gold related securities, money market securities and ready forward contracts in debt securities entered into on the recognised stock exchange shall be entered into in accordance with-   (a) the rules or regulations or the bye-laws made under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956), or the Securities and  Adjudication Order in respect of Shree Sudharshan Castings Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 6 of 12  Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992), or the directions issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India under the said Acts;   (b) the rules made or guidelines or directions issued under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934), or the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949) or the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (46 of 1973), by the Reserve Bank of India;   (c) the provisions contained in the notifications issued by the Reserve Bank of India under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956)   10. From the off\\\\\\\\u2013market data analysis, it is noted that the Noticee had transferred 2,20,000 shares of UGL to Chetan Dogra and Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., The details of off-market transfers done by the Noticee are furnished hereunder: Sl. No. Date of transaction Name  of the Entity/ Individual to whom shares were transferred by the Noticee  Rate (in \\\\\\\\u20b9) at which the shares were sold (transferred) No. of shares transferred Amount in \\\\\\\\u20b9 Payment received Yes/No 1. 08/10/2010 Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., 105.30/- 50,000 52,65,000  No 2. 11/10/2010 Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., 110.55/- 45,000 49,74,750 No 3 12/10/2010 Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., 113.90/- 5,000 5,69,500 No 4 11/11/2010 Chetan Dogra 171.00/- 1,20,000 2,05,20,000 No Total 2,20,000 3,13,29,250 No  11. I note from the above table that it is an admitted fact that the Noticee had transferred 2,20,000 shares to Chetan Dogra and Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., between October and November, 2010, which is not disputed by the Noticee. As per the above table, the Noticee was to receive an amount of \\\\\\\\u20b93,13,29,250/- from Chetan Dogra and Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., towards consideration for sale of 2,20,000 shares. Further, I note from the records and from the submissions made by the Noticee that there is no agreement entered into by the Noticee with Chetan Dogra and Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., I also note that there is nothing on record evidencing issue of cheques by  Adjudication Order in respect of Shree Sudharshan Castings Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 7 of 12  Chetan Dogra and Daffodil Trades Pvt., Ltd., to the Noticee towards the consideration for sale of shares in off-market. I am of the view that for off-market transaction to be executed successfully, the buyer and seller should know each other and subsequently negotiate the price and quantity of the shares to be transacted. It is pertinent to note that the value of the off-market transactions done by the Noticee is substantial, yet the Noticee failed to enter into any agreement with the entities and failed to obtain any consideration for the same. In the instant case, the Noticee without receipt of any consideration and without entering into any agreement had transferred 2,20,000 shares worth \\\\\\\\u20b93,13,29,250/-  Thus, I note that the Noticee had admittedly transferred 2,20,00 shares to the aforesaid entities, without consideration. Therefore, the claim of the Noticee that the off-market transactions entered into by it with Chetan Dogra and Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., were in the nature of normal course of business and that it has no relationship with Chetan Dogra, is devoid of any merit.   12. I note that off-market transfer of shares leads to change in beneficial ownership. For the sake of assumption, if the Noticee gave the shares as loan to Chetan Dogra and Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., then it should have followed the procedure as laid down in the Depositories Act, 1996 and SEBI (Depositories and Depository Participants) Regulations, 1996 along with the relevant Bye-laws prescribed by the Depositories. However, in the instant case, I note that the Noticee followed no such procedure. I also note from the records that pursuant to receipt of shares in off-market from the Noticee, Chetan Dogra and Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., have further sold in the market. In view of the above, I am not inclined to consider the off-market transfers were done in the normal course of business, but meant for other purposes.   13. Another significant factor to be noted is that the shares were transferred to the demat account of Chetan Dogra and Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., which implies transfer of beneficial ownership of the shares. The transfer of beneficial ownership comes along with the rights and liabilities attached to the ownership of shares. The conduct of the parties, which is important in  Adjudication Order in respect of Shree Sudharshan Castings Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 8 of 12  any transaction, establishes that there was a transfer of the shares. The conduct of the parties and nature of the transactions establishes that the Noticee had entered into a transaction in off-market, without receipt of consideration, which is in contravention of the provisions relating to spot delivery contracts.   14. In this regard, I would like to draw reference to Section 16 of SCRA, which provides that if the Central Government is of opinion that it is necessary to prevent undesirable speculation in specified securities in any State or area, it may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare that no person in the State or area specified in the notification shall, save with the permission of the Central Government, enter into any contract for the sale or purchase of any security specified therein. Sub section of section 16 declares that all contracts in contravention of the provisions of sub section (1) entered into after the date of the notification issued thereunder shall be illegal. The central Government had issued a notification in the year 1969, and thereafter SEBI issued a similar Notification on March 2, 2000 in exercise of its delegated authority under section 16 of SCRA prohibiting any person in the territory of India to enter into any contract for sale or purchase of securities other than spot delivery or contract for cash or hand delivery or special delivery or contract in derivatives as is permissible under SCRA or the Act and the Rules and Regulations made there under and Rules, Regulations and Bye laws of a recognized stock exchange. In other words, the prohibition contained in the Notification means that no security could be traded in an off market transaction except by way of spot delivery contract as defined in section 2(i) of SCRA. Further this was made applicable to the whole of India vide notification dated SO 3644 dated November 29, 1962.   15. As per SEBI Notification G.S.R 219(E) dated 2nd March, 2000 no person in the territory to which SCRA extends, shall, save with the permission of SEBI, enter into any contract for sale or purchase of securities other than such spot  Adjudication Order in respect of Shree Sudharshan Castings Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 9 of 12  Delivery contract or contract for cash or hand delivery or special delivery or contract in derivatives as is permissible under the said SCRA or the SEBI Act and the rules and regulations made under such Acts and rules, regulations and bye\\\\\\\\u2010laws of a recognized stock exchange.  16. In terms of Section 13 of SCRA, any transactions in securities in an area other than between the members of a recognized stock exchange or through or with such member will be illegal, except spot delivery contracts. In the instant case, I note that the transactions carried out by the Noticee are not spot delivery contract.   17. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in its order dated July 17, 2007 in the matter of Alok Kehtan Vs. SEBI, Appeal No. 55 of 2007, upheld that: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..it is clear that the appellant sold his unlisted shares on 25.08.1999 in an off market transaction and received the sale consideration of ` 22,50,000/\\\\\\\\u2010 only in January, 2000 which is much beyond the time permitted by section 2(i) of the SCRA. Since the transaction was off market the contract for the sale of shares could only be by way of spot delivery in view of the restriction imposed by the Board under section 16 of SCRA which mandates that the sale consideration ought to have been received either on the same day of the transaction or on the following day. It is, thus, clear that the sale of shares by the appellant on 25.08.1999 in the off market transaction is violative of the restriction imposed under section 16 read with section 2(i) of SCRA.\\\\\\\\u201d  18. If the facts of the present case are tested with the touchstone of the observations made by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, it is evident that the 2,20,000 shares sold by the Noticee to Chetan Dogra and Daffodil Tradex Pvt., Ltd., in off\\\\\\\\u2010market deal i.e., outside the stock exchange mechanism, against no consideration is not in conformity with the provisions of section 2(i) of SCRA. Therefore, I am of the view that the said transactions are illegal, void and a  Adjudication Order in respect of Shree Sudharshan Castings Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 10 of 12  nullity and consequently in contravention of SEBI Notification G.S.R 219(E) dated March 2, 2000 and provisions of Section 13, 16 and 18 of SCRA.   19. Consequently, I hold that the allegation of violation of the provisions of Section 16 of SCRA, 1956 read with SEBI Notification G.S.R 219 (E) dated March 02, 2000, Section 13 and Section 18 of SCRA, 1956 read with Section 2(i) of SCRA, 1956 by the Noticee stands established.   ISSUE \\\\\\\\u2013 II: Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 23H of SCRA? 20. It is established from the foregoing paragraphs that the Noticee had carried out transfer of shares through off-market without receipt of consideration and thereby violated the provisions of Section 16 of SCRA, 1956 read with SEBI Notification G.S.R 219 (E) dated March 2, 2000, Section 13 and Section 18 of SCRA, 1956 read with Section 2(i) of SCRA, 1956. Since the aforesaid violations stands established against the Noticee, the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under Section 23H of SCRA.  21. The provisions of Section 23H of SCRA are reproduced hereunder. Section 23H of SCRA - Penalty for contravention where no separate penalty has been provided.   Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this Act, the rules or articles or bye- laws or the regulations of the recognised stock exchange or directions issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India for which no separate penalty has been provided, shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees.  ISSUE \\\\\\\\u2013 III: If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 23J of SCRA?  Adjudication Order in respect of Shree Sudharshan Castings Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 11 of 12  22. While determining the quantum of monetary penalty under Section 23H of SCRA, I have considered the factors stipulated in Section 23J of SCRA, which reads as under:  Section 23J of SCRA - Factors to be taken into account by the Adjudicating Officer   While  adjudging  quantum  of  penalty  under  section  23-I (SCRA),  the  Adjudicating  Officer  shall have due regard to the following factors, namely: (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default;  (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  23. The material made available on record has not quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee and the loss suffered by the investors as a result of the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s default. There is also no material made available on record to assess the amount of loss caused to investors or the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made by the Noticee as a result of default.   24. However, I find that the Noticee had carried out off-market transfer of 2,20,000 shares, without receipt of consideration to Chetan Dogra and Daffodil Tradex Pvt., who upon receipt of shares have sold the shares in the market. Considering the large number of shares involved in such dubious deals and that the shares were sold outside the mechanism of stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Law, I am of the view that the Noticee should be penalised suitably for the said acts of omissions and commissions.  ORDER 25. In view of the foregoing, after taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances and in exercise of power conferred upon me under Section 23I of SCRA read with Rule 5 of SCR Adjudication Rules, I hereby impose a  Adjudication Order in respect of Shree Sudharshan Castings Pvt., Ltd., in the matter of Urja Global Ltd.,  Page 12 of 12  penalty of \\\\\\\\u20b910,00,000/- (Rupees Ten lakhs only) on the Noticee i.e., Shree Sudharshan Castings Pvt., Ltd., under Section 23H of SCRA.   26. The said penalty imposed on the Noticee, as mentioned above is commensurate with the violation committed by the Noticee and acts as a deterrent factor for the Noticee and others in protecting the interest of investors.   27. The Noticee shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days from the date of receipt of this Order, either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR through online payment facility available on the SEBI website www.sebi.gov.in on the following path by clicking on the payment link. ENFORCEMENT \\\\\\\\u2192 Orders \\\\\\\\u2192 Orders of AO \\\\\\\\u2192 PAY NOW   28.

(xxi) Since, Noticee no. 1 being a connected entity was an insider as mentioned above, the employee trust formed by Noticee no. 1 i.e. Noticee no. 4 was deemed to be a connected person in terms of the Regulations 2(1)(d)(ii)(j) of PIT Regulations, 2015 as Noticee no. 2 had more than 10% holding in Noticee no. 1 (which was also the settlor of the Noticee no. 4) and the same was ultimately controlled by Noticee no. 2 and family and hence, was an insider as per Regulation 2(1)(g)(i) of PIT Regulations, 2015.

(xxiv) SCN-I alleges that Noticee no. 5 and 6, being insiders to FRL, had traded in the scrip of FRL on behalf of Noticee no. 4 while in possession of the UPSI, thereby resulting in \\\\\\\\u201cinsider trading\\\\\\\\u201d, in terms of Regulation 4(1) of the PIT Regulations, 2015.

Since, he was privy to the UPSI, he was an insider in terms of Regulations 2(1)(g)(ii) of PIT Regulations, 2015.

Noticee no. 1, 2 and 3 in their reply dated July 10, 2020 and during the personal hearing held on October 22, 2020 made inter alia the following submissions:  (i) information about the Transaction was \\\\\\\\u201cgenerally available\\\\\\\\u201d, and does not constitute UPSI for the following reasons:   (a) information about the Transaction had been widely reported across numerous media platforms, much before the dates on which the trades were undertaken by Noticee 1;Final Order in the matter of Future Retail Limited Page 12 of 77  (b) the likelihood of the Transaction was also widely covered in reports issued by various equity research houses; (c) FRL had, on 7 March 2017, specifically clarified to the stock exchanges that its board had authorized considering various options in relation to the Home Town Business; and (d) the Announcement was only a continuation or follow-on announcement in respect of information about the Transaction which was already \\\\\\\\u201cgenerally available\\\\\\\\u201d,   (ii) information about the Transaction was not price sensitive, even if it is assumed that such information was not \\\\\\\\u201cgenerally available\\\\\\\\u201d, because of the following reasons:   (a) the HomeTown Business and the FabFurnish Business constituted a significantly small and miniscule portion of FRL\\\\\\\\u2019s overall business respectively and was unlikely to contribute significantly to the price movement of the FRL shares; (b) there were other industry-wide factors (such as, demonization, Goods and Service Tax, D-Mart IPO) which significantly contributed to price movement in the shares of FRL and other retail companies in India during that period, and the Transaction itself was not determinative of such price movement; (c) various equity research houses had also issued research reports which had recommended a strong future for the retail sector (particularly for FRL) which contributed to FRL price movement; and (d) price movement, if any, could be explained by a number of other factors / events, and not necessarily the Transaction.   (iii) Noticee 3, who took trading decisions on behalf of Noticee 1, did not have access to any information about the Transaction, which, in any case, did not constitute UPSI, because of the following reasons:   (a) Noticee 3 has no role to play with respect to the retail business, and his primary involvement is with respect to textile manufacturing and brand development;Final Order in the matter of Future Retail Limited Page 13 of 77  (b) Noticee 3 is not an employee, executive or director at FRL; (c) Noticee 3 and Noticee 2 operate out of different residential and office premises \\\\\\\\u2013 in fact, we have had occasion to correct SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s presumption about Noticee 3\\\\\\\\u2019s residential address vide letter dated 21 February 2020; (d) no communications between Noticee 3 and Noticee 2 in connection with FRL\\\\\\\\u2019s business, or with respect to decisions to trade in shares of FRL and no business of FRL was ever discussed or considered at any board meetings of Noticee 1; and (e) Noticee 3 is financially independent from Noticee 2.   (iv) Noticee 2 and Noticee 3, both being directors on the board of Noticee 1 does not imply that Noticee 3 is an \\\\\\\\u201cinsider\\\\\\\\u201d for the purposes of the PIT Regulations because of the following reasons:   (a) there is nothing on record or brought to bear by SEBI to suggest that there was any communication between Noticee 3 and Noticee 2 in connection with FRL\\\\\\\\u2019s business, or with respect to decisions to trade in shares of FRL; (b) no business of FRL was ever discussed or considered at any board meetings of Noticee 1; and (c) such an approach of presuming communication of information would fall foul of the explicit ruling of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of Chintalapati Srinivasa Raju vs Securities and Exchange Board of India;   (v) no evidence has been shown in the SCNs which substantiates a violation of PIT Regulations by Noticee 2, in that, there is no evidence shown in the SCNs that Noticee 2 traded in the securities of FRL, either on his own behalf or on behalf of Noticee 1.   7. Noticee no. 4, 5 and 6 in their reply dated July 10, 2020 and during the personal hearing held on October 22, 2020 made inter alia the following submissions:  (i) Noticee 4 is not a \\\\\\\\u201cperson\\\\\\\\u201d for it to be a connected person in relation to FRL for the following reasons:Final Order in the matter of Future Retail Limited Page 14 of 77  (a) a trust is not a legal entity such as a company \\\\\\\\u2013 it is not a body corporate and is merely the name of the relationship between the trustee and the beneficiary in respect of application and use of the trust property; (b) the role of Noticee 1 in the trust was of a settlor and was limited to making contributions to the trust corpus, to be held in trust on behalf of and for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust (not being promoters or part of the promoter group); (c) once contributions to the trust property were completed, the control, administration and management of the trust property was undertaken by IDBI (i.e. a professional trusteeship management company), at its discretion or based on instructions; and (d) the Trust Deed makes it clear that Noticee 4 has been set up for the benefit of the \\\\\\\\u2018Beneficiaries\\\\\\\\u2019, which explicitly excludes the promoter/promoter group (specifically Noticee 2) since promoters cannot get stock options.  (ii) Noticee 4 acted in a bona fide manner based on instructions given by a third-party (i.e. Noticee 5), and should not be penalized for acting pursuant to valid instructions issued to it for the following reasons:  (a) the acquisition of FRL shares by IDBI on behalf of Noticee 4 was taken based on instructions given by Noticee 5 and Noticee 6, pursuant to the authority granted by the NRC through resolution dated 19 December 2016; and (b) there is no evidence in the SCNs regarding IDBI having access to and/or being in the possession of any UPSI, and therefore, there is no question of Noticee 4 or IDBI having acted in violation of the PIT Regulations.  (iii) Noticee 5 and Noticee 6 are not connected with FRL in any manner for the following reasons:  (a) they are vested with the responsibilities of being part of the company secretarial or finance function at other promoter group companies of the Biyani family and have no association with FRL;Final Order in the matter of Future Retail Limited Page 15 of 77  (b) they were not part of the team formed for the purposes of the Transaction; (c) they were not involved in any of the operation, management, secretarial or administrative activities of FRL in any manner; and (d) they had not directly / indirectly interacted / associated with the employees of FRL in relation to the Transaction prior to the Announcement;  (iv) Noticee 5 and Noticee 6 were not aware of the Transaction and did not have any information in respect of the Transaction, prior to the Announcement for the following reasons:  (a) merely because Noticee 5 and Noticee 6 report to Noticee 2 does not make them connected persons to Noticee 2 or associated with FRL; (b) common directorship between the Noticees and members of the extended Biyani family, does not imply that the Noticees are \\\\\\\\u201cconnected persons\\\\\\\\u201d to FRL since SEBI has also not produced any evidence to show that business of FRL was ever discussed or considered by such Future Group companies; (c) there is no frequency of communication between the Noticees and Noticee 2, as alleged by SEBI, since only 11 emails were exchanged between them in a cumulative period of 5 months prior to the Announcement, all of which were in the nature of general company-wide emails; and (d) the pre-clearances obtained by Noticee 5 on behalf of Noticee 1 was part of Noticee 5\\\\\\\\u2019s role as company secretary of Noticee 1.  (v) the instructions given by Noticee 5 and Noticee 6 to IDBI for acquisition of shares of FRL on behalf of Noticee 4 were bona fide instructions for the following reasons:  (a) the instructions were given pursuant to the authorizations granted by the NRC to the Noticees, which authorized them to take day-to-day decisions relating to the ESOP Plan; and (b) the instructions were given in order to comply with pre-existing contractual obligations as set out under the Grant Letter.Final Order in the matter of Future Retail Limited Page 16 of 77   8.

However, in accordance with the manner laid out in the FRL Code of Conduct:  (a) designated persons working on the Transaction executed undertakings pursuant to which the trading window was deemed to be closed for such persons and such undertakings had been executed by the relevant FRL personnel;  (b) there was no requirement for the Noticee to have issued a separate notice in relation to the closure of the trading window since the information in question was not UPSI, and in addition, persons involved in the Transaction had undertaken that ", "Date": "2021-02-03", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Final Order in the matter of Future Retail Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/feb-2021/final-order-in-the-matter-of-future-retail-limited_49001.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 59410, "unique_record_id": "353a6b9c7fSEBI20210203", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "668103597858910306471dc0", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 07:03:15", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Insider Trading", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "17,78,25,000 INR  \n2,75,68,650 INR  \n13,320 INR", "gpt_audience": "1. **Regulatory Authorities**: Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\n2. **Legal Professionals**: Lawyers and legal advisors specializing in securities law and corporate governance.\n3. **Corporate Management**: Executives and board members of Future Retail Limited and associated entities.\n4. **Investors and Shareholders**: Individuals and institutional investors with stakes in Future Retail Limited.\n5. **Compliance Officers**: Professionals responsible for ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements.\n6. **Financial Analysts**: Analysts tracking the performance and regulatory compliance of Future Retail Limited.\n7. **Auditors**: Internal and external auditors reviewing the financial and operational integrity of the company.\n8. **Media and Journalists**: Reporters covering corporate governance, financial markets, and regulatory actions.\n9. **Employees of Future Retail Limited**: Staff members who may be impacted by the outcomes of the regulatory findings.\n10. **Academic Researchers**: Scholars studying corporate governance, insider trading, and securities regulation.", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

ISSUE No. 1:  Whether Dezire has, prima facie, violated any provisions of IA Regulations?  6. Risk Profiling and Suitability Assessment:  6.1 Risk Profiling and non-communication of risk profile to clients: 6.1.1 As per Regulation 16 (a) and 16(b) of IA Regulations, IA is required to obtain information about the client which includes age, investment objective, income details, existing investments, risk appetite, liabilities, etc. for the purpose of determination and quantification of risk appetite of the client.  As per Regulation 16(e) of IA Regulations, the IA is under obligation to communicate the risk profile of the client after risk assessment is done.  6.1.2 During the inspection, on sample basis, Risk profile of 47 clients and proof of communication of risk profile for such clients were sought from Dezire Research. It is noted that out of 47 clients, only in 10 cases Dezire Research was able to submit proof for communication of risk profile to the clients. There was no evidence for the______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Dezire Research    Page 7 of 26  remaining 37 clients. In the absence of proof of communication to clients, I am of the view that such clients have no understanding of the risk profile done by Dezire Research for themselves. The risk profiling of the client is a crucial process. The investment advice sent to the clients need to be appropriate to the risk profile of the client. Since all the information for carrying out risk profiling are obtained through telephone conversation, it is all the more important to send the risk profile statement to clients and clients should be given a fair amount of time to revert or raise objection in case of any disagreement with the risk profiling statement. Regulation 16 (e) of IA Regulation provides that risk profile of the client shall be communicated to the client after risk assessment is done. From the sample, it is noted that in majority of the cases, the IA has not communicated risk profile to the clients. Therefore, it is prima facie found that out of 47 sample clients, Dezire Research has not communicated risk profile for 37 clients and it had sold the products to its clients without following due procedure mandated under IA Regulations.  6.1.3 Thus, from the above it is prima facie found that Dezire Research has not communicated risk profile score for 37 clients and it had sold the products to those clients without following due procedure mandated under IA Regulations. Thereby, Dezire Research has not acted with honesty, fairness and in the best interest of its clients. In view of the same, Dezire Research has prima facie (a) failed to comply with regulation 16 (e) of IA Regulations; and (b) failed to abide by clauses 1 and 5 of Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Dezire Research has prima facie violated the provision of Regulation 16 (e) and clauses 1 and 5 of Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations.  6.2 Advisory Services Offered Prior to communication of Risk Profiling:  6.2.1 As per regulation 17 of IA Regulations, the IA has to ensure that all investments on which investment advice is provided is appropriate to the risk profile of the client. During the inspection, from the analysis of the cases where risk profile has been sent to the clients, it is noted that prior to communicating the risk profile, the______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Dezire Research    Page 8 of 26  investment advisory services have already started. Also, before the communication of risk profiling, the IA charged huge amount as fees from certain clients. 6.2.2 The details of timelines for 10 sample cases are as under: S.No.      Client name      Date on which risk profile is forwarded to the client    Date of first payment as per the client master    Amount charged before the communication of risk profile to the client (Rs.) 01 Vikash kumar Singh June 20, 2018 June 07, 2018 71,613 02 Kali Charan March 09, 2018 Nov 21, 2017 4,73,000 03 Savita Meena / Hajarilal Meena March 28, 2018 March 21,2018 48,000 04 Gajendra Kumar Singh May 08, 2018 May 05, 2018 5,000 05 Subrat Sahoo July 19, 2018 July 16, 2018 14,025 06 Jatinder Singh July 17, 2018 July 12, 2018 50,000 07 Mahesh Waman December 07, 2017 October 17, 2017 1,66,805 08 Umed chand July 29, 2018 July 23, 2018 13,000 09 Mukesh singh November 14, 2017 October 27, 2017 54,209 10 Prabhakar Sidhayya Maheshwaram July 17, 2018 July 13, 2018 41,760  6.2.3 It is observed from the above table that Dezire Research sold its advisory products and collected fees from the clients, even before it had communicated the risk profile of the clients i.e., the client has not had an opportunity to verify whether his/ her risk category has been correctly arrived at. In the case of Mr. Kali Charan, the difference between the date on which payment was received and risk profiling was communicated, was more than three months. Thus, it is prima facie observed that the products/services had already been sold by the IA and advisory fees had been collected from the client and services commenced even before communication of the risk profiling to the client.   6.2.4 Therefore, from the above it is prima facie found that the products sold by Dezire Research to its clients could be completely inappropriate to the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 need, as the risk profiling has not been communicated to the client before selling the product.  It is also noted that the client has no means to know/verify whether information related to him has been correctly included in his / her risk profile statement and whether the Risk Assessment Form correctly reflects the risk assessment of the______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Dezire Research    Page 9 of 26  client, if the risk profile statement is not sent to the client. Thereby, the IA has not acted with due skill, care, diligence, honesty and in the best interest of its clients while providing investment advice appropriate to the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 risk profile.   6.2.5 In view of the same, Dezire Research has prima facie (a) failed to provide the investment advice appropriate to the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 risk profile in accordance with regulation 17 (a) of IA Regulations; and (b) failed to send risk profile statements / forms to the clients in accordance with Regulation 16(e) of IA Regulations; and (c) failed to abide by clauses 1 and 2 of the Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Dezire Research has prima facie violated the provisions of Regulation 17(a) and (b), 16 (e) and clauses 1 and 2 of the Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations.  6.3 Suitability Assessment:  6.3.1 As per Regulation 17 of the IA Regulations, the investment advice given should be appropriate to risk profile of clients; the IA should have a documented process for selecting investments to its clients based on their investment objective and financial situation; IA should understand the nature and risks of products or assets selected for clients; IA shall have reasonable basis for believing that a recommendation meets the client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment objective and the client is able to bear any related investment risks consistent with its investment objectives and risk tolerance; IA shall ensure that the client has the necessary experience and knowledge to understand the risks involved in the transaction; and the IA has to ensure that a recommendation given to client is based on reasonable assessment that the risk reward profile of financial product is consistent with client\\\\\\\\u2019s experience, knowledge, investment objective and risk appetite.  6.3.2 It is noted that during inspection, suitability of investment advice by Dezire Research has been analyzed by considering the products / services sold to 64 clients on sample basis. It is noted from the sample cases that IA provided investment advisory services without paying any attention to the risk profile and suitability of the advice to the client. A few instances are reproduced hereunder for reference:______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Dezire Research    Page 10 of 26  I.  SUBRAT SAHOO The risk profile of client provides that the proposed investment amount is up-to Rupees One Lakh. An amount of Rs. 1.4 lakhs have been charged by Dezire Research as advisory fees during the period 5 months from July 16, 2018 to November 23, 2018. From the analysis of invoices and SMS logs, it is noted that the client had subscribed to the Standard Cash services. It is however observed that tips for undertaking trades in Options have also been sent to the client. The screenshot of such an instance is reproduced hereunder:   As per the risk profiling form, the client falls under the medium risk category. This shows that though the client had medium risk appetite, yet high risk services/ tips have also been sent to the clients. From the above, I note that the IA provided investment advisory services without paying any attention to the risk profile and suitability of the advice to the client. II. MOHAMMAD ZAID SHAIKH The client is 20 years old and his annual income is less than Rs. 1 Lakh and also the proposed investment amount by the client is upto Rs 1 Lakh. The risk profile of client provides that the client has medium risk appetite. It is, however, observed that the services/ tips relating to options have also been sent to the client inconsistent with his risk profile. The screenshot of such an instance is reproduced hereunder:   III. DESH CHAND SHARMA The risk profile of the client provides that the proposed investment amount by the client is upto Rs 1 Lakh. It is also noted that the advisory fee charged by Dezire Research is more than Rs. 6 Lakhs within 2 months. The client is senior citizen aged 83 years. As per the risk profile, the client falls in moderate risk category. It is however observed that the client has been offered advisory services pertaining to high risk products viz. MPOS option service. The screenshot of such an instance is reproduced hereunder:______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Dezire Research    Page 11 of 26    6.3.3 It is noted from the sample analysis that Dezire Research has not adhered to the suitability of advisory product/ service sold to its clients. From the analysis of the data pertaining to clients on sample basis, it is observed that the products/services sold to the clients were not commensurate with the risk profile of the client. It appears that the products/ services have been sold to the client with the sole purpose of generating maximum income to the IA while showing scant regard to the suitability of such services to the client.   6.3.4 Thus, from the above, it is prima facie found that Dezire Research has given investment advice without adhering to suitability of services. It is also prima facie found that by not adhering to suitability of services, Dezire Research has not acted with due skill, care, diligence, honesty, fairly and in the best interest of its clients while selling products/services to its clients. In view of the same, Dezire Research has prima facie (a) failed to adhere to suitability of services provided to its clients in accordance with Regulation 17 of IA Regulations; and (b) failed to abide by clauses 1 and 2 of Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Dezire Research has prima facie violated the provision of Regulations 17 of IA Regulations and clauses 1 and 2 of the Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations.  7. Unfair and unreasonable advisory service fee charged from the client:  7.1 As per clause 6 of code of conduct specified in third Schedule of IA Regulations, an investment adviser, advising a client may charge fair and reasonable fees, subject to any ceiling as may be specified by the Board, if any. I note that the examination has prima facie found the following instances of collection of unreasonable / unfair fee.   7.2 From the examination of sample invoices of 64 clients, it is noted that Dezire Research has charged fees disproportionate to the annual income/proposed investment amount______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Dezire Research    Page 12 of 26  of the clients, as disclosed in the respective risk profile forms of the clients. The following instances are noted in this regard:  I ANOOP ALEX ABRAHAM   a. The risk profile of client mentions that the proposed investment amount by the client is Rs 1 to 2 Lakhs and the annual income of the client is Rs 5 to 10 Lakhs. However, the advisory fees charged by Dezire Research is more than Rs 32 Lakhs over a period of 17 months i.e. from August 14, 2017 to January 07, 2019.  II. XAVIER NADAR  a. The risk profile of client mentions that the proposed investment was only Rs. 1 to 2 lakhs. However, overall 36 times payments have been obtained from the client and more than Rs.  18 Lakhs have been charged as service fees over a period of 8 months i.e. from May 12, 2017 to December 29, 2017.  III. KAMAL KISHORE GUPTA  a. The risk profile of client mentions that the proposed investment amount by the client is between Rs 1 to Rs. 2 Lakh. It is, however, observed that Dezire Research charged more than Rs. 15 Lakhs in just 5 months (i.e. during the period from April 12, 2017 to September 14, 2017), as advisory fees.    IV.MOHAMMAD ZAID SHAIKH a. The risk profile of client mentions that the client is 20 years old and his annual income is less than Rs. 1 Lakh and also the proposed investment amount by the client is upto Rs 1 Lakh. It is, observed that Dezire Research charged are more than Rs 3 Lakhs during the period from August 20, 2018 to August 24, 2018 i.e. 4 days as advisory fees.  V.SHIVAKUMAR CHOUGULE______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Dezire Research    Page 13 of 26  a. The risk profile of client provides that the proposed investment amount by the client is upto Rs.1 Lakh. It is, however, observed that Dezire Research had charged an amount of more than Rs. 27 Lakhs towards advisory fees in just 5 months (i.e. during the period from August 21, 2017 to January 31, 2018). Further, in 5 months, more than 20 times, payments have been obtained from the client.   7.3 From the above mentioned sample cases, it is prima facie found that Dezire Research has charged fees which are disproportionate to the annual income and/or proposed investments of its clients. 7.4 In order to determine the \\\\\\\\u201creasonableness\\\\\\\\u201d of the fee charged by the Investment Adviser, I note that while no fixed standard can be devised to term whether the conduct of charging fee answers the test of reasonableness, it cannot also be stated that the reasonableness of the fee charged cannot be judged at all. The IA Regulations provides for the principle based determination of fee by the Investment Adviser indicating that such fees have to be fair and reasonable and the same can be tested as a violation of the Code of Conduct. What is reasonable in a particular circumstance may be the outcome of several factors which are relevant for such determination. While determining the reasonableness of the fee, the same has to be seen from the perspective of various factors such as proportionality etc. It is noted that Dezire Research has not been fair in its dealing with the clients as outlined above in view of disproportionate fee.  I prima facie find that in view of the fee being disproportionate to the annual income and/or proposed investment of client, the fees are qualified as \\\\\\\\u201cunreasonable\\\\\\\\u201d.  7.5 Dezire Research sold the same advisory products/services to the clients before completion of the tenure of the previous service. It is observed that, in a few clients\\\\\\\\u2019 cases, during the initial months, Dezire Research took money and sold services/ products to clients, which would commence after 2/3 years from the date of payment done by the client. This in effect forces the investors to stay with the IA without any opportunity to sever their ties in case of dis-satisfaction with its services. This also in effect locks in the clients to continue with the services of the IA as the payment for the______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Dezire Research    Page 14 of 26  services have already been paid in advance and there is a \\\\\\\\u2018No Refund\\\\\\\\u2019 policy followed by the IA.  7.6 It is also noted from the following instances that Dezire Research sold the same advisory product/service more than once with overlapping subscription period and charged hefty amount as fees:  I.

However, none of the Noticees had appeared for the personal hearing.  Thereafter, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted by SEBI, to Yalsco and its Directors, on August 20, 2020.  Prem Lal and Mamta Dewangan appeared for themselves and the Company (through video conference from the Central Jail, Durg, Chhattisgarh) and had reiterated the submissions contained in their reply dated March 13, 2019, to the SCN.  Nisha Dewangan (sister of Mamta Dewangan) appeared for herself through video conference and had reiterated the submissions contained in her reply dated August 14, 2020, to the SCN.

Formation of the Company: Prem Lal has stated that his wife and he belong to a rural area and several companies were operating in their area (district/region) which were raising funds from the public for the past 10\\\\\\\\u201315 years.  However, the head offices of such companies were situated in some other states.  They had no knowledge as to whether these companies were actually working on any project or not, but in the brochures of the companies they made mention of large scale projects for which they were raising funds.  Prem Lal has further stated that he was working as a Life Insurance Corporation of India (\\\\\\\\u201cLIC\\\\\\\\u201d) agent since 1997 and thereafter, started running a corporate agency of LIC post 2004.  His corporate agency could not be renewed in 2010 since he was not running any other business.  Companies from some other regions were raising funds from the investors of his region and utilizing the money so raised for development in other regions.  Similarly, he also decided to form such a company ensuring thereby development, generation of employment as well as ensuring higher returns to the investors and capital growth in his own region.  For this purpose, he consulted his lawyer who advised him to get the Company registered with the ROC and thereafter, such Company would act in accordance with the memorandum and no other approval would be required from any other authority.  His lawyer cited examples of several other companies that were already running their business and he also apprised him of the fact that in case the Company fails to make refunds to the investors/clients, it shall be liable for legal action.  Thus, Prem Lal, being unaware of the licensing process including the requirement to obtain a Certificate of registration from SEBI, started Yalsco.  iii. Business plan of the Company: Prem Lal has stated that the business plan of Yalsco was based on Utpaad (product) Booking.  Upon booking of a plot of land or any other Utpaad, agreements and certificates were issued to the client/investor specifying therein the details such as when the client/investor would receive the Utpaad, investment amount, quantity, mode of payment of booking amount whether in lumpsum or in instalments, etc.  In case a client does not opt to receive the product at the time of maturity, Yalsco may determine the approximate value of the product and make payment accordingly.  Thus, Yalsco duly purchased around 350 acres of land with the funds raised from the clients, where it launched various agricultural projects such as model fish farming, goat farming, guinea pig, mineral water plant, New Zealand rabbit, pomegranate, banana, jackfruit, etc.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Yalsco Real Estate and Agro Farming Limited Page 6 of 19 iv. FIR lodged with the police and action taken by the District Magistrate: Prem Lal has stated that the head office of Yalsco is situated in Rajnandgaon, Chhattisgarh and he himself is a resident of the same District.  Apart from Yalsco, there were 20\\\\\\\\u201325 fund raising companies which had opened their branch offices in Rajnandgaon and many of them had been operating for years.  Most of those companies defaulted on payment and had ceased their operations.  Therefore, investors of those companies were demanding police action.  Actions had already been taken against most of the companies in other districts and regions and the local police was investigating the matter at branch level.  Since Yalsco was a local company, all its projects were running in the local area only.  As there was no complaint against Yalsco, police was unable to take any action.  There was a lot of political pressure on the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police.  The police somehow managed to lodge an FIR against Yalsco by putting pressure on clients much before the maturity period and the Company was not given even a single chance to make refunds to those clients and thus, under the Chhattisgarh PID Act, District Magistrate and police initiated action against Yalsco and its Directors on July 23, 2015.  In accordance with the Chhattisgarh PID Act, in case any complaint is lodged against a company, the District Magistrate is supposed to inform the Company and an opportunity must be given to the Company to resolve the issue.  However, no such opportunity was given to Yalsco and its Directors.  Yalsco and its Directors had sought anticipatory bail.  The Director\\\\\\\\u2019s property and bank accounts as well as property and bank accounts of the Company were attached (including the properties acquired prior to formation of the Company) pursuant to which, Prem Lal became homeless.  However, Prem Lal and Mamta Dewangan had not bought any property either in their own name or in the name of any friend or relative (after collecting funds from the public).  The District Magistrate had attached the properties without any physical verification.  Further, only the area of the land was mentioned in the record and no details of the projects (worth Crores of rupees) were put on record.  Thus, before they could make refunds to the clients, Yalsco was shut down and they have been suffering for the last four and half years.  v. Attachment Order of District Magistrate and Order of Sessions Court:  The Chhattisgarh Administration, through the police and the Competent Authority, had impounded all the documents/records of the Company and had seized the office of the Company under the Chhattisgarh PID Act.  Prior to attachment of the property and bank accounts, refunds had already been made to the complainants who had lodged FIR, yet the___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Yalsco Real Estate and Agro Farming Limited Page 7 of 19 property and bank accounts were attached by the District Magistrate under the aforesaid Act vide an Order dated March 5, 2016.  As per the Chhattisgarh PID Act, the District Magistrate can attach only those bank accounts which come under his area of jurisdiction.  There were hardly 200\\\\\\\\u2013300 investors in Rajnandgaon but the District Magistrate took action for not making refunds to all the investors/clients of Yalsco despite the refunds having been made to the complainants.  The Order passed by the District Magistrate was confirmed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Sessions Court/Special Court, Rajnandgaon (under Chhattisgarh PID Act), by way of a Final Order on January 24, 2018, while deciding the matter.  On account of there being no corporate lawyer in their area, Yalsco and its Directors were not in a position to hire a corporate lawyer in the matter, therefore, they could not challenge the Order passed by the Sessions Court/ Special Court.  It has been more than two years since the Order was passed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Sessions Court/Special Court and the auction proceedings are underway.  Though the refund process has already been completed, yet the matter against the Directors is under trial in Court under various penal provisions.  vi. Chargesheet filed before the Sessions Court and Statements given by the complainants and witnesses before the Court of law:  Rajnandgaon police filed the chargesheet before the Sessions Court.  Charges were framed under Section 420 of IPC and Section 10 of Chhattisgarh PID Act on June 29, 2016.  The chargesheet contains names of all the complainants / witnesses.  A copy of the chargesheet is attached.  The complainants and other clients were produced before the Court of law as witnesses and it was clear from the statements of the witnesses that the Company had never failed to keep its promises and no one ever approached the Company for refund before maturity.  The clients were produced by the police as witnesses and the FIR was lodged before completion of the maturity period, and this issue was highlighted in print media as well as electronic media.  We were trying to obtain anticipatory bail.  Meanwhile, they made refunds to all the investors who were produced as witnesses and were asking for refund before the maturity period.  Further, some additional amount was also paid to them.  A copy of the statements given by all the witnesses before the court of law is attached.  vii. Rejection of the bail application made before the Chhattisgarh High Court, Bilaspur:  The Company\\\\\\\\u2019s Directors had applied for bail before the Sessions Court and Chhattisgarh High Court, Bilaspur 3\\\\\\\\u20134 times, but all the bail applications were rejected by the High Court on these grounds:  (a) an amount of \\\\\\\\u20b921 Crore was yet to be refunded to approximately___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Yalsco Real Estate and Agro Farming Limited Page 8 of 19 9800 clients and (b) the money was raised from the public without obtaining license from RBI or SEBI.  Yalsco and its Directors were supposed to repay an amount of \\\\\\\\u20b970,200 to the complainants.  Prem Lal has stated that they had already made refunds to the complainants and witnesses for which evidence was also produced.  However, bail was granted to only one of the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s Directors, viz. Nisha Dewangan, before filing the chargesheet.  Prem Lal has further stated that the police diary was produced before the Court on the basis of amount mentioned in the complainant\\\\\\\\u2019s complaint.  The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court treated all clients as one party and always dismissed their bail applications.  All necessary legal actions have already been taken against Yalsco and the Directors.  A copy of the Order passed by the Chhattisgarh High Court (whereby bail application was dismissed) is attached.  viii. Decision of District Consumer Forum, Durg Chhattisgarh:  After one and half year of Prem Lal\\\\\\\\u2019s confinement in jail, around 500 clients from Durg District had lodged a complaint before the District Consumer Forum, Durg, against Yalsco and its Directors alleging that the Company had been shut down and was not making any refund.  The Consumer Forum rejected their complaint stating that action has already been taken by the District Magistrate, Rajnandgaon in respect of refunds to all the investors/clients under the Chhattisgarh PID Act and the same had also been confirmed by the Sessions Court.  A copy of the decision given by District Consumer Forum, Durg and copies of other documents are attached.  ix. Application filed by agents and clients / investors of the Company before Sessions Court:  Property of the Company was attached by police and district administration and they were detained in jail.  However, their clients / investors had no grievances.  On the contrary, they were confident because the investors were getting good returns on their investments in a timely manner.  But due to the attachment proceedings initiated by the administration, plot of land and all the projects are getting ruined as they have been left unguarded.  In view of this, investors and agents filed an application before Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Sessions Court.  A copy of the application so filed before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Sessions Court is attached.  x. Prem Lal has submitted that the Chhattisgarh administration had already taken all legal actions against the Company and its Directors for its business activities (as detailed above) without obtaining license from SEBI, and further the Directors were put behind bars.  It has been submitted that whatever happened was merely due to lack of knowledge of legal provisions.  It has been further submitted that intention behind all these activities had never___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Yalsco Real Estate and Agro Farming Limited Page 9 of 19 been mala fide, instead they were ensuring capital growth in respect of the investments made by the clients / investors.  It may be noted that the Directors have been booked under Section 10 of Chhattisgarh PID Act, and as per this Section there is a provision of imprisonment and fine both.  xi. In view of all the circumstances, Prem Lal has requested no action be taken against them in respect of the ongoing proceedings initiated by SEBI.    xii. Photocopies of the following documents were attached: \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Hearing notice dated July 28, 2020, issued by SEBI. \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Chargesheet filed by the Rajnandgaon police before the Sessions Court, Rajnandgaon. \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Statements of witnesses produced before the Sessions Court, Rajnandgaon. \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Orders passed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Chhattisgarh High Court, Bilaspur (whereby bail applications were dismissed). \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Decision of the District Consumer Forum, Durg. \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Application filed by the clients and agents of the Company before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Sessions Court.  3.1 In her submissions, Nisha Dewangan submitted as under:   i. \\\\\\\\u201cI am the sister of Mamta Dewangan.  I was not aware that I was a Director in Yalsco.  Further, all the fund mobilising activities were carried out by Prem Lal and Mamta Dewangan.  ii. I did not attend any meeting of the Company and I trusted my sister and her husband, Prem Lal.  I further informed the police that of all the documents seized, only one of them had my signature.  I was employed with Med Life agency.\\\\\\\\u201d___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Yalsco Real Estate and Agro Farming Limited Page 10 of 19 FINDINGS \\\\\\\\u2013   3.2 Yalsco was incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 on December 16, 2010 with its registered office at Rajnandgaon, Chhattisgarh.  As per the details available on the MCA 21 Portal, Noticee nos. 2, 3 and 4 were appointed as Directors of the Company on December 16, 2010.  3.3 In theirs submissions, Yalsco, Prem Lal and Mamta Dewangan had stated that: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 the business plan of Yalsco was based on Utpaad (product) Booking.  Upon booking of a plot of land or any other Utpaad, agreements and certificates were issued to the client/investor specifying therein the details such as when the client/investor would receive the Utpaad, investment amount, quantity, mode of payment of booking amount whether in lumpsum or in instalments, etc.  In case a client does not opt to receive the product at the time of maturity, Yalsco may determine the approximate value of the product and make payment accordingly.\\\\\\\\u201d  3.4 As per the information available on record, it is noted that the Company had solicited money by executing (a) booking agreement booklet containing \\\\\\\\u201cApplication Form\\\\\\\\u201d and Agreement for Plot Booking, etc. and (b) on execution of the same, Registration Certificate was issued to investor, under the following payment plans: TABLE I \\\\\\\\u2013 PAYMENT PLANS NATURE OF PLANS EASY INSTALMENT PAYMENT PLAN  LUMPSUM PAYMENT PLAN   3.5 In its submissions dated November 27, 2015, the Company had admitted to having collected \\\\\\\\u20b911.60 Crore from 4716 customers and had also provided a list of properties (land) acquired by the Company, which were located in and around Rajnandgaon District.  As per the details provided therein, the Company had acquired 315 acres of land worth an acquisition cost of \\\\\\\\u20b913.35 Crore.  However, in its subsequent submissions dated August 25, 2020, the Company had stated that 350 acres of land were purchased with funds raised from clients/investors.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Yalsco Real Estate and Agro Farming Limited Page 11 of 19 3.6.1 The details of the \\\\\\\\u2018Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019 offered by Yalsco have to be considered in light of Section 11AA of the SEBI Act.  The aforesaid Section 11AA, which provides for the conditions to determine whether a scheme or arrangement is a \\\\\\\\u2018Collective Investment Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019, reads as follows:  1. \\\\\\\\u201cAny scheme or arrangement which satisfies the conditions referred to in subsection (2) or [sub-section (2A)] shall be a collective investment scheme.  [Provided that any pooling of funds under any scheme or arrangement, which is not registered with the Board or is not covered under sub-section (3), involving a corpus amount of one hundred Crore rupees or more shall be deemed to be a collective investment scheme.]  2. Any scheme or arrangement made or offered by any person under which, (i) the contributions, or payments made by the investors, by whatever name called, are pooled and utilized solely for the purposes of the scheme or arrangement; (ii) the contributions or payments are made to such scheme or arrangement by the investors with a view to receive profits, income, produce or property, whether movable or immovable from such scheme or arrangement; (iii) the property, contribution or investment forming part of scheme or arrangement, whether identifiable or not, is managed on behalf of the investors; (iv) the investors do not have day to day control over the management and operation of the scheme or arrangement.\\\\\\\\u201d  3.6.2 In the context of the above mentioned Section 11AA of the SEBI Act, the \\\\\\\\u2018Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019 offered by Yalsco is examined as under \\\\\\\\u2013   (i) The contributions, or payments made by the investors, by whatever name called, are pooled and utilized solely for the purposes of the scheme or arrangement.  a. I find that the Company had collected funds from the general public towards its scheme for the \\\\\\\\u201csale, purchase and leasing of undeveloped agricultural land of different sizes\\\\\\\\u201d in accordance with the payment plans offered in the form of equal installments or lumpsum payments.  It is noted that the Company had represented to the \\\\\\\\u201ccustomers\\\\\\\\u201d/investors that the funds so collected were to be utilized for the cost of land, brokerage, development charges, other inputs, saplings, plans, trees, crops, planting expenses, maintenance and other miscellaneous expenses.  However, no precise___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Yalsco Real Estate and Agro Farming Limited Page 12 of 19 details of the plot or the location of the property was provided in the \\\\\\\\u201cAgreement\\\\\\\\u201d or in the \\\\\\\\u2018Registration Certificate\\\\\\\\u2019.  The \\\\\\\\u201cAgreement\\\\\\\\u201d merely stated that \\\\\\\\u201cAllotment of land shall be made after receiving payment, within a period of one year in case of lumpsum payment plan, and for EIPP, after the receipt of 50% of the payment.  The land ownership would be transferred in the name of customer after the end of development period\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  b. It is therefore observed that funds have been mobilized from the public through \\\\\\\\u2018Easy Instalment Payment Plan\\\\\\\\u2019 or \\\\\\\\u2018Lumpsum Payment Plan\\\\\\\\u2019 towards the purchase and allotment of land, which was neither identifiable nor distinguishable at the time of execution of the \\\\\\\\u201cAgreement\\\\\\\\u201d between Yalsco and its \\\\\\\\u201ccustomers\\\\\\\\u201d/investors or upon payment of the consideration amount by such \\\\\\\\u201ccustomers\\\\\\\\u201d/investors.    c. Further, from the balance sheets of the Company for the Financial Years 2010\\\\\\\\u201311, 2011\\\\\\\\u201312, 2012\\\\\\\\u201313 and 2013\\\\\\\\u201314, it is noted that the Company had mobilized funds amounting to approx. \\\\\\\\u20b922.66 Crores from 9512 \\\\\\\\u201ccustomers\\\\\\\\u201d/investors (no. of investors as per information provided by the Additional Collector, Rajnandgaon, Chhattisgarh, to SEBI) which were shown as \\\\\\\\u201cAdvance from customers\\\\\\\\u201d and had also acquired land worth \\\\\\\\u20b919.92 Crores, which was shown as \\\\\\\\u201cinventories\\\\\\\\u201d, contrary to the submissions made vide the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s letter dated November 27, 2015 (refer to paragraph 3.5).  The aforesaid entry (\\\\\\\\u201cAdvance from customers\\\\\\\\u201d) represents the funds mobilized from the \\\\\\\\u201ccustomers\\\\\\\\u201d/investors under the aforementioned \\\\\\\\u2018Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019 of allotment of land during the aforesaid Financial Years, which have been utilised for the purpose of purchase of land, etc.    d. Upon a consideration of the aforementioned, I find that the contributions/payments made by the \\\\\\\\u201ccustomers\\\\\\\\u201d/investors were pooled and utilized solely for the purpose of the \\\\\\\\u2018Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019 of allotment of land as offered by Yalsco.___________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Yalsco Real Estate and Agro Farming Limited Page 13 of 19 (ii) The contributions or payments are made to such scheme or arrangement by the investors with a view to receive profits, income, produce or property, whether movable or immovable from such scheme or arrangement.  a. Under the \\\\\\\\u2018Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019 of allotment of land offered by Yalsco, an investor may opt for \\\\\\\\u2018Easy Instalment Payment Plan\\\\\\\\u2019 or \\\\\\\\u2018Lumpsum Payment Plan\\\\\\\\u2019, which would entitle him to a monetary amount at the end of the maturity period of such \\\\\\\\u2018Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019.  For example, from the \\\\\\\\u2018Registration Certificate\\\\\\\\u2019 issued by the Company to one \\\\\\\\u201ccustomer\\\\\\\\u201d/investor, viz. Ramadhar Nirmalkar, it is observed that he had opted for the \\\\\\\\u2018Lumpsum Payment Plan\\\\\\\\u2019 and had paid an amount of \\\\\\\\u20b910,00,000 with a view to receive profits or returns.  The aforementioned investor had been getting a monthly income of \\\\\\\\u20b96000 from the Company along with a commitment of \\\\\\\\u20b926,20,000 (estimate appreciation of plot\\\\\\\\u2019s price) at the end of the maturity period of such \\\\\\\\u2018Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019.  In this context, it is noted that the monetary amount is considerably higher than the amount invested by said investor. It is also noted from the \\\\\\\\u201cAgreement\\\\\\\\u201d that the Company may also offer to buy\\\\\\\\u2013back the plot of land on its appreciated price as agreed upon between the Company and its \\\\\\\\u201ccustomers\\\\\\\\u201d/investors.     b. Upon a consideration of the aforementioned, I find that the contributions/payments made by the \\\\\\\\u201ccustomers\\\\\\\\u201d/investors towards the \\\\\\\\u2018Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019 of allotment of land as offered by Yalsco, was with a view to receive profits or returns, whether movable or immovable, from such \\\\\\\\u2018Scheme\\\\\\\\u2019.

Investigation had revealed that RV Ravikumar had acquired control of three entities (private limited companies), namely BPJ Holding Pvt. Ltd. (BPJ), Nandlal Vyapaar Pvt. Ltd. (Nandlal) and Chiraag Suppliers Pvt. Ltd. (Chirag) by making payments in two tranches through his employees / business associates. It was found that though the payments for such acquisitions were made from the bank accounts of employees / business associates of RV Ravikumar, the money had actually been arranged and paid by RV Ravikumar himself for such acquisitions. Pursuant to first tranche payment, employees / business associates of Ravikumar had acquired 30.83% shareholding of BPJ, 48.53% shareholding of Nandlal and 48.46% shareholding of Chiraag. Subsequently, they had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on September 10, 2012 to acquire BPJ and Chiraag and another MoU on September 12, 2012 to acquire Nandlal. Pursuant to the above mentioned MoUs, payments were made in the second tranche by these employees / business associates thereby completing the control over BPJ, Nandlal and Chiraag.

The date of MoU to acquire BPJ was September 10, 2012. Therefore, R V Ravikumar acquired BPJ Holding Pvt. Ltd.

It is observed that no such public announcement for open offer was made by R V Ravikumar. Thus it is alleged that by making the abovementioned acquisitions on September 10, 2012, Ravikumar (Noticee no. 1) along with existing promoter entities (i.e. Noticee nos. 2 to 8) who are PACs, namely Ravikumar Properties Pvt. Ltd., Ravikumar Amrithavalli, S Rajendran, R Ramanujam, V Sivasankar, V Chitra and G Ramaraja have violated the provisions of regulation 3(1) of SAST Regulations.   33.

Ltd., Ravikumar Amrithavalli, S Rajendran, R Ramanujam, V Sivasankar, V Chitra, and G Ramaraja, along with BPJ and Chiraag, have violated the provisions of regulation 3(2) of SAST Regulations.   34.

Consideration of Issues and Findings 16. I have considered the allegations and materials available on record. On perusal of the same, the following issues arise for consideration. Each question is dealt with separately under different headings. (1) Whether the company came out with the Offer of RPS as stated in the interim order. (2) If so, whether the said offer was in violation of Section 56, Section 60 and Section 73 of Companies Act 1956. (3) If the findings on Issue No.2 are found in the affirmative, who are liable for the violation committed?  ISSUE No. 1- Whether the company came out with the Offer of RPS as stated in the interim order. 17. I have perused the interim order dated January 08, 2016 for the allegation of Offer of RPS. I note that neither the company nor the directors filed any reply disputing the fact of issuance.    18. I have also perused the documents/ information obtained from the \\\\\\\\u2018MCA 21 Portal\\\\\\\\u2019 and other documents available on records. With respect to the issuance of RPS by RBHAPL, from FORM 2 (Return of allotment) of RBHAPL, it is noted that RBHAPL had issued RPS, which are as under:  Order in the matter of R B Horticulture and Animal Project Limited Page 9 of 30 S.No. Date of allotment  Financial Year No. of investors No. of RPS Total Issued Capital  (Rs. In lakhs) 1 March 29, 2007 2006-07 365 11,243 11.24 2 August 16, 2007 2007-08 1,303 38,757 38.76 Total   1,668  50.00   19. From the above, I note that RBHAPL had issued RPS and had mobilized funds to the tune of Rs. 50 lakhs from 1,668 allottees during the Financial Year (FY) 2006-07 and 2007-08. Thus, I am of the view that RBHAPL had issued and allotted RPS in the FYs 2006-07 and 2007-08.   20. I therefore conclude that RBHAPL came out with an offer of RPS as outlined above.  ISSUE No. 2- If so, whether the said offer was in violation of Section 56, Section 60 and Section 73 of Companies Act 1956.  21. The provisions alleged to have been violated and mentioned in Issue No. 2 are applicable to the Offer of RPS made to the public. Therefore the primary question that arises for consideration is whether the issue of RPS is \\\\\\\\u2018public issue\\\\\\\\u2019.  At this juncture, reference may be made to sections 67(1) and 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956:  \"67. (1) Any reference in this Act or in the articles of a company to offering shares or debentures to the public shall, subject to any provision to the contrary contained in this Act and subject also to the provisions of sub-sections (3) and (4), be construed as including a reference to offering them to any section of the public, whether selected as members or debenture holders of the company concerned or as clients of the person issuing the prospectus or in any other manner.  Order in the matter of R B Horticulture and Animal Project Limited Page 10 of 30 (2) any reference in this Act or in the articles of a company to invitations to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures shall, subject as aforesaid, be construed as including a reference to invitations to subscribe for them extended to any section of the public, whether selected as members or debenture holders of the company concerned or as clients of the person issuing the prospectus or in any other manner. (3) No offer or invitation shall be treated as made to the public by virtue of sub- section (1) or sub- section (2), as the case may be, if the offer or invitation can properly be regarded, in all the circumstances- (a) as not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation; or (b) otherwise as being a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer or invitation \\\\\\\\u2026  Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall apply in a case where the offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or debentures is made to fifty persons or more: Provided further that nothing contained in the first proviso shall apply to non-banking financial companies or public financial institutions specified in section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956).\\\\\\\\u201d   22. The following observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited & Ors. v. SEBI (Civil Appeal no. 9813 and 9833 of 2011) (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cSahara Case\\\\\\\\u201d), while examining the scope of Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956, are worth consideration:- \\\\\\\\u201cSection 67(1) deals with the offer of shares and debentures to the public and Section 67(2) deals with invitation to the public to subscribe for shares and  Order in the matter of R B Horticulture and Animal Project Limited Page 11 of 30 debentures and how those expressions are to be understood, when reference is made to the Act or in the articles of a company. The emphasis in Section 67(1) and (2) is on the \\\\\\\\u201csection of the public\\\\\\\\u201d. Section 67(3) states that no offer or invitation shall be treated as made to the public, by virtue of subsections (1) and (2), that is to any section of the public, if the offer or invitation is not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation or otherwise as being a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer or invitations. Section 67(3) is, therefore, an exception to Sections 67(1) and (2). If the circumstances mentioned in clauses (1) and (b) of Section 67(3) are satisfied, then the offer/invitation would not be treated as being made to the public.  The first proviso to Section 67(3) was inserted by the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2000 w.e.f. 13.12.2000, which clearly indicates, nothing contained in Sub-section (3) of Section 67 shall apply in a case where the offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or debentures is made to fifty persons or more. \\\\\\\\u2026 Resultantly, after 13.12.2000, any offer of securities by a public company to fifty persons or more will be treated as a public issue under the Companies Act, even if it is of domestic concern or it is proved that the shares or debentures are not available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation.\\\\\\\\u201d  23. Section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956 provides for situations when an offer is not considered as offer to public. As per the said sub section, if the offer is one which is not calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation, or, if the offer is the domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer, the same are not considered as public offer. Under such circumstances, they are considered as  Order in the matter of R B Horticulture and Animal Project Limited Page 12 of 30 private placement of shares and debentures. It is noted that as per the first proviso to Section 67(3) Companies Act, 1956, the public offer and listing requirements contained in that Act would become automatically applicable to a company making the offer to fifty or more persons. However, the second proviso to Section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956 exempts NBFCs and Public Financial Institutions from the applicability of the first proviso.    24. In the instant matter, from FORM 2 - Return of allotment, I find that RBHAPL made an issuance of RPS to 1,668 investors during the FY 2006-07 and 2007-08 and had mobilized an amount of Rs. 50 lakhs. Thus, the above findings lead to a reasonable conclusion that the Offer of RPS by RBHAPL during the FY 2006-07 and 2007-08 was a \\\\\\\\u201cpublic issue\\\\\\\\u201d within the meaning of the first proviso to section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956.  25. I find that RBHAPL has not claimed it to be a Non\\\\\\\\u2013banking financial company or public financial institution within the meaning of Section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956. In view of the aforesaid, I, therefore, find that there is no case that RBHAPL is covered under the second proviso to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956.  26. Neither RBHAPL nor its directors have contended that the Offer of RPS does not fall within the ambit of first proviso of section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956.   27. Even in cases where the allotments are considered separately, reference may be made to Sahara Case, wherein it was held that under Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956, the \"Burden of proof is entirely on Saharas to show that the investors are/were their employees/workers or associated with them in any other capacity which they have not discharged.\" In respect of those issuances, the directors have not submitted any reply that the allotment was in satisfaction of section 67(3)(a) or 67(3)(b) of Companies Act, 1956 i.e., it was made to the known associated persons or domestic concern. Therefore, I find  Order in the matter of R B Horticulture and Animal Project Limited Page 13 of 30 that the said issuance cannot be considered as private placement. Moreover, reference may be made to the order dated April 28, 2017 of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in Neesa Technologies Limited vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 311 of 2016) which lays down that \\\\\\\\u201cIn terms of Section 67(3) of the Companies Act any issue to \\\\\\\\u201850 persons or more\\\\\\\\u2019 is a public issue and all public issues have to comply with the provisions of Section 56 of Companies Act and ILDS Regulations. Accordingly, in the instant matter the appellant have violated these provisions and their argument that they have issued the NCDs in multiple tranches and no tranche has exceeded 49 people has no meaning\\\\\\\\u201d.   28. Therefore, in view of the material available on record, I find that the Offer of RPS by RBHAPL falls within the first proviso of section 67(3) of Companies Act, 1956. Hence, the Offer of RPS are deemed to be public issues and RBHAPL was mandated to comply with the 'public issue' norms as prescribed under the Companies Act, 1956.  29. Further, since the offer of RPS is a public issue of securities, such securities shall also have to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, as mandated under section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956.  As per section 73(1) and (2) of the Companies Act, 1956, a company is required to make an application to one or more recognized stock exchanges for permission for the shares or debentures to be offered to be dealt with in the stock exchange and if permission has not been applied for or not granted, the company is required to forthwith repay with interest all moneys received from the applicants.  30. Noticees have not submitted any reply in the matter, therefore, the allegations of non-compliance of the above provisions were not denied by RBHAPL or its directors. I also find that no records have been submitted to indicate that it has made an application seeking listing permission from stock exchange or refunded the amounts on account of such failure. Therefore, I find that RBHAPL has contravened the said provisions. RBHAPL has not provided any records to show that the amount collected by it is kept in a separate bank account. Therefore, I find that RBHAPL has also not complied with the provisions of  Order in the matter of R B Horticulture and Animal Project Limited Page 14 of 30 section 73(3) which mandates that the amounts received from investors shall be kept in a separate bank account. Therefore, I find, that section 73(2) of the Companies Act, 1956 has not been complied with.  31. Section 2(36) of the Companies Act read with section 60 thereof, mandates a company to register its \\\\\\\\u2018prospectus\\\\\\\\u2019 with the RoC, before making a public offer/ issuing the \\\\\\\\u2018prospectus\\\\\\\\u2019.  As per the aforesaid Section 2(36), \\\\\\\\u201cprospectus\\\\\\\\u201d means any document described or issued as a prospectus and includes any notice, circular, advertisement or other document inviting deposits from the public or inviting offers from the public for the subscription or purchase of any shares in, or debentures of, a body corporate. As the offer of RPS was a deemed public issue of securities, RBHAPL was required to register a prospectus with the RoC under Section 60 of the Companies Act, 1956. I find that RBHAPL has not submitted any record to indicate that it has registered a prospectus with the RoC, in respect of the offer of RPS. I, therefore, find that RBHAPL has not complied with the provisions of section 60 of the Companies Act, 1956.  32. In terms of section 56(1) of the Companies Act, 1956, every prospectus issued by or on behalf of a company, shall state the matters specified in Part I and set out the reports specified in Part II of Schedule II of that Act. Further, as per Section 56(3) of the Companies Act, 1956, no one shall issue any form of application for shares in a company, unless the form is accompanied by abridged prospectus, containing disclosures as specified. Noticees have not submitted any reply in the matter, hence, neither RBHAPL nor its directors produced any record to show that it has issued Prospectus containing the disclosures mentioned in Section 56(1) of the Companies Act, 1956, or issued application forms accompanying the abridged prospectus.  Therefore, I find that, RBHAPL has not complied with Sections 56(1) and 56(3) of the Companies Act, 1956.  33. I note that the offer and allotment of RPS during the Financial Years 2006-07 and 2007-  Order in the matter of R B Horticulture and Animal Project Limited Page 15 of 30 08 were made while the SEBI (Disclosure and Investment Protection) Guidelines, 2000 (\\\\\\\\u201cDIP Guidelines\\\\\\\\u201d) were in force. Clause 1.4 of the DIP Guidelines makes the provisions contained therein applicable to all \\\\\\\\u2018public issues\\\\\\\\u2019 by listed or unlisted companies. \\\\\\\\u2018Public issue\\\\\\\\u2019 is defined in Clause 1.2 (xxiii) to mean \\\\\\\\u201can invitation by a company to public to subscribe to the securities offered through a prospectus.\\\\\\\\u201d This definition read with the provisions of the Companies Act cited earlier in this Order, makes it clear that DIP Guidelines would apply to a public offer of RPS as well. The applicability of SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 which came into force on August 26, 2009 and which repealed the DIP Guidelines is limited to RPS and convertible securities. Therefore, allotments of RPS till August 26, 2009, would be subject to the provisions of DIP Guidelines. Therefore, I hold that the Company was also required to comply with the following provisions of the DIP Guidelines read with regulation 111 of the ICDR Regulations in respect of the offer and allotments made during  FY 2006-07 and 2007-08:     a. Clause 2.1.1. \\\\\\\\u2013 (Filing of offer document);   b. Clause 2.1.4 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Application for listing);   c. Clause 2.1.5 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Issue of securities in dematerialized form),   d. Clause 2.8 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Means of finance),   e. Clause 4.1 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Promoters contribution in a public issue by unlisted companies),   f. Clause 4.11 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Lock-in of minimum specified promoters contribution in public issues),   g. Clause 4.14 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Lock-In of pre-issue share capital of an unlisted company)   h. Clause 5.3.1 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Memorandum of understanding),   i. Clause 5.3.3 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Due Diligence Certificate)   j. Clause 5.3.5 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Undertaking),   k. Clause 5.3.6 \\\\\\\\u2013 (List Of Promoters Group And Other Details),   l. Clause 5.4 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Appointment of intermediaries),   m. Clause 5.6 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Offer document to be made public),   n. Clause 5.6A \\\\\\\\u2013 (Pre-issue Advertisement),   o. Clause 5.7 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Despatch of issue material),  Order in the matter of R B Horticulture and Animal Project Limited Page 16 of 30 p. Clause 5.8 \\\\\\\\u2013 (No complaints certificate),   q. Clause 5.9 \\\\\\\\u2013 [Mandatory collection centres including Clause 5.9.1 (Minimum number of collection centres)],   r. Clause 5.10 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Authorised Collection Agents),   s. Clause 5.12.1 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Appointment of compliance officer),   t. Clause 5.13 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Abridged prospectus),  u. Clause 6.0 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Contents of offer documents),  v. Clause 8.3 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Rule 19(2)(b) of SC(R) Rules, 1957),  w. Clause 8.8.1 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Opening & closing date of subscription of securities),  x. Clause 9 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Guidelines on advertisements by Issuer Company),  y. Clause 10.1 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Requirement of credit rating),  z. Clause 10.5 \\\\\\\\u2013 (Redemption).    34. As per Regulation 111(1) of the ICDR Regulations, the DIP Guidelines \"shall stand rescinded\". However, Regulation 111(2) of the ICDR Regulations, provides that:  \"(2) Notwithstanding the repeal under sub-section (1) of the repealed enactments,\\\\\\\\u2014  (a) anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken including observation made in respect of any draft offer document, any enquiry or investigation commenced or show cause notice issued in respect of the said Guidelines shall be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of these regulations;  (b) any offer document, whether draft or otherwise, filed or application made to the Board under the said Guidelines and pending before it shall be deemed to have been filed or made under the corresponding provisions of these regulations.\"    35. Further, I note that the jurisdiction of SEBI over various provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 including the above mentioned, in the case of public companies, whether listed or unlisted, when they issue and transfer securities, flows from the provisions of Section 55A of the Companies Act, 1956.  While examining the scope of Section 55A of the Companies Act, 1956, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Sahara Case, had observed that:  Order in the matter of R B Horticulture and Animal Project Limited Page 17 of 30 \"We, therefore, hold that, so far as the provisions enumerated in the opening portion of Section 55A of the Companies Act, so far as they relate to issue and transfer of securities and non-payment of dividend is concerned, SEBI has the power to administer in the case of listed public companies and in the case of those public companies which intend to get their securities listed on a recognized stock exchange in India.\" \"SEBI can exercise its jurisdiction under Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11A(1)(b) and 11B of SEBI Act and Regulation 107 of ICDR 2009 over public companies who have issued shares or debentures to fifty or more, but not complied with the provisions of Section 73(1) by not listing its securities on a recognized stock exchange\"  36. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that by virtue of Section 55A of the Companies Act, 1956, SEBI has to administer Section 67 of that Act, so far as it relates to issue and transfer of securities, in the case of companies who intend to get their securities listed. While interpreting the phrase \\\\\\\\u201cintend to get listed\\\\\\\\u201d in the context of deemed public issue the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in Sahara Case observed-   \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026But then, there is also one simple fundamental of law, i.e. that no-one can be presumed or deemed to be intending something, which is contrary to law. Obviously therefore, \\\\\\\\u201cintent\\\\\\\\u201d has its limitations also, confining it within the confines of lawfulness\\\\\\\\u2", "Date": "2021-02-02", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Final Order in the matter of R B Horticulture and Animal Project Limited", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/feb-2021/final-order-in-the-matter-of-r-b-horticulture-and-animal-project-limited_49002.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 59360, "unique_record_id": "bad5e72fe9SEBI20210202", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6681001c7858910306471d8a", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 06:49:32", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Non-compliance", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "No financial penalties mentioned.", "gpt_audience": "1.

From an analysis of Bank statements, the following is observed: 8.3.1. The aforesaid bank accounts are active.  8.3.2. The total credit received in the aforesaid bank accounts including Paytm and PayUmoney gateway is approximately Rs. 21,82,648/- during the period April 10, 2017 to December 11, 2020.    9. In light of the aforesaid discussions, I prima facie observe that NSAR has been putting information in public domain / advertising by using website namely www.nationalstockadvisory.com  about the various Services offered by it in securities market. It is also prima facie observed that various plans / packages are being offered by NSAR to avail their Services. Thus, I prima facie observe, that NSAR is prima facie, holding itself out as an investment Adviser. In view of the above facts and circumstances, especially the content of the website coupled with the credit transactions in the bank accounts, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees / funds credited to the bank accounts, Paytm and PayU money, were for the purpose of availing the Services indicated on the website of NSAR and it is carrying out Services related to investments in securities market as mentioned on its website and it is acting as an advisor in securities market from April 10, 2017 till date.  10. In this regard, I have perused the definition of investment Adviser as given in regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, which states that investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment Adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have also perused the Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines investment advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of National Stock Advisory Research                                                                                       Page 8 of 16  11. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is, prima facie noted, from the contents of the website of NSAR, that NSAR is prima facie, holding itself out as investment Adviser by offering to provide services related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription and these services fall within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advice\\\\\\\\u201d under Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations. Further, multiple credit entries have been received in the bank accounts, which when seen together with the contents of the website, leads to, on preponderance of probability basis, a prima facie, conclusion that the credit entries in the bank account are consideration for the investment advice given by NSAR to its clients. Thus, prima facie, NSAR is an investment Adviser as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations.  12. The fact that NSAR is offering various subscription packages in various segments of the market viz, equity, derivatives and commodity, when seen in light of the receipt of money in its bank accounts, prima facie shows, on preponderance of probability basis, that the credit of money, is in fact, the fee for the investment advisory Services rendered by NSAR. Therefore, NSAR has not only held itself out as investment Adviser but has also acted as an Investment Adviser for consideration.  ISSUE No. 2:  If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether NSAR has, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act read with IA Regulations?   13. In order to ensure that investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of SEBI Act states that  \\\\\\\\u201cNo  stock  broker,  sub -broker,  share  transfer  agent,  banker  to  an  issue,  trustee  of  trust deed,  registrar  to  an  issue,  merchant  banker,  underwriter,  portfolio  manager,  investment Adviser  and  such  other  intermediary  who  may  be  associated  with  securities  market  shall  buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration  obtained  from  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the regulations  made under  this Act\\\\\\\\u201d__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of National Stock Advisory Research                                                                                       Page 9 of 16  14. Further, Regulation 3(1) of the IA regulations, states that \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment Adviser or hold itself out as an investment Adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.   15. Thus, as per Section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Regulation 3(1) of IA Regulations, any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI regulations i.e. the registration of the investment Advisers is mandatory.   16. The activities of NSAR, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions shows that NSAR is holding itself out as investment Advisers and is acting as investment Advisers. However, no material was available on record to indicate that NSAR or its proprietor Mr. Neeraj S Lodhi in their individual capacity had a certificate of registration as an Investment Adviser. In this context, it is noted that NSAR and Mr. Neeraj S Lodhi in their individual capacity are not registered with SEBI as an intermediary. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by NSAR, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, leads to the conclusion that NSAR is holding itself out and acting as investment Advisers without a certificate of registration from SEBI. In my view, these activities/ representations of NSAR are, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.  ISSUE NO. 3:  If answers to Issue Nos. 1 & 2 are affirmative, who are responsible for the violations? 17. I note that Mr. Neeraj S Lodhi is the sole proprietor of NSAR. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in Ashok Transport Agency vs. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business. A suit by or against a proprietary concern is by or against the proprietor of the business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Mr. Neeraj S Lodhi is liable for the acts of NSAR.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of National Stock Advisory Research                                                                                       Page 10 of 16  ISSUE NO. 4:  If answer to Issue No. 2 is in affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any should be issued against those responsible for the violations?  18. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of regulating investment advisory activities to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of investment advisory activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations inter alia seek to create a structure within which investment Advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment Advisers to comply with the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market.  19. In the instant case, it is noted that Noticees are soliciting and inducing the investors to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips, intra-day calls etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration as mandated under the IA Regulations. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Noticees, from collecting any more fees from the public and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. It is noted from material available on record that transaction took place in the bank account of Mr. Neeraj S Lodhi / NSAR as recently as on November 28, 2020 in SBI. Moreover, the website of NSAR, www.nationalstockadvisory.com, is still active. Furthermore, the details of NSAR including its location, email (enquiry can be sent to NSAR by an email) and telephone number are mentioned on its aforementioned website. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Noticees in the securities market is still in existence and imminent. The total amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by NSAR is Rs. 21,82,648/- and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of National Stock Advisory Research                                                                                       Page 11 of 16 20. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from the unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from unregistered investment advisor not in consonance with the IA Regulations vis-a-vis an investor who receives such service from registered investment Adviser following the IA Regulations stands in a disadvantageous position in respect of  his protection as investor as envisaged under the IA regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not even satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment Adviser. Availing of service from such person is detrimental to investors and such unqualified service can result in irreparable detriment as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victim of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury to the development of the securities market also qualifies as \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable detriment\\\\\\\\u201d as the objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market.  21. Further, if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may subscribe by parting with significant fees and may cause irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is right of the current entity herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the \\\\\\\\u201cex-parte orders in the case of private suits\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cex-parte public enforcement actions\\\\\\\\u201d, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential loss of investment by the investors by following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if prima facie unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of National Stock Advisory Research                                                                                       Page 12 of 16 an exparte-interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favour of Noticees.  22. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie, findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Noticees from collecting any more funds from the public and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. As noted in the preceding paragraphs, monies were being credited in the bank accounts as on November 28, 2020 and bank accounts are still active. Moreover, the website of NSAR is active. The same prima facie demonstrates that Noticees can still lure investors to deal through it in the securities market and probability of investors reaching Noticees is still high. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Noticees in the securities market is still in existence and imminent.  23. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Noticees is approximately Rs. 21,82,648/- and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors. In light of the same, I find that there is no other alternative but to take recourse through an interim ex-parte order against Noticees for preventing them from collecting funds by defrauding investors and by indulging in unauthorized investment advisory Services without obtaining the mandatory registrations from SEBI in accordance with the law. As the website of NSAR is active which prima facie, shows that the investors can reach it and also its bank accounts are active, the balance of convenience demands the preventive measure of stopping the collection of money in the above-mentioned bank accounts from investors. The same can be effectively achieved by an appropriate direction of stopping credit into the above-mentioned bank account. As Noticees have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, the balance of convenience also demands that Noticees have to be prevented from diverting the funds collected from the investors through the fraudulent and unauthorized investment advisory activity. Accordingly, an appropriate direction stopping the debit from the above-mentioned bank account has been incorporated.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of National Stock Advisory Research                                                                                       Page 13 of 16 24. With the initiation of quasi-judicial proceedings, given the fact that Noticees have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, it is possible that Noticees may divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients. The same may result in defeating the effective implementation of the direction of refund, if any, to be passed after deciding the matter on merits. It therefore becomes necessary for SEBI to take urgent steps to prevent Noticees from diverting the money collected from the subscribers / clients. It is also essential to take urgent steps to prevent them from alienating any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets, so that the final remedies, if any, do not become infructuous. In view of the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove, and considering the interests of already existing clients of Noticees and also the interests of those who may fall prey to the unregistered investment advisory by reaching Noticees through the website, the balance of convenience lies against the Noticees, which requires immediate action against them including not to divert the money collected from the subscribers / clients / investors.

(hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018NIIT\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018Applicant\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018Company\\\\\\\\u2019) during the period  December 22, 2014 to March 23, 2015 (hereinafter referred as \\\\\\\\u2018Investigation period\\\\\\\\u2019) and inter alia observed certain violations of the provisions of the Equity Listing Agreement and SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018LODR Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019) alleged to have been committed by NIIT.  2. Pursuant to the investigation, SEBI appointed Dr Anitha Anoop as the Adjudicating Officer (AO) vide communiqu\\\\\\\\xe9 dated May 04, 2020 under Section 23 I of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act 1956 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCRA\\\\\\\\u2019) read with Rule 3 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018 SCRA Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019), to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions Section 23E of the SCRA, for the violation of the provisions of Listing agreement / LODR Regulations alleged to have been committed by NIIT. Pursuant to transfer of Dr Anitha Anoop to another department, the undersigned has been appointed as the AO in the matter, vide communique dated November 03, 2020. 3. In this regard, a Show Cause Notice ref.no. SEBI/EAD/AA/KL/12850/2020 dated August 06, 2020, (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to NIIT.  Briefly, the following major observations were made against NIIT in the  SCN:Page 2 of 5  a) On March 23, 2015, NIIT made an announcement on the Stock exchanges (BSE and NSE) that a dispute has arisen between one of its subsidiaries and one of its clients, which may result in claims and counter claims and that the company has provisioned USD 10 million for the same. Further, it is noted from the annual report of NIIT for FY 2014-15 that the above mentioned dispute had a total impact of Rs. 80 crores, which in turn is 3.37% of the consolidated revenue of the company (Rs. 2,372.5 crore) for the F.Y. 2014-15.  b) In this context, the submissions made by NIIT were perused and it is alleged that NIIT was aware of the situation regarding the dispute since December 22, 2014, when a law firm advised NIIT and its subsidiary to resolve the dispute through dispute resolution process. It was also observed that an amount equivalent to the aforesaid disputed amount viz. USD 10 million was approved in the Board meeting of the company held on January 14, 2015. Further, it is seen that the company\\\\\\\\u2019s subsidiary received a default notice from its client on March 13, 2015, which was immediately informed to the company. However, it is alleged that the company made the corporate announcement regarding the dispute in the context of receiving default notice only on March 23, 2015. c) In this regard, it is observed that on the subsequent day of making the aforementioned corporate disclosure viz. March 24, 2015, the scrip price of NIIT opened at Rs. 367.1 on BSE and touched a low of Rs. 340 before closing at Rs. 350.75.  Thus, the price of the scrip decreased by 6.37% on BSE on March 24, 2015 from the previous day\\\\\\\\u2019s closing price. Similarly, the price of the scrip fell by 5.96% on NSE on March 24, 2015. Therefore, the above announcement made by the company was, prima facie, considered as a price sensitive information (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018PSI\\\\\\\\u2019) in terms Regulation 2(ha) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018PIT Regulations - 2015\\\\\\\\u2019). d) As per the terms of Clause 36 of the equity listing agreement, a listed company is obligated to inform the stock exchange on an immediate basis of all the events which will have bearing on the performance/operations of the company as well as information which are considered to be price sensitive. As the dispute between its subsidiary and its client had an impact on the consolidated revenue and operationsPage 3 of 5  of NIIT which makes it a price sensitive information, the company was required to make disclosures to the stock exchange immediately on receiving the default notice from its client i.e. on March 13, 2015. However, NIIT is alleged to have informed the stock exchanges about the same only on March 23, 2015 i.e with a delay of 10 days. Therefore, it was alleged that NIIT has violated Clause 36 of the equity listing agreement read with regulation 103(2) of the LODR Regulations. 4. Pending Adjudication Proceedings, the company (applicant) proposed to settle the instant proceedings initiated against it, without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusions of law, through a settlement order and filed a settlement application with SEBI bearing reference number 4209/2020 dated October 05, 2020, in terms of the provisions of SEBI (Settlement Proceedings) Regulations, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as \"Settlement Regulations\").  5.

(hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee no. 3\\\\\\\\u201d), calling upon them to show cause as to why a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees in terms of Section 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992, should not be imposed on Noticee no. 1, 2 and 3 (hereinafter collectively referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018the Noticees\\\\\\\\u2019) for the violation as alleged in the show cause notice dated September 11, 2019 issued by adjudicating officer which led to passing of Adjudication Order dated April 24, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u2018AO Order\\\\\\\\u2019). For further clarity, the relevant contents of the present SCN are reproduced hereunder: \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.  4. It is observed from the above that, the AO has held that the Noticees, on account of delay in meeting MTM obligations, have failed to act with appropriate diligence in violation of Clause A(2) of Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of the Stock Brokers Regulations. The Adjudication Proceedings were disposed of by the AO without imposition of any penalty under Section 15HB of SEBI Act in view of the penalty already been levied by the exchange for contravention of the exchange rules. However, the Section 15HB of the SEBI Act as amended vide Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014 effective from September 08, 2014 stipulates a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees. It is further noted that the aforesaid violation by the Noticees pertains to the investigation period from January 01, 2016 to January 27, 2016 i.e. after the said amendment to the SEBI Act. Thus, Section 15HB of the SEBI Act mandates at least aOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in the matter of Castor Seeds Contract at NCDEX Page 2 of 18  minimum penalty of one lakh rupees on the Noticees once the violation by them has been established under Clause A(2) of Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of the Stock Brokers Regulations.  5. Therefore, after examining the records of the above mentioned adjudication proceedings, SEBI is of the opinion that the Adjudication Order No. Order/MC/DS/2020-21/7516-7518 dated April 24, 2020 is erroneous and it is not in the interest of securities market as no penalty was imposed on the Noticees for violating Clause A(2) of Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of the Stock Brokers Regulations, though the Section 15HB of the SEBI Act as amended vide Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014 stipulates a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees. Thus, the aforesaid AO order is fit for review as under section 15-I (3) of the SEBI Act, 1992.  6. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..  7. In view of the above, the instant Show Cause Notice is being issued under section 15-I(3) of SEBI Act, and  the Noticees are called upon to show cause as to why a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one crore rupees in terms of Section 15HB of the SEBI Act, should not be imposed on the Noticees.    8. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..  2. Show Cause Notice dated September 11, 2019 issued by adjudicating officer came to be issued as SEBI had initiated adjudication proceedings under Section 15HB of SEBI Act, 1992 against the Noticees, who are trading members of NCDEX, for the alleged failure of the Noticees to make the requisite payment of margins and other obligations within the prescribed timelines and they were alleged to have violated the Code of Conduct as specified in clause A(1)  and  (2)  of  Schedule  II  read  with  Regulation  9  of  the  SEBI (Stock  Brokers) Regulations, 1992. Thereafter, the AO Order under Section 15-I (2) of the SEBI Act, 1992 came to be passed wherein the adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticees were disposed of by the adjudicating officer with the following observations:   \\\\\\\\u201c26.  I note from  the  SCN  that  Noticees were alleged  to  have  violated  code  of conduct as specified in clause A(1) and (2) of schedule II read with regulation 9 of the Stock Brokers Regulations on account of failure to deposit the required MTM within the stipulated bank run in violation of Rules 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 of the NCDEX Bye-laws, Rules and Regulations. It was also alleged in the SCN that Noticee No. 1, 2 and 3 were irregular in meeting its MTM obligation on 4 days, 7 days and 14 days respectively during the investigation period.  27 .Noticee No. 1, Noticee No. 2 and Noticee No. 3 in their replies submitted that there were delays on 3 occasions, 7 occasions and 16 occasions in first run in payment  of  MTM.  TheOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in the matter of Castor Seeds Contract at NCDEX Page 3 of 18  said  delays in  meeting  the  MTM  pay-in  obligation  by Noticees on January 27, 2016 occurred under extraordinary circumstances and not due to any negligence or failure to exercise due care and diligence on the part of the Noticees. Further, the Noticees also submitted the correspondence between  Noticee  and  NCDEX  regarding the  delay in meeting MTM  payment obligations.  28. I have  perused  the  submissions  of  the  Noticees and the  correspondence between Noticee and NCDEX on MTM shortfalls. There is nothing on record to contradict the  submissions  of  the  Noticees that in the  said instances,  the shortfall  was  only  on  account  of  delay  in  inter-bank  payments,  and  that  the shortfalls were cleared on the same day in all the instances mentioned, except for the following instances:  a) One instance on January 27, 2016 in case of Noticee No.1 of Rs.6.66 Crores which  remained  unpaid  by  client,  and  position  was  closed  out. Additional capital of Noticee No.1 was used to meet the MTM losses of Rs.15.66 Crores as on January 28, 2016.  b) One  instance  on  January  25,  2016  in  case  of  Noticee  No.2,  where  it requested NCDEX to square up its positions on account of inability by clients to pay MTM losses. I note that the position was closed out and additional  capital  of  Noticee  No.2  was  used  to  meet  MTM  losses of Rs.13.98 Crores. c) In case of Noticee No.3, there is no documented instance of overnight delay. Rs.14.58 Crores was used to meet MTM losses from additional capital on close out of positions.  29.From the above I note that, the Noticees requested for squaring up positions due to the extraordinary circumstances prevailing in the Castor Seed contract, and the fact that positions could not be squared up due to absence of buyers and hitting of circuit filters in the contract. However, I note that all 3 Noticees had sufficient  additional  capital  with  NCDEX  which  was  utilized  to  clear  all  MTM losses upon close out of positions.  30. In view of the above, I find that given the circumstances of extreme price fall in the castor seed contracts, the Noticees were able to meet the MTM and pay-in obligations with  the  help  of  sufficient  balance  maintained  by  them  with  the exchange. Hence, it cannot  be held  that  the  Noticees failed  to maintain  high standards of integrity, promptitude or fairness, and thus the charge of violation of  Clause  A(1)  of  schedule  II  read  with  regulation  9  of  the  Stock  Brokers Regulations is not established.  31. On account of delay in meeting MTM obligations, I find that the Noticees failed to act with appropriate diligence in violation of Clause A(2) of schedule II read with  regulation  9  of  the  Stock  Brokers  Regulations. The  exchange  was  well within its rights to penalize the NoticeesOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in the matter of Castor Seeds Contract at NCDEX Page 4 of 18  for delays which occurred in meeting the MTM obligations, and I note that a penalty of Rs. Ten lakhs each has been levied on all the 3 Noticees by NCEDX for violation of rules 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 of the Exchange Bye-laws, Rules and Regulations and additional penalty of Rs. 5 Lakh was levied on Noticee No. 3, since it had traded in Castor Seeds Contract through  his  proprietary  account. Hence, for  the  same  violation,  the  initial regulator in such situation the exchange i.e. NCDEX has already taken suitable action against the Noticee by imposing penalty as stated above.  32.Asappropriate   penalty   has   already   been   levied   by   the   exchange   for contravention of  the  exchange  rules, further  imposition of  penalty  upon  the Noticees for the same cause of action would not be appropriate. Hence I find that this is not a fit case for imposition of penalty.\\\\\\\\u201d  Personal Hearing, Replies and Submissions:  3. I note that personal hearing for the Noticee no. 1 and 2 was held on September 9, 2020 and for Noticee no. 3 was held on November 11, 2020. Noticee no. 1 has filed its merit based reply dated August 31, 2020 to the SCN, Noticee no. 2 has filed his merit based reply dated September 1, 2020 to the SCN and Noticee no. 3 has filed his merit based reply dated August 31, 2020 to the SCN. Noticee no. 3 has also filed its written submissions dated December 16, 2020.   4. The following is a gist of the contentions raised by the Noticee no. 1 and 2 (their contentions being similar in nature, hence clubbed together) in their replies and in their oral submissions made during the personal hearing:  a. At the outset, it is submitted that the Ld. AO has committed a grave error in arriving at the finding that \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticee on account of delay in meeting MTM obligation has failed to act with appropriate diligence in violation of Clause A (2) of Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of Stock Brokers Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d. The Ld. AO has failed to appreciate that the act of delay in meeting MTM obligations does not amount to lack of diligence within the meaning of Clause A(2) as held by AO, but amounts to promptitude within the ambit of Clause A(1). However, it is submitted that the Ld. AO has categorically stated that there has been no violation of Clause A(1) by the Noticees. In view of the above, it is submitted that if the findings of the AO is examinedOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in the matter of Castor Seeds Contract at NCDEX Page 5 of 18  in depth, it would emerge that  the Ld. AO has erred in holding us liable for violation of Clause A (2).  b. The finding of the AO that \\\\\\\\u201con account of the delay in meeting the MTM obligations, the Noticee failed to act with appropriate diligence\\\\\\\\u201d, is contrary to the Ld. AO\\\\\\\\u2019s own observation in para 27, 28 and 29 of the AO Order. Against this backdrop, the findings of the AO that on account of delay in meeting MTM obligations, the Noticee failed to act with appropriate diligence in violation of Clause A(2), is without any basis and logic.  c. Review of AO Order by SEBI is contemplated if such order is so erroneous that it is not considered by SEBI to be in the interest of securities market. It is submitted that there is no such situation. The alleged violations are of venial nature and could not cause any systemic risk. It is not enough to invoke the power of review if the AO Order is merely erroneous, it has to be erroneous to such extent that it is not in the interest of securities market.  d. It is pertinent to note that a similar order based on similar facts, has been passed by the same AO, on December 23, 2019 in the matter of Leo Commodities Ltd., but SEBI has not found the said order erroneous for the purpose of review under section 15-I(3) of the SEBI Act, 1992. It is not clear as to how and on what basis, the said case has been distinguished from the case of the Noticee.  e. As held by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of Adjudicating Officer, SEBI v. Bhavesh Pabari ((2019) 5 Supreme Court Cases 90), the penal provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 levying minimum and maximum penalty have to be read along with the provisions of section 15-I (2) and section 15 J, which vest discretion in the AO while imposing penalty or determining the quantum of penalty. Hence, it is submitted that, it is not mandatory to impose penalty in all cases, whether venial or technical violations. Further, the mitigating factors as specified in Clause (a), (b) and (c) of section 15J are not exhaustive and in the given facts of the case, the AO may consider other relevant factors also while deciding on penalty. It is submitted that in the instant case, the AO has rightfully considered the penalty imposed by NCDEX as \\\\\\\\u201cthe other relevant factor\\\\\\\\u201d while determining the penalty to be imposed by her.Order under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in the matter of Castor Seeds Contract at NCDEX Page 6 of 18  5. The following is a gist of the contentions raised by the Noticee no. 3 in its reply and in its written submissions and also at the time of personal hearing:  f. The documents asked vide our reply dated August 31, 2020 has not been provided to us by SEBI. The SCN and copy of the AO Order can never be said to be records of the said proceedings, much less its examining thereof for initiation of the present proceedings.  g. The Final Order dated November 14, 2018 by WTM of SEBI exonerated the Noticee with respect to all charges. The appreciation of this fact arising from the final order in the matter of Castor Seed Contracts found to have escaped the attention of learned AO while issuing SCN. Had the Ld. AO appreciated that the Noticee has been exonerated from the charges and allegations with respect to PFUTP Regulations, the question of inquiry to find out possible violation of bye-laws 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 of NCDEX does not arise at all, much less impugned proceedings under section 15-I(3) of SEBI Act, 1992.  h. The fact of Noticee keeping average balance of Rs. 40 Crores with NCDEX and consequent refund by NCDEX after completing all proceedings of Castor Seed Contract, makes it abundantly clear that there was neither a shortfall in MTM nor margin by the Noticee, either on behalf of its client or PRO account. Therefore, the question of violation of Rules, Regulations and Bye-laws of NCDEX, does not arise at all, warranting invoking of section 15HB of SEBI Act, 1992.  i. It is pertinent to note that a similar order based on similar facts, has been passed by the same AO, on December 23, 2019 in the matter of Leo Commodities Ltd., but SEBI has not found the said order erroneous for the purpose of review under section 15-I(3) of the SEBI Act, 1992. It is not clear as to how and on what basis, the said case has been distinguished from the case of the Noticee.  j. On conjoint reading of the Final Order dated November 14, 2018 and August 12, 2020, it is established beyond doubt that trade in Castor Seed had not impacted the safety and integrity of the securities market and the interest of investors. Under such circumstances, the question of inviting and invoking the provisions of section 15-I(3) of SEBI Act, 1992, does not arise at all.Order under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in the matter of Castor Seeds Contract at NCDEX Page 7 of 18  k. The order passed by WTM on August 12, 2020 in the matter of Castor Seeds contracts at NCDEX must be seen as guiding light. In most respectful submission, the opinion formed by SEBI, on the conclusion derived by the Ld. AO as erroneous, is crippled with self-contradiction and therefore it deserves reconsideration on part of SEBI.   Consideration of submissions and findings thereon:   6. Before dealing with the contentions of the Noticees, it would be appropriate to refer to the brief background of the matter which is important for determination of the issue involved in the present proceedings. The background facts of the case are as under:  (i) NCDEX under the provisions of its Rules, Bye-laws and Regulations suspended  the  trading  in  Castor  Seed  Contracts at  the  close  of  business hours,  vide  its circular (NCDEX/TRADING-007/2016/012) dated 27 January, 2016.  Pursuant to the same, SEBI undertook a preliminary examination in respect of trading in Castor Seed Contracts at NCDEX platform for the period January 01, 2016 to January 27, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018investigation period\\\\\\\\u2019).   (ii) Vide ad-interim ex-parte orders dated March 2, 2016 and May 24, 2016, a total of 18 entities (4 Trading Members i.e. Noticee no. 1 to 3 and Leo Global Commodities Pvt. Ltd., and  14  clients)  were restrained from buying, selling or dealing in the securities market, either directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, till further directions.   (iii) It was observed that these 18 entities had large open positions in Castor Seeds Contracts  and  had  repeatedly  expressed  inability  to  collect/deposit  Mark  to Market (MTM) and pay-in obligations. Further, it was also observed that these 18 entities were holding approximately 62.48% of the Open Interest of the February \\\\\\\\u20132016 (contract expiry was on February 19, 2016) contracts which constituted a value of Rs. 540 crores. SEBI, vide  confirmatory  order  dated March 8, 2017, confirmed the restrictions imposedOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in the matter of Castor Seeds Contract at NCDEX Page 8 of 18  by the Interim Orders on 17 entities subject to certain relaxations. The restrictions imposed on 1 entity viz. Narsinpuria Korodimal were revoked.  (iv) The  Noticee No. 1  to  3 were amongst 4  trading  members  of  NCDEX which were restrained vide the interim and confirmatory orders for the trades of their clients in Castor seeds contracts. After conclusion of investigation, SEBI did not find any adverse evidence/ conclusion in respect of violation of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003 against the four trading members and hence the directions imposed vide the interim order and the confirmatory order were revoked against them vide the Final Order dated November 14, 2018. However, in respect of the said four trading members (which also includes the Noticees herein), the investigation had found adverse findings with regard to violation of Clauses A(1) and  A(2)  of Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified in Schedule  II  under  regulation 9 of SEBI (Stock Brokers)  Regulations, 1992  which  warranted Adjudication Proceeding under Chapter VIA of SEBI Act, 1992.   (v) Accordingly, a show cause notice dated September 11, 2019 under Rule 4(1) of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and imposing penalty by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 came to be issued against the Noticees, alleging that the Noticees had allowed a build-up of large debit balance towards the end of January 2016 and had not ensured the timely collection of margins and other obligations from their clients. The allegations were on the basis of summary of the number of days when the Noticees were allegedly irregular in meeting the MTM obligations during the investigation period and the aggregate debit balance of their clients in the ledger of the Noticees on the last day of the investigation period. It was alleged that the Noticees had not performed appropriate due diligence, care and promptitude in the conduct of business. As a result of the Noticees failure to collect and pay MTM obligations, NCDEX was compelled to suspend the trading of Castor Seeds Contracts. Furthermore, at NCDEX, in a given trading day, there are 6 bank runs running from 9:30 AM up  to  5:00  PM  for  deposit  of  required  MTM  margin  with  the  Exchange  by  a trading member.  It was observed that in respect of the Noticees, there were several  instances  of  bank  runs.Order under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in the matter of Castor Seeds Contract at NCDEX Page 9 of 18  Multiple  bank  runs  indicate  inability  of the Noticees to deposit MTM and pay-in obligations of its clients at a specified time during a trading day. It was alleged that Failure to deposit the required MTM by the Noticees within the stipulated bank run amounts to violation   of   Exchange   rules   6.3,   6.4   and   6.5   of   Bye-laws, Rules   and Regulations. In view of the above, the show cause notice dated September 11, 2019 issued by the Adjudicating Officer, alleged that the Noticees have violated Clauses A(1) and  A(2)  of Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified in Schedule  II  under  regulation 9 of SEBI (Stock Brokers)  Regulations, 1992.  (vi) The AO Order while disposing of the show cause notice dated September 11, 2019, did not hold the Noticees guilty of violating Clause  A(1)  of Code of Conduct in Schedule II of regulation  9  of  the  SEBI (Stock  Brokers) Regulations, 1992, giving the following reason \\\\\\\\u201cgiven the circumstances of extreme price fall in the castor seed contracts, the Noticees were able to meet the MTM and pay-in obligations with  the  help  of  sufficient  balance  maintained  by  them  with  the exchange. Hence, it cannot  be held  that  the  Noticees failed  to maintain  high standards of integrity, promptitude or fairness, and thus the charge of violation of  Clause  A(1)  \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026 is not established.\\\\\\\\u201d However, on account of delay in meeting MTM obligations and thereby failing to act with appropriate diligence, I note that AO Order held the Noticees guilty of violating Clause A (2) of Code of Conduct, I also note that the AO Order did not impose any penalty upon the Noticees under section 15HB of SEBI Act, 1992 for the aforesaid violation by holding that \\\\\\\\u201cAs appropriate   penalty   has   already   been   levied   by   the   exchange   for  contravention  of  the  exchange  rules, further  imposition of  penalty  upon  the Noticees for the same cause of action would not be appropriate\\\\\\\\u201d.   (vii) Upon examination of record of the adjudication proceedings, SEBI noticed that while the AO Order has found the Noticees guilty of violating Clause A(2) of Code of Conduct in Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of SEBI (Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992,  however, the AO Order erred in not imposing penalty on the Noticees since pursuant to introduction of minimum penalty under section 15HB of SEBI Act, 1992 (as amended vide the Securities LawsOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in the matter of Castor Seeds Contract at NCDEX Page 10 of 18  (Amendment) Act, 2014, effective from September 8, 2014), the Adjudicating Officer should have imposed the minimum penalties as prescribed under the said provision. On this ground alone, SEBI found the AO Order to be erroneous to the interests of the securities market and thereby issued the present SCN calling upon the Noticees to show cause as to why appropriate penalty under section 15HB of SEBI Act, 1992, which shall not be less than one lac rupees but which may extend upto one crore rupees, should not be imposed against the Noticees.   7. I note that the stock exchange i.e. NCDEX has imposed penalty for violation of rules   6.3,   6.4   and   6.5   of   Bye-laws, Rules and Regulations of NCDEX, on its members i.e. Noticees. However, it was observed by SEBI that there were several instances of Bank run against Noticees on multiple occasions. From conduct of the Noticees, SEBI prima facie observed that Noticees are guilty of failure to exercise due diligence which is in violation of Clauses A(1) and (2) of the Code of Conduct in Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of SEBI (Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992, therefore, the adjudication proceedings were initiated against the Noticees. However, it is observed that AO Order after finding that there is violation of Clause A(2) of Code of Conduct, did not impose penalty on the Noticees, taking into account that NCDEX has already levied penalty on Noticees. After coming to finding that there is violation of Code of Conduct and Section 15HB which provide minimum penalty, AO Order has erroneously not imposed penalty provided under Section 15HB of SEBI Act, 1992.   8. I note that, a proceeding under Section 15-I(3) of SEBI Act, 1992 can be undertaken if an order passed by the adjudicating officer is erroneous to the extent that it is not in the interests of securities market. In the instant case, the SCN has alleged the erroneous appreciation of law by the AO Order, whereby the adjudicating officer has allegedly failed to appreciate the mandatory and stringent nature of the provision of section 15HB of SEBI Act, 1992 which stipulated a compulsory minimum penalty when a violation has been established. To this, Noticee no. 1 and 2, by placing reliance on the judgement of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of Adjudicating Officer, SEBI v. Bhavesh Pabari ((2019) 5 SCC 90), have contended that the penal provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 levying minimum andOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in the matter of Castor Seeds Contract at NCDEX Page 11 of 18  maximum penalty have to be read along with the provisions of section 15-I (2) and section 15 J, which vest discretion in the AO while imposing penalty or determining the quantum of penalty. Hence, it is submitted by Noticee no. 1 and 2 that, it is not mandatory to impose penalty in all cases, whether venial or technical violations. Further according to the said Noticees, the mitigating factors as specified in Clause (a), (b) and (c) of section 15J are not exhaustive and in the given facts of the case, the AO may consider other relevant factors also while deciding on penalty. It is contended by them that in the instant case, the AO has rightfully considered the penalty imposed by NCDEX as \\\\\\\\u201cthe other relevant factor\\\\\\\\u201d while determining the penalty to be imposed by her.   9. I note that Section 15I (2) of the SEBI Act, 1992 provides that adjudicating officer may impose such penalty as he thinks fit in accordance with the penalty provisions. However, the question to be determined in present proceedings is whether in exercising his discretion under Section 15I(2) and 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992, adjudicating officer can impose a penalty which is less than the minimum penalty prescribed under the penalty provisions. As per the contention of the Noticee no. 1 and 2, adjudicating officer can do so, in view of the order passed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the Bhavesh Pabari case (supra). I have perused the said judgment. Firstly, I find that Bhavesh Pabari matter dealt with the applicability of Section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992 to the penalty provisions, as existed before the amendments made in the penalty provisions in the year 2014. However, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Court also made following observations regarding penalty provisions as amended in the year 2014, as follows:  \\\\\\\\u201c7.\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.We would prefer read and interpret Section 15\\\\\\\\xadA(a) as it was between 25th October, 2002 and 7th September, 2014 in line with the Amendment Act 27 of 2014 as giving discretion to the Adjudicating Officer to impose minimum penalty of Rs.1 lakh subject to maximum penalty of Rs.1 crore, keeping in view the period of default as well as aggravating and mitigating circumstances including those specified in Section 15\\\\\\\\xadJ of the SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d  It is important to note here that in the Bhavesh Pabari case (supra) a bench of three Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Judges of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court was dealing with a reference made by a bench of two Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble judges of Supreme Court in the matter of SiddharthOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in the matter of Castor Seeds Contract at NCDEX Page 12 of 18  Chaturvedi vs SEBI (2016) 12 SCC 119 regarding the correctness of the judgment of a bench of two Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Judges in the matter of Chairman, SEBI vs Roofit Industries Ltd. (2016) 12 SCC 125 wherein it was held that Section 15J was not available to the adjudicating officer during the period from 2002 (when the penalty provisions were first amended) to 2014 (when the penalty provisions were again amended) and the adjudicating officer is bound to impose monetary penalty as provided under the respective penalty provisions. In this context, the judgment in Bhavesh Pabari case (supra), after taking into account inter alia insertion of Explanation in Section 15J by the Finance Act, 2017, held that adjudicating officer can exercise its discretion between the minimum penalty and maximum penalty taking into consideration Section 15J while imposing penalty under the provisions, as amended by the amendments made in the year, 2002. Secondly, I find that Bhavesh Pabari\\\\\\\\u2019s judgment was rendered on the penalty provisions as they existed after amendments made in the year 2002. Subsequently, these penalty provisions were again amended in the year 2014 and in the present case Section 15HB, as amended by the amendments made in the year 2014, is applicable. I note that there is remarkable difference in the penalty provisions, as they existed after the amendments made in the year 2002 and as they exist after the amendments made in the year 2014. Penalty provisions after the amendments made in the year 2014 introduces minimum penalties that too with the use of the words \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. shall be liable to penalty which shall not be less than\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d which per se indicates the legislative intent that the provisions are mandatory. The penalty provisions, as amended by the 2014 amendments, were not under consideration before Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the Bhavesh Pabari case (supra). Thus, interpretation of the penalty provisions, as amended in the year 2014, as sought to be canvassed by the Noticee no. 1 and 2 on the basis of the Bhavesh Pabari case (supra) is not correct.   10. Now the question arises is whether imposition of minimum penalty is mandatory. In this regard, as observed above, penalty provisions after the amendments made in the year 2014 use the words \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. shall be liable to penalty which shall not be less than\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201d which per se indicates the legislative intent that the provisions are mandatory. In this regard, it would be apposite to refer to the judgment of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in Union of India & Others Vs. A. K. Pandey (2009) 10 SCC 552 wherein it was held as under:Order under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in the matter of Castor Seeds Contract at NCDEX Page 13 of 18   \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.22. The principle seems to be fairly well settled that prohibitive or negative words are ordinarily indicative of mandatory nature of the provision; although not conclusive. The Court has to examine carefully the purpose of such provision and the consequences that may follow from non-observance thereof.

Ashok Kumar and U.S.S. Srivastava are the directors of the Noticee. 2. SEBI started receiving a substantial number of complaints from the clients of the Noticee regarding \\\\\\\\u201cnon-receipt/delay in payment of funds and securities\\\\\\\\u201d from December 2014 onwards. In view of the same, information pertaining to the delay in making payments to the clients as alleged in the complaints was sought from their director Ashok Kumar in terms of section 11(2)(i) of the SEBI Act, 1992 (SEBI Act).   _______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Kassa Finvest Private Limited               Page 2 of 30  3.  Ashok Kumar vide letter dated January 20, 2015 inter-alia submitted the following  i. The shares of clients were sold from the pool account and the sale proceeds were credited to Kassa's account and were used to fill the gap between revenue and expenses. ii. The approximate value of default is Rupees 30 crores and the same shall be settled in instalments starting January 31, 2015.  A post-dated cheque of Rupees 4 crores would be submitted with NSE on January 21, 2015 to be honored on January 31, 2015. iii. Subsequently, every 10 days, cheques of Rupees 4 crores shall be submitted to NSE till the claims are met. 4. However, despite the assurances given by Ashok Kumar, the Noticee failed to resolve investor complaints pending against it within the timeline that was indicated.  NSE vide its e-mail dated March 11, 2015, informed SEBI that there were 195 pending investor complaints against the Noticee having a claim value of approximately Rupees 38.13 crores as of March 11, 2015. 5. Mr.  Ashok Kumar in his submissions made on January 20, 2015, has admitted that Kassa had raised funds by illegally selling the securities of its clients/investors and such funds were purportedly used for meeting Kassa's operational expansion. It was therefore prima facie observed by SEBI that the Noticee had failed to segregate its own and clients' funds and securities as required under SEBI Circular SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993 and MRD/DoP/SE/Cir-11/2008 dated  April  17,  2008  and  Clause  15  of  Rights  and  Obligations documents  for  Stock  Broker,  Sub-brokers  and  Clients  as  prescribed  by  SEBI  vide  its  circular dated August 22, 2011.   _______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Kassa Finvest Private Limited               Page 3 of 30  6. It was also prima facie noted that the Noticee had failed to comply with Clause 12 of SEBI circular no. MIRSD/SE/Cir-19/2009 dated December 03, 2009  and  Clause 33  of  Rights  and  Obligations  document  for  Stock  Brokers,  Sub-Brokers  and Clients as prescribed by SEBI vide its circular dated August 22, 2011, regarding the timelines for settlement of funds. 7. It was further noted during the preliminary examination that the Noticee had issued letters which prima facie suggest that it has provided assured returns to its clients in violation of the provisions of 12 A (a) (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act and regulations 3(b), (c) and (d) and regulations 4(1) and 4(2) (k) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003(PFUTP Regulations). 8. In view of the above prima facie violations that were observed, an Investigation was ordered under Section 11C of the SEBI Act vide order dated February 23, 2015. However, pending investigation, given the serious nature of the alleged violations, SEBI in the interest of protecting the investors in the securities market, in exercise of powers under sections 11(1), 11(4), 11B and 11D of the SEBI Act, 1992, by way of an Ex-Parte -Ad-Interim Order dated March 19, 2015 issued the following directions, - \\\\\\\\u201c i. Kassa   Finvest Private Limited (CIN:U74899DL1994PTC060668)and its directors namely, Mr.Ashok   Kumar (DIN:00405986;   PAN   No.   AAFPK7362N), Dr. Umashankar   Sharan Shrivastav (DIN: 00413213; PAN   No.   AGKPS7923C) and promoter Mrs. Anjana Kumar (PAN not available) are restrained from accessing the securities market and further prohibit them from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities, either  directly  or  indirectly, or  being  associated  with  the  securities  market  in any manner whatsoever, with immediate effect, till further directions;   _______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Kassa Finvest Private Limited               Page 4 of 30  ii. The aforesaid entities and persons shall cease and desist from undertaking any activity in the securities market, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever till further directions; iii. The aforesaid entities and persons are directed to provide a full inventory of all their assets whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets, including details of their all bank and demat accounts immediately but not later than 5 working days from the date of receipt of these directions iv. The aforesaid entities and persons are directed to not to dispose off or alienate any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets except with the prior permission of SEBI.\\\\\\\\u201d 9. Thereafter, SEBI vide order dated September 05, 2017, confirmed the findings in the said interim order and inter alia prohibited the Noticee and its directors from accessing the securities market and further prohibited them from buying, selling or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly or being associated with the securities market in any manner whatsoever, for a period of ten years. 10. The Noticee preferred an appeal (Appeal No. 346 of 2017) against the said SEBI order before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSAT\\\\\\\\u201d). SAT vide common order dated September 26, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSAT Order\\\\\\\\u201d) upheld the findings in the SEBI order on merits. 11. Simultaneously with the aforesaid proceedings, SEBI initiated enquiry proceedings against the Noticee under Chapter V of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 (\"Intermediaries Regulations\") and appointed a Designated Authority (\"DA\") to enquire into whether the alleged violations by the Noticee warranted cancellation or suspension of the certificate of registrations granted by SEBI or any other action provided in Chapter V of the Intermediaries Regulation. On completion of the proceedings, the DA submitted   _______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Kassa Finvest Private Limited               Page 5 of 30  the report dated June 01, 2018 (DA\\\\\\\\u2019s Report) recommending that the certificates of registration of the Noticee be cancelled.  12. Pursuant to this, a post enquiry SCN dated June 19, 2018 was issued to the Noticee under Regulation 28 (1) of SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 to show cause as to why action, as recommended by the DA or any other action as considered appropriate by the Designated Member, should not be taken against the Noticee.  A copy of the DA\\\\\\\\u2019s Report was also forwarded to the Noticee along with an advice to file reply, if any, within 21 days from the date of receipt of the notice.  However, the SCN came back undelivered and the same could also not be served by way affixture at the address of the Noticee available with SEBI. The SCN was therefore uploaded on the SEBI website under >Enforcement>Unserved Summons/Notices.  13. Thereafter, Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing on August 20, 2020. The notice of issue of the post enquiry SCN and the hearing notice was served via newspaper publication in one English newspaper having nationwide circulation, and in the Mumbai and New Delhi editions of one Hindi newspaper. However, Noticee failed to appear for the hearing. Thereafter, another opportunity of hearing was granted to the Noticee on September 24, 2020 wherein also the Noticee failed to enter appearance.  I am, therefore, satisfied that sufficient opportunities have been provided to the Noticee and the principles of natural justice have been complied with in this regard. In view of the above, I am compelled to proceed with the present matter ex-parte based on the material available on record. CONSIDERATION  14. I have considered the Investigation Report, Report submitted by the DA, the Post-Enquiry SCN issued to the Noticee along with the documents contained therein and other material   _______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Kassa Finvest Private Limited               Page 6 of 30  available on record. I note from the records that the modus operandi alleged to have been adopted by the Noticee is as under,-     **related entities i. Kassa Holdings and Consultants Private Limited ii. Kassa Financial Advisors Pvt. Ltd. iii. Mystic Cures Ltd. iv. Mr. Siddharth Shankar(Son of Ashok Kumar) v. Ms. Neetika Shankar. (wife of Siddharth Shankar)  15. It was alleged that the Noticee promised clients fixed/assured returns for securities and funds (money) provided by the clients. The securities received from clients were sold/pledged by the Noticee. The funds received from clients and the proceeds from pledging client securities were then transferred to the bank accounts of the Noticee. Such funds were also transferred to other related entities of the Noticee and used for meeting the business expenses of the Noticee. Siphoning off of the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 funds and securities resulted in liquidity problems and this led to the Noticee defaulting in returning the funds and securities payable to the clients.   _______________________________________________________________________________________ Order in the matter of Kassa Finvest Private Limited               Page 7 of 30  16. I therefore the note that the issues that arise for consideration in the present matter are,- a. Non segregation of own and clients' funds and securities and Mis- utilisation of clients funds/securities b. Indulging in activities other than stock broking business such as providing assured returns to clients/ investors c. Dealing in Cash d. Non-redressal of investor grievance and failure to follow the directions of the Orders of IGRP e. Non-compliance of the requirement of periodical settlement of client accounts and failure to return securities on clients\\\\\\\\u2019 request f. Failure to furnish information related to the broker\\\\\\\\u2019s financial ledgers, demat accounts/statements, details of all bank accounts etc. g. Failure to comply with various provisions of the Broker Regulations and applicable circulars/rules. 17. Before moving forward, it will be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of the SCRR, SEBI Act, Broker Regulations, PMS Regulations, and other SEBI circulars alleged to have been violated by the Noticee.

Summary of submissions \\\\\\\\nThe insurer submitted that its system was erroneously recording the \"quote \\\\\\\\ncreation date\" as the risk inception date for certain policies where the premium \\\\\\\\nwas paid through cheque. \\\\\\\\nPage 2 of 6\\\\\\\\nRegarding delay in remittance of premium by the MISP, the insurer has stated \\\\\\\\nthat the MISP received the cheque dated 15th May, 2018 on 1 ylh May, 2018. The \\\\\\\\nquote was generated on 1 yth May, 2018. The customer has requested to update \\\\\\\\nthe address on the same date but it could not be done due to technical issue. \\\\\\\\nThe issue was resolved on 24th May, 2018. The policy was issued on 24th May, \\\\\\\\n2018 with the risk inception date of 1ylh May, 2018. \\\\\\\\nThe insurer has also submitted that they have rectified the system errors \\\\\\\\nsubsequently in the month of December, 2018. \\\\\\\\n7. Decision on charge no.1 \\\\\\\\nThe insurer has stated that the quote creation date has been captured in its \\\\\\\\nsystem as policy inception date due to system error and the system error was \\\\\\\\nrectified subsequently. The explanation for the policy in the second table is \\\\\\\\nacceptable. However, it is observed from the policy copies submitted by the \\\\\\\\ninsurer that for the sample policies in the first table in question, the policy start \\\\\\\\ndates are the same as mentioned in above table. In case of all the 5 policies \\\\\\\\nmentioned in the table, risk inception date is shown as prior to the date recorded \\\\\\\\non the face of the cheque. The insurer has not provided any evidence to show \\\\\\\\nthat the errors in the system have been rectified or the risk inception date has \\\\\\\\nbeen modified through any endorsement to the policyholder. The insurer has \\\\\\\\nallowed these policies to run erroneously and in effect, this demonstrates lack of \\\\\\\\nsufficient control functions. \\\\\\\\nIn respect of delay in remittance of premium by the MISP, insurer's submission \\\\\\\\nhas been noted. The insurer is hereby advised to ensure compliance of Para 6 of \\\\\\\\nchapter V of MISPG scrupulously. \\\\\\\\nIn view of the violations observed in the above five instances in respect of Para 6 \\\\\\\\nof corporate governance guidelines, the Authority in exercise of the powers \\\\\\\\nvested under Section 102(b) of the Insurance Act, 1938 imposes a penalty of \\\\\\\\nRs. 5 lakh (Rupees Five Lakh Only). \\\\\\\\n8. Charge no.2 \\\\\\\\nViolation of Para 23 of IRDA (Registration of Indian Insurance Companies) \\\\\\\\nRegulations, 2000; Para 16 of IRDAI (Insurance Surveyors and Loss \\\\\\\\nAssessors) Regulations, 2015 and Para 14(d) of MISP guidelines - The \\\\\\\\ninsurer is using clauses/ terms in Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) related to \\\\\\\\nprocessing of motor insurance claims which are against the interest of \\\\\\\\npolicyholders. Also, the insurer has not sent initial assessment of loss or final \\\\\\\\nsettlement letter to the policyholder. \\\\\\\\nPage 3 of 6\\\\\\\\nThe following clauses/ terms of standard operating procedure (SOP) of claims \\\\\\\\nsettlement have been found to be detrimental to the interests of the \\\\\\\\npolicyholders: \\\\\\\\n1. lncentivization and dis-incentivization of the surveyor is based on the amount \\\\\\\\nnegotiated by the surveyor over or below the Vehicle Repair Order (VRO) -\\\\\\\\nbenchmark given by claim analyst. \\\\\\\\nii. The insurer is allowing claim amount without taxes (i.e. 80% of the liability), if \\\\\\\\nthe customer chooses to get his damaged vehicle repaired at the garage of \\\\\\\\nhis/ her choice. A window of 15 days is provided to the customer to get the \\\\\\\\nvehicle repaired and submit final repair bill. In case of no response, a reminder \\\\\\\\nis sent with a notice to cancel the OD section of the policy without refund. \\\\\\\\nAlso, in three sample cases it is noted that the insurer is not sending \\\\\\\\ncommunication regarding initial assessment of claims and final payment amount \\\\\\\\nto the customer and the sms sent is about confirmation of receipt of claim and \\\\\\\\nself-survey of the vehicle. Further, the insurer is not giving final settlement letter \\\\\\\\nto the policyholder at the time of settlement of claim. \\\\\\\\n9. Summary of submissions \\\\\\\\nRegarding linking of incentive or disincentive of the surveyor, the insurer has \\\\\\\\nsubmitted that the clause suggested in the SOP was such that the customer's \\\\\\\\ninterest is not jeopardized and the negotiation is between the garage and the \\\\\\\\ninsurance company. The insurer has further submitted that the clause was never \\\\\\\\nused. \\\\\\\\nRegarding the practice of allowing claim amount without taxes, the insurer has \\\\\\\\nreplied that the payment of . claim liability prior to conducting repair of the \\\\\\\\ndamaged vehicle is an option which customer can exercise for direct settlement \\\\\\\\nof claim before actual repair is carried out. In order to close the incident/ event of \\\\\\\\nclaim and avoid any malpractices, the insurer requires the customer to submit the \\\\\\\\nfinal invoice of repair. \\\\\\\\nThe insurer has further submitted that both the above clauses have been \\\\\\\\nremoved from the SOP in the month of October, 2019. \\\\\\\\nRegarding the observation on sending claim related communication to the \\\\\\\\ncustomer, the insurer has stated that they provide regular updates to the \\\\\\\\ncustomers regarding claim at each and every stage in the claims journey. The \\\\\\\\ninsurer has submitted screenshots of communication sent by them to the \\\\\\\\npolicyholders electronically. \\\\\\\\nPage 4 of 6\\\\\\\\n10. Decision on charge no.2 \\\\\\\\nPayment of incentive to the surveyor based on the agreed amount negotiated \\\\\\\\nwith the claimant is liable to create a bias in the judgment of the surveyor. The \\\\\\\\nsurveyor may tend to assess losses for a lesser amount as compared to the \\\\\\\\nactual damages to earn higher incentive. The surveyor who is supposed to be \\\\\\\\nthe expert in the subject is expected to provide the estimate of losses accurately \\\\\\\\nand professionally and not based on the incentives provided by the insurer. \\\\\\\\nAlso, a clause restricting the claim amount to 80% when the customer is getting \\\\\\\\nhis/ her vehicle repaired at a garage other than authorized by the insurer is \\\\\\\\nrestrictive on the choices offered to the policyholders as at the time of claim the \\\\\\\\npolicyholder will be pressured into accepting it. \\\\\\\\nHowever, taking on record the submission made by the insurer that till date the \\\\\\\\ninsurer has not exercised these clauses and in October, 2019, the said clauses \\\\\\\\nhave been removed from its SOP and also considering the screenshots \\\\\\\\nsubmitted by the insurer in respect of communications sent to the policyholders, \\\\\\\\nthe insurer is hereby advised to refrain from incorporating any clause (s) which \\\\\\\\nare potentially detrimental to the interest of the policyholders. Also, the insurer is \\\\\\\\nadvised to adhere to Para 14(d) of the MISPG. \\\\\\\\n11. Summary of Decisions: \\\\\\\\nCharge \\\\\\\\nViolation of Provisions \\\\\\\\nNo. \\\\\\\\n1 \\\\\\\\nViolation of Para 6 of corporate governance \\\\\\\\nguidelines \\\\\\\\nThe insurer has failed to \\\\\\\\nensure that the risk is assumed after the \\\\\\\\nreceipt of premium and the MISP deposits \\\\\\\\nthe premium within twenty four hours of its \\\\\\\\ncollection \\\\\\\\n2 \\\\\\\\nViolation of Para 23 of IRDA (Registration \\\\\\\\nof \\\\\\\\nIndian \\\\\\\\nInsurance \\\\\\\\nCompanies) \\\\\\\\nRegulations, 2000; Regulation 16 of IRDAI \\\\\\\\n(Insurance Surveyors and Loss Assessors) \\\\\\\\nRegulations, 2015 and Para 14(d) of MISP \\\\\\\\nterms in Standard Operating Procedure \\\\\\\\n(SOP) related to processing of motor \\\\\\\\ninsurance claims which are against the \\\\\\\\ninterest of policyholders. Also, the insurer \\\\\\\\nhas not sent initial assessment of loss or \\\\\\\\nfinal settlement letter to the policyholder. \\\\\\\\nDecision \\\\\\\\nRs. Five Lakh penalty \\\\\\\\nand Advisory \\\\\\\\nAdvisory \\\\\\\\nPage 5 of 6\\\\\\\\n12. The penalty amount of Rs. 5 lakh (Rupees Five lakh only) shall be remitted by \\\\\\\\nthe insurer by debiting the shareholders' account within a period of forty five days \\\\\\\\nfrom the date of receipt of this order through NEFT/RTGS (details for which will \\\\\\\\nbe communicated separately). An intimation of remittance may be sent to Mrs. \\\\\\\\nYegnapriya Bharath, Chief General Manager (Non-Life) at the Insurance \\\\\\\\nRegulatory and Development Authority of India, Survey No.115/1, Financial \\\\\\\\nDistrict, Nanakramguda, Hyderabad 500032, email id - ypriyab@irda.gov.in. \\\\\\\\n13. Further, the Order shall be placed before the Board of the insurer in the \\\\\\\\nupcoming Board Meeting and the insurer shall provide a copy of the minutes of \\\\\\\\nthe discussion. \\\\\\\\n14.

BIS\\\\\\\\nalleged that Avnet Asia employees illegally exported various electronic components, controlled under\\\\\\\\nthe Export Administration Regulations (EAR), through Singapore to China and Iran, including to a\\\\\\\\ncompany on the BIS Entity List.\\\\\\\\nConcurrently, the Department of Justice announced the unsealing of an indictment today charging\\\\\\\\nCheng Bo, also known as Joe Cheng, a 45-year-old national of the People\\\\\\\\u2019s Republic of China, with\\\\\\\\nparticipating in a criminal conspiracy from 2012-2015 to violate U.S. export laws by shipping U.S. power\\\\\\\\namplifiers to China. Additionally, Cheng\\\\\\\\u2019s former employer, Avnet Asia, agreed to pay a financial penalty\\\\\\\\nto the United States of $1,508,000 to settle criminal liability for the conduct of its former employees,\\\\\\\\nincluding Cheng. As part of a Non-Prosecution Agreement, Avnet Asia admitted responsibility for\\\\\\\\nCheng\\\\\\\\u2019s unlawful conspiracy to ship export controlled U.S. goods with potential military applications to\\\\\\\\nChina, and also for the criminal conduct of another former employee who, from 2007-2009, illegally\\\\\\\\ncaused U.S. goods to be shipped to China and Iran without a license.

Most of these items,\\\\\\\\nclassified under Export Control Classification Number 3A001, are subject to export controls for National\\\\\\\\nSecurity and Anti-Terrorism reasons and are prohibited from export to Iran and China without the\\\\\\\\nrequisite government authorization.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) observed large scale reversal of trades in the Stock Options segment of BSE leading to creation of artificial volume. Pursuant to the same, SEBI initiated an investigation into the trading activities of certain entities in the illiquid stock options at BSE for the period April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015. During the course of investigations, it was observed that the entities were reversing its buy or sell positions in a contract with subsequent sell or buy positions with the same counterparty during the same day and therefore, it is alleged that the reversal of trades were considered as non-genuine trades and also resulted in artificial volumes in the contracts traded at BSE.   2. It is observed from the analysis of the trade log of Aarti Sponge and Power Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) during the aforementioned period that the Noticee had traded in 87 unique contracts in the Stock options segment of BSE during the relevant period, in which it has allegedly entered into non--genuine trades in 77 contracts wherein it executed a total of 197 trades all of which were allegedly non- genuine trades. In view of the same, it was alleged that the abovementioned trades of the Noticee had resulted into creation of artificial volume of total 4,22,85,988 units in the given 77 contracts. It was further alleged that the Noticee, by executing non- genuine trades during the relevant period, registered a positive close out difference of Rs. 6,69,96,536. This, allegedly resulted in the violation of regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and UnfairPage 2 of 3  Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). In view of above, SEBI had initiated adjudication proceedings against the Noticee under section 15HA of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI Act\\\\\\\\u2019).  3. Vide communique dated May 29, 2018, the undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter.

SEBI/HO/EAD/23143/2018 dated August 14, 2018 was issued to the Noticee, calling upon it to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against it in terms of Rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules and penalty be not imposed under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act for the aforementioned alleged violations of the PFUTP Regulations committed by Noticee.

Meanwhile, SEBI decided to introduce a Settlement Scheme (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cScheme\\\\\\\\u201d) in terms of Regulation 26 of the Settlement Regulations.  5. Regulation 26 of the Settlement Regulations reads as under:  Settlement Schemes.  26. Notwithstanding anything contained in these regulations, the Board may specify the procedure and terms of settlement of specified proceedings under a settlement scheme for any class of persons involved in respect of any similar specified defaults.   Explanation. - A settlement order issued under a Settlement scheme shall be deemed to be a settlement order under these regulations  6. Accordingly, SEBI framed the Scheme in accordance with the provisions of the Settlement Regulations which provided a onetime opportunity to the entities againstPage 3 of 3  whom adjudication proceedings were approved for the above mentioned violations, to settle the said pending proceedings.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) had conducted investigation into the alleged generation of bogus long term capital gains in the scrip of Voltaire Leasing and Finance Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cVLFL/ company\\\\\\\\u201d) through stock exchange mechanism during the period August 12, 2014 to July 31, 2015. During the course of investigation, summons was issued under section 11C(2) read with 11C(3) of the Securities And Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) to Goldensight Traders Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee\\\\\\\\u201d) for production of certain details/ information pertaining to the off-market transactions done by it in the scrip of VLFL. It is alleged that the Noticee failed to comply with the summons and therefore adjudication proceedings under section 15A(a) of SEBI Act was initiated in respect of the Noticee.In the matter of Voltaire Leasing and Finance Limited Page 2 of 4  APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  2. The Competent Authority of SEBI, vide communique dated March 12, 2020 appointed Dr. Anitha Anoop as the Adjudicating Officer to conduct the adjudication proceedings in the manner specified under Rule 4 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) and impose such penalty, as deemed  fit, in terms of Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules and Section 15A(a) of the SEBI Act. Pursuant to the transfer of Dr. Anitha Anoop, the undersigned has been appointed as the Adjudicating Officer in the matter, vide communique dated November 3, 2020.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING  3. The Show Cause Notice ref. SEBI/EAD/AA/MKG/13144/2020 dated August 11, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee through digitally signed email and also through hand delivery/affixture through SEBI, Eastern Regional Office. However, the SCN could neither be hand delivered nor could be affixed at the last known address of the Noticee  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES 4. During the course of the current proceedings, the status of the Noticee was ascertained from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) website. It was observed that the name of the Noticee has been struck off from the list of companies by the Registrar of Companies, Mumbai (RoC) as on August 24, 2018. As per the Notice of Striking Off and Dissolution list (Form No. STK-7) dated August 24, 2018, which was downloaded from the MCA website, a list of 7145 companies was attached as per the Notification issued by ROC, Kolkata in terms of sub-section (5) of section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013 and rule 9 of the Companies (Removal of Names of Companies from the Register of Companies) Rules, 2016. I find that the name of the Noticee was mentioned in the said list (at sl.no. 2025 under CIN No U51900WB2014PTC199340).In the matter of Voltaire Leasing and Finance Limited Page 3 of 4  5. The Notification downloaded from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA),  Government of India, (www.mca.gov.in) website inter alia, mentioned the following: \\\\\\\\u201cThis is with respect to this Office\\\\\\\\u2019s Notice No. ROCWB/S-248/2018 even dated and Notice in form STK 5 No. ROC/WB/STK-5/2018/1 issued on dated 29.06.2018. Notice is hereby published that pursuant to sub-section (5) of Section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013 the names of 7145 no. of Companies as per list attached as Annexure \\\\\\\\u201cA\\\\\\\\u201d have this day i.e. 24th day of August, 2018 been struck off the register of companies and the said Company are dissolved.\\\\\\\\u201d 6. In the instant matter, I find that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been struck off from the list of RoC records and also dissolved even before the date of issuance of SCN. It is an established fact that when a company\\\\\\\\u2019s name is struck-off from the RoC list and the company is also dissolved, then it is a non-existing company and the adjudication proceedings against the non-existing company is thus nullity. In this context, I would like to draw reference to a judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) vs Vived Marketing Services (P) Ltd., ITA NO. 273/2009 dated September 17, 2009 in which it was held that - \\\\\\\\u201cWhen the Assessing Officer passed the order of assessment against the respondent company, it had already been dissolved and struck off the register of the Registrar of companies under Section 560 of the Companies Act. In these circumstances, the Tribunal rightly held that there could not have been any assessment order passed against the company which was not in existence as on that date in the eyes of law it had already been dissolved. We are of the opinion that the view taken by the Tribunal is perfectly valid and in accordance with law.\\\\\\\\u201d   7. Further, Black\\\\\\\\u2019s Law Dictionary explains \\\\\\\\u2018dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 as termination or winding up. It further clarifies that the dissolution of a corporation is the termination of its legal existence. Strike off essentially means removing the name of the company from the Register maintained by the Registrar of Companies. It is like closure of the company and the company will not be in existence after being struck- off and cannot perform any operations.In the matter of Voltaire Leasing and Finance Limited Page 4 of 4   8. Therefore, in view of the facts and circumstances noted in the preceding paragraphs and also the fact that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been struck-off from the RoC list and also \\\\\\\\u2018dissolved\\\\\\\\u2019 as on August 24, 2018 as per the RoC notification, I conclude that the present adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee cannot be proceeded with.  ORDER  9. In view of the above observations/findings and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against the Noticee viz. Goldensight Traders Private Ltd.  10.

Various judgments have ben relied upon to buttress the said submissions, like: Painter Vs. Liverpool Oil Gas Light Co. [(1836) 3 A & E 433]; A. R. Antulay Vs. R.S. Nayak [(1988) 2 SCC 602]; Canara Bank and Ors. Vs. Debasis Das and Ors. [Appeal (Civil) 7539 of 1999]; Sterlite Industries (India) Limited Vs. SEBI [(2001) 34 SCL 485 (SAT)].  ii. If services of investment advisory are not allowed to be provided to the ongoing clients, they will shift to some other IA and the business of the Noticee will completely stop.  iii. The directions of restraining from providing the services to the clients is ultra vires to the Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution of India.  iv. As the Noticee is a registered intermediary under the IA Regulations, the direction for restraining him ought to have been passed in compliance with the due process laid down under the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 and not by an interim order. Order in the matter of M/s Tradebizz Research (Proprietor, Mr. Santosh Singh Parihar) Page 4 of 26    v. The direction for restraining the Noticee from alienating his assets is against the Section 11 (4) (e) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \"the SEBI Act\"). A permission from Judicial Magistrate First Class should have been taken before issuance of such directions.  vi. No complaint except one from any of the investors of the Noticee is pending. The said pending complaint was not resolved as the Noticee was restrained from accessing his bank accounts or to provide service of investment advisory to the said client/complainant.  8. I have perused the findings recorded in the interim order, the submissions advanced on behalf of the Noticee and the other materials available on record. In my view, the limited issue that needs to be adjudged in the present proceedings is whether the Noticee, while acting as an Investment Adviser, has violated the provisions of securities law as alleged vide the interim order? 9. Before adverting to the factual conspectus of the case, I note that the Noticee has been alleged to have violated various provisions of the PFUTP Regulations and the IA Regulations. Therefore, it becomes imperative to first have a look on the said provisions, which are reproduced hereunder for ready reference:   PFUTP Regulations 2 (1) In these regulations, unless the context otherwise requires,\\\\\\\\u2014 (c). \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d includes any act, expression, omission or concealment committed whether in a deceitful manner or not by a person or by any other person with his connivance or by his agent while dealing in securities in order to induce another person or his agent to deal in securities, whether or not there is any wrongful gain or avoidance of any loss, and shall also include\\\\\\\\u2014 (1) a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of material fact in order that another person may act to his detriment; (2) a suggestion as to a fact which is not true by one who does not believe it to be true; \\\\\\\\u2026 (8) a false statement made without reasonable ground for believing it to be true; \\\\\\\\u2026 And \\\\\\\\u201cfraudulent\\\\\\\\u201d shall be construed accordingly; Order in the matter of M/s Tradebizz Research (Proprietor, Mr. Santosh Singh Parihar) Page 5 of 26    4 (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a manipulative, fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities markets. 4(2) (k): an advertisement that is misleading or that contains information in a distorted manner and which may influence the decision of the investors. IA Regulations 15 (1) An investment adviser shall act in a fiduciary capacity towards its clients and shall disclose all conflicts of interests as and when they arise. \\\\\\\\u2026 (8) An investment adviser shall abide by Code of Conduct as specified in Third Schedule. Code of Conduct 1. Honesty and fairness An investment adviser shall act honestly, fairly and in the best interests of its clients and in the integrity of the market. 2.

Fair and reasonable charges An investment adviser advising a client may charge fees, subject to any ceiling as may be specified by the Board, if any. The investment adviser shall ensure that fees charged to the clients is fair and reasonable. 17. Investment adviser shall ensure that,- Order in the matter of M/s Tradebizz Research (Proprietor, Mr. Santosh Singh Parihar) Page 6 of 26    (a) All investments on which investment advice is provided is appropriate to the risk profile of the client; (b) It has a documented process for selecting investments based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment objectives and financial situation;  10.  I observe that though the interim order makes various insinuations against the Noticee which are in fact arising out of the specific complaints of the investors who had availed the services against consideration paid to the Noticee, however, the Noticee, through its submissions in the present proceedings, has summarily brushed aside those allegations/findings by claiming that all complaints of the investors (except one) have been resolved by him. It is noted that the Noticee is not only facing allegation of non-compliance with provisions of IA Regulations, but is also confronted with the violation of the provisions of PFUTP Regulations. Having gone through the written as well as oral submissions advanced by the Noticee, it is noted that the submissions majorly revolve around two grounds: one, there has been violation of principles of natural justice and two, the interim order is in contravention of Article of 19 (1) (g) of Constitution of India. I shall now discuss the said contentions of the Noticee as raised in the present proceedings.  11. I note that the Noticee has made a submission that he was not even asked for any explanation nor any opportunity of personal hearing was afforded to him before passing the above mentioned interim order and the same has been termed to be in violation of principles of natural justice. In this connection, it is noted that the power to issue interim directions flows from Section 11 (4) of the SEBI Act, 1992. A plain reading of the said section indicates that either pending investigation or inquiry, SEBI may take various actions as listed out under the said Section, which include the following:  (b) restrain persons from accessing the securities market and prohibit any person associated with securities market to buy, sell or deal in securities; \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.. (f) direct any intermediary or any person associated with the securities market in any manner not to dispose of or alienate an asset forming part of any transaction which is under investigation 12. In the present case, I note that the interim order has been passed based on the prima facie analysis of the evidence/information as gathered during the examination/inquiry conducted into the affairs of the Noticee. The interim order prima facie records that the conduct of the Noticee is Order in the matter of M/s Tradebizz Research (Proprietor, Mr. Santosh Singh Parihar) Page 7 of 26    prejudicial and therefore, its continuation would not be in the interest of the investors and the securities market. The analysis of the complaints received from the clients of the Noticee and other circumstances which necessitated the requirement of issuance of those directions through the interim order, have already been elaborated in the said interim order itself. It is noted that, on merits, the Noticee has not been able to factually dispute any of the said factual findings so as to make out a case that the interim directions were not warranted. Further, as stated above, the interim order has also been issued as a show cause notice and the opportunity of a post decisional hearing has also been accorded to the Noticee. Therefore, it is observed that in terms of the extant regulatory framework governing the present case, a post-decisional hearing is a sufficient compliance with the principles of natural justice. I note that the legal jurisprudence on the issue of compliance of principles of natural justice by affording a post-decisional hearing may be culled out from various judgments of courts, few of which relevant for the purpose of the present proceedings, are quoted herein below:  i. It is worthwhile to quote the observations of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court made in the matter of Liberty Oil Mills & Others Vs. Union of India & Other (1984) 3 SCC 465: \"It may not even be necessary in some situations to issue such notices but it would be sufficient but obligatory to consider any representation that may be made by the aggrieved person and that would satisfy the requirements of procedural fairness and natural justice. There can be no tape-measure of the extent of natural justice. It may and indeed it must vary from statute to statute, situation to situation and case to case. Again, it is necessary to say that pre-decisional natural justice is not usually contemplated when the decisions taken are of an interim nature pending investigation or enquiry. Ad-interim orders may always be made ex-parte and such orders may themselves provide for an opportunity to the aggrieved party to be heard at a later stage. Even if the interim orders do not make provision for such an opportunity, an aggrieved party have, nevertheless, always the right to make appropriate representation seeking a review of the order and asking the authority to rescind or modify the order. The principles of natural justice would be satisfied if the aggrieved party is given an opportunity at the request. \" ii. In the matter of Anand Rathi & Others Vs. SEBI [2002 (2) BomCR 403], Hon'ble Bombay High Court ruled that post decisional hearing would also show compliance of principles of natural justice. The exact observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court are:\"\\\\\\\\u202631. It is thus clearly seen that pre decisional natural justice is not always necessary when ad-interim orders are made pending investigation or enquiry, unless so provided by the statute and rules of natural justice would be satisfied if the affected party is given post decisional hearing. It is not that Order in the matter of M/s Tradebizz Research (Proprietor, Mr. Santosh Singh Parihar) Page 8 of 26    natural justice is not attracted when the orders of suspension or like orders of interim nature are made. The distinction is that it is not always necessary to grant prior opportunity of hearing when ad-interim orders are made and principles of natural justice will be satisfied if post decisional hearing is given if demanded\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d iii. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur also had an occasion to deal with the issue of post-decisional hearing in the matter of M/s. Avon Realcon Pvt. Ltd. & Ors Vs. Union of India &Ors (D.B. Civil WP No. 5135/2010 Raj HC). In the said matter, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court have observed as:  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026Perusal of the provisions of Sections 11(4) & 11(B) shows that the Board is given powers to take few measures either pending investigation or enquiry or on its completion. The Second Proviso to Section 11, however, makes it clear that either before or after passing of the orders, intermediaries or persons concerned would be given opportunity of hearing. In the light of aforesaid, it cannot be said that there is absolute elimination of the principles of natural justice. \\\\\\\\u2026 The fact, however, remains as to whether post-decisional hearing can be a substitute for pre-decisional hearing. It is a settled law that unless a statutory provision either specifically or by necessary implication excludes the application of principles of natural justice, the requirement of giving reasonable opportunity exists before an order is made. The case herein is that by statutory provision, principles of natural justice are adhered to after orders are passed. This is to achieve the object of SEBI Act.\\\\\\\\u201d  13.  Thus, in light of the aforesaid judgments and the fact that a post-decisional hearing has been duly accorded to the Noticee in terms of second proviso Section 11 (4), which reads as: \\\\\\\\u201cProvided further that the Board shall, either before or after passing such orders, give an opportunity of hearing to such intermediaries or persons concerned.\\\\\\\\u201d; I am of the firm view that the principles of natural justice have sufficiently been complied with in the present case. The grievance/objection of the Noticee is thus rejected as the same is devoid of any merit and not tenable under the extant provisions of law cited above.  14. The Noticee has also raised objection on the powers of SEBI directing the Noticee not to dispose of or alienate his assets. It has been contended by the Noticee that the direction is without any jurisdiction as the same has not been approved by an order of the Judicial Magistrate First Class. Having gone through the contention of the Noticee, I find that the same is wholly misplaced; Section 11 (4) (f) of SEBI Act, 1992 in clear and unequivocal terms empowers SEBI to issue such direction against any intermediary or person associated with securities market Order in the matter of M/s Tradebizz Research (Proprietor, Mr. Santosh Singh Parihar) Page 9 of 26    and issuance of such direction is not subjected to approval by the Judicial Magistrate First Class. The Noticee should note that the said direction has been issued while exercising powers under Section 11(4) (f) of SEBI Act, 1992 and not while exercising powers under Section 11(4) (e) of SEBI Act, 1992. The approval of the Judicial Magistrate First Class is required in case of an attachment of bank accounts of any intermediary or person associated with securities market. From the perusal of the directions issued under the interim order, it is evident that same has been issued in exercise of power under Section 11 (4) (f) of SEBI Act, 1992 hence, the contention of the Noticee is entirely misplaced and not tenable.  15. It is noted that the Noticee has also challenged the restraint imposed on its business activity as an investment adviser by terming such restraint to be ultra vires to the Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution of India. In this connection, I note that Article 19 (1) (g) confers a fundamental right on every citizen of India to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. However, simultaneously, Article 19 (6) envisages imposition of reasonable restrictions on such a right, in the interest of general public. In this context, I find it apt to seek guidance from the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur, passed in the matter of M/S Punit Mercantile Pvt Ltd. Vs. Union of India and others (29 October, 2010). In the said matter, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court while appreciating the whole scheme of SEBI Act, 1992, have inter alia observed as: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026Perusal of aforesaid paras shows that the SEBI Act is pre-eminently a social welfare legislation seeking to protect the interests of common men who are small investors. A restrained order for same period from accessing the security market and prohibiting buying, selling and dealing in security was not held to be a penalty. Looking to the object of the SEBI Act, provisions of Sections 11(4) & 11(B) of the SEBI Act imposes a reasonable restriction in conformity to Clause (6) of Article 19 of the Constitution of India. This is in the larger interest of the investors and to achieve the objects of SEBI Act. In the light of aforesaid, we do not find that provisions of Sections 11(4) & 11(B) of the SEBI Act are violative of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. Accordingly, challenge to the constitutional validity of the aforesaid provisions is not accepted. Thus, the provisions are held to be intra-vires\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d 16. Though the aforesaid observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court are not directly dwelling on the business activity of any registered intermediary like an IA in the present case, however, the same may be extended to the facts of the present case, as Section 11 (2) (b) of SEBI Act, 1992 provides that SEBI may take any measure as it thinks fit in order to regulate the working of investment advisers. Further, Section 11 (2) (e) of SEBI Act, 1992, provides for initiation of actions for prohibiting fraudulent and unfair trade practices relating to securities market. In Order in the matter of M/s Tradebizz Research (Proprietor, Mr. Santosh Singh Parihar) Page 10 of 26    view of the above discussion, I observe that the argument of interim order being violative of Article 19 (1) (g) is also not tenable and is therefore rejected.  17. After addressing the aforesaid technical objections raised by the Noticee, I shall now move on to evaluate the factual conspectus of the case and for the said purpose, the business model of the Noticee needs to be examined first. From the material available on record, the following details with respect to the operations of the Noticee are noted:  i. The Noticee was offering numerous advisory products to its clients viz., Stock Cash, Stock/Nifty futures, Stock/Nifty Option, Commodity Market (MCX/NCDEX), etc. ii. Based on the period of subscription of services (monthly, quarterly etc.), the fee for such products was in the range of INR 7000/- to INR 2,84,000/-. The Noticee had, till June 12, 2019, received a total fee of INR 13,54,37,734/-. iii. Based on the information available on the website of the Noticee, it appears that the clients have been given tips through SMS/calls, and such tips were based on technical analysis.  18. SEBI has received numerous complaints against the Noticee and those complaints were backed with various evidences like emails, documents received from the Noticee, whatsapp conversation, recordings of the telephonic calls between the employees of the Noticee and investors/complainants. In this regard, I note that the interim order mentions under para 43 that the records of telephonic conversations have not been relied upon for arriving at the prima facie findings against the Noticee, however, the said details have been duly furnished to the Noticee so as to avoid creation of any prejudice and further to provide the Noticee with sufficient materials to enable it to defend effectively, the allegations made against it under the interim order cum show cause notice. I have no hesitation in considering all the materials available before me including the call records, for effective and meaningful disposal of the instant proceedings. I note that the Noticee has been given adequate opportunities to rebut/clarify the imputations made based on the said call recordings as well (apart from other allegations made in the SCN), however I find that the Noticee has preferred to assail the findings recorded in the interim order majorly on the technical grounds and has not made argument sufficient to make a case for exoneration from the charges levelled in the interim order.   19. I note that the first charge on the Noticee is that while rendering advisory services to its clients, the Noticee has promised an assured and unrealistic returns from the investments, in case the Order in the matter of M/s Tradebizz Research (Proprietor, Mr. Santosh Singh Parihar) Page 11 of 26    investment is made based on the advice/tips, to be provided as a part of service packages of the Noticee. In this respect, the interim order has mentioned in detail, the relevant extracts of the communications exchanged between the employees of the Noticees with its clients, perusal of the which exposes that the employees of the Noticee have \\\\\\\\u201cassured\\\\\\\\u201d huge returns to its clients in order to persuade such clients to pay a large amount as a service fee. For illustration, communications exchanged with respect to the two investors/clients, whose whatsapp chats have been referred to in the interim order are examined here under:  Table no. 1 Client Name Assured Profit (in INR) Service Fee (in INR) Girish Sharma 2,70,000 1,20,000 Pramod Patel 3,00,000 91,000  20. From the extract of the whatsapp chats exchanged between the employee of the Noticee namely Ms. Richa and its client Mr. Girish Sharma, it is evident that the employee of the Noticee was promising the client an assured profit of INR 2.70 Lakh, and for the same, the Noticee would be charging a fee of INR 1.20 Lakh. It is further evident that the Noticee through its employee (Mr. Pratap Singh) promises through whatsapp chat to Mr. Pramod Patel that Mr. Patel would be getting an assured return of 1217% p.a. on an investment of INR 2.00 Lakh and to ensure such hefty return on the investment, the Noticee would be charging INR 91,000 as service fee.  Such misleading and fraudulent conduct of the Noticee further get exposed on perusal of materials which reveal that the Noticee was selling the STS Service Package/product to Mr. Pramod Patel, having tenure of 45 days, whereas the documents filed by the Noticee in response to the allegations made in the interim order show that the duration of the STS Service Package was for only 30 days. It is thus noted that the interim order cast serious charges on the Noticee for indulging in fraudulent act while rendering the services as an IA but the Noticee has made a bald denial of having made any such assurance. The conduct of the Noticee constrains me to observe that the Noticee has willingly and knowingly indulged in such acts of enticing the clients with assured returns which has influenced the decisions of its clients, who are investors in the securities market.  21. An investment adviser is a person or group of persons that conducts securities analysis and makes investment recommendations to the clients for which, they are entitled to charge a reasonable fee against the services so agreed to be rendered to the clients. The IA Regulations Order in the matter of M/s Tradebizz Research (Proprietor, Mr. Santosh Singh Parihar) Page 12 of 26    through its Code of Conduct expect that IA to act honestly, fairly and in the best interests of its clients and at the same time cast a duty on the IA, not only to act in the best interest of its clients but also to ensure that its acts are intended to ensure the integrity of securities market. While performing or rendering its services as an IA, it is required that the registered entity shall act diligently with due skill, care and, ensuring that its advice is offered after thorough analysis of the risk profile and risk appetite of its client, the financial strength of the clients, their investible earnings and the suitability of various investment products after taking into account available alternatives. The Regulations further cast duty on such registered intermediaries that while rendering services of an IA, they will have to seek from their clients, information about their financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives relevant to the services to be provided and shall make adequate disclosures of relevant material information pertaining the advice rendered while dealing with their clients. 22. Whereas, in the instant matter, contrary to the duty cast upon on IA through rules and regulations, as discussed above, I find that the Noticee has not indulged in any acts which can be said to be in the interest of investors and rather by indulging in various fraudulent acts that have been already highlighted in the foregoing paragraphs, so as to entice various clients to seek advice from him, has in fact attempted at jeopardising the integrity of securities market. The Noticee is found to have been promising to its clients\\\\\\\\u2019 astronomical returns about which the interim order makes categorical recording as a serious allegation, however, based on the mere denial on the part of the Noticee which is not supported by any strong argument/evidence, one has to conclude that the Noticee has silently accepted the said allegation. The reply of the Noticee is absolutely oblivious to this allegation and no explanation has been offered justifying the basis on which he was making such promises to its clients. It is observed that the Noticee has also attempted to take a defence that the whatsapp chats are done by employee and the communication by the Noticee have bene done by emails only, however, no records of such emails have been produced. Be that as it may be, the Noticee has not been able to dilute the allegation pertaining to an offer a promising return of 1217% on investment to one if its client.  23. It is further noted that the Noticee through its whatsapp chat has communicated to its clients that the tenure of STS Service Package was for a period of 45 days, whereas from the documents filed by the Noticee in response to the interim order, it is seen that the services for the said package was for a period of 30 days. In this respect, it is further noted that the Noticee is again silent and has offered no explanation as to why the document defines the tenure of the package as 30 days whereas the whatsapp chat promises clients that the tenure against the Order in the matter of M/s Tradebizz Research (Proprietor, Mr. Santosh Singh Parihar) Page 13 of 26    payment of INR 91,000/- for the above mentioned package was for 45 days. From the above, it is further evident that the Noticee has not only failed in observing due care and fairness in its conduct, but also at the same time has indulged in fraudulent and misleading acts knowingly to induce investors to trade in securities market under the temptation of earning unexpected return on their investment, as advised by the Noticee.  24.  As noted earlier, the Code of Conduct prescribes that the registered IA shall ensure that all the investments on which investment advice is rendered should be appropriate to the risk profile of respective client. The IA shall further follow a well-defined process for selecting investments, which should be based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment objectives and financial situation. However, in the instant proceedings, it has been observed that the Noticee has completely ignored the above process while recommending investment to its client", "Date": "2021-01-27", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Order in the matter of M/S Tradebizz Research (Proprietor, Mr. Santosh Singh Parihar)", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jan-2021/order-in-the-matter-of-m-s-tradebizz-research-proprietor-mr-santosh-singh-parihar-_48895.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 59168, "unique_record_id": "902aace8f5SEBI20210127", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6680f1ac7858910306471c9c", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 05:47:57", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "INR 1,20,000  \nINR 91,000", "gpt_audience": "1.

(The aforesaid entities are hereinafter individually referred to by their respective names/Noticee nos. and collectively as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d, unless the context specifies otherwise)  BACKGROUND  1. An investigation was conducted by Securities and Exchange Board of India (for convenience \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) into the trading activities in the scrip of Surabhi Chemicals & Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd. (Now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.)     Page 2 of 45   Investments Ltd. (now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.) (for convenience \\\\\\\\u201cSurabhi / Company\\\\\\\\u201d) for the period of August 01, 2012 to January 06, 2015 (for convenience \\\\\\\\u201cInvestigation Period\\\\\\\\u201d) for possible violation, if any, of the provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (for convenience \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) and rules and regulations made thereunder. 2. During the course of investigation, the price volume data in the scrip of the Company was analyzed. The period of investigation was divided into patches, however, for the purpose of the instant proceedings only two patches are relevant, wherein it was, inter alia, noticed that the price of the scrip of the Company was manipulated. The relevant periods were from August 10, 2012 to April 09, 2013 (Patch-1) and also from April 10, 2013 to September 04, 2013 (Patch-2). It was noticed that before the Investigation Period, there was no trading in the scrip for past one year and it was only on the day of start of the Investigation Period i.e. on August 01, 2012, the price of the scrip opened at \\\\\\\\u20b92.52 and then reached to a high of \\\\\\\\u20b959.35 on April 09, 2013. Subsequently, the scrip went through a stock split in the ratio of 10:1 after which the price of the scrip opened at \\\\\\\\u20b96 (unadjusted to split \\\\\\\\u20b960) on April 10, 2013 (start of Patch-2) and in 372 trades executed in the scrip of the Company on 102 trading days, the price of the scrip reached a level of \\\\\\\\u20b938.35 (unadjusted to split \\\\\\\\u20b9383.50) on September 04, 2013. The scrip witnessed increase in volume as well as price thereafter and witnessed an intra-day high of \\\\\\\\u20b9123 (unadjusted to split \\\\\\\\u20b91230) on December 02, 2014 before it closed at a price of \\\\\\\\u20b999.40 (unadjusted to split \\\\\\\\u20b9994) on January 06, 2015. 3. Details of price volume information in the scrip of Surabhi during the Investigation Period are presented in the chart below:  Chart 1: Price-Volume Chart Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd. (Now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.)     Page 3 of 45    4. Further, the detail of price volume movement in the scrip of Surabhi during the Investigation Period is tabulated below: Table-1: Price-Volume movement in scrip of Surabhi Dates Open ( \\\\\\\\u20b9)  Close ( \\\\\\\\u20b9)  Low (Date) ( \\\\\\\\u20b9)  High (Date) ( \\\\\\\\u20b9)  Avg. no. of (shares) traded daily during the period. 10/08/12-09/04/2013 (Patch-1) Price rise- Pre Split Price  2.52 59.35 2.52 (10 Aug 12) 59.35 (09 Apr 13) 287 Vol.  100   30  0 (13 Aug 12) 31,620 (26 Mar 13) 10/04/2013-04/09/2013 (Patch-2) Price rise \\\\\\\\u2013 Post-split Price  6.00 38.35 6.00(10 Apr 13) 38.35(04 Sep 13) 286 Vol.  150   225  1(20 Aug 13) 5,730 (28 Aug 13)  5. In the course of investigation conducted by SEBI, while analyzing the price and trade movement in the scrip of Surabhi, following facts, inter alia, came to light: a) It was noted that neither the financials nor the corporate announcements made by the Company supported such a significant price rise of scrip during Patch-1 and Patch-2 of the Investigation Period.  02040608010012002000004000006000008000001000000120000010-Aug-1210-Oct-1210-Dec-1210-Feb-1310-Apr-1310-Jun-1310-Aug-1310-Oct-1310-Dec-1310-Feb-1410-Apr-1410-Jun-1410-Aug-1410-Oct-1410-Dec-14PriceVolumeVolumeClose Price Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd. (Now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.)     Page 4 of 45   b) It was revealed that the Noticee nos. 1 to 3 are connected with each other and these three Noticees through their 73 sell trades during Patch-1 of the Investigation Period have together contributed \\\\\\\\u20b933.18 to the positive Last Traded Price (for convenience \\\\\\\\u201cLTP\\\\\\\\u201d) which was 58.38% of the total market positive LTP in the scrip of Surabhi during the Patch-1. It was further unearthed from the trading pattern of these three Noticees that they were repeatedly placing sell orders for small order quantities across different trading days in the scrip of Surabhi when buy orders at prices higher than LTP and for large quantities were pending in the stock exchange\\\\\\\\u2019s system, which resulted into execution of trades at price higher than the LTP thereby contributing positive LTP in the scrip of the Company. c) Investigation further unearthed that Noticee nos. 4 & 6 are connected entities; Noticee nos. 5 & 8 are connected entities; and Noticee nos. 7 & 9 are also connected to each other. Further, from the trading pattern exhibited by these 6 Noticees (Noticee nos. 4 to 9) in selling the shares of the Company, it was again revealed that during the Patch-2 of the Investigation Period, despite availability of pending buy orders of large quantities of shares in the trading system, these 6 Noticees have released shares in smaller quantities at prices higher than the LTP. The total LTP contributions made by the sell trades of these 9 Noticees are tabulated hereunder:  Table-2: Noticee wise contribution in the scrip of Surabhi Sr. No. Noticee nos. LTP (in \\\\\\\\u20b9) %age to total market positive LTP 1.  Noticee nos. 1 to 3 (Patch-1) 33.18 58.38% 2.  Noticee nos. 5 & 8 (Patch-2) 8.07 24.80% 3.  Noticee nos. 4 & 6 (Patch-2) 9.95 30.58% Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd. (Now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.)     Page 5 of 45   4.  Noticee nos. 7 & 9 (Patch-2) 4.98 15.30% 6. In view of aforementioned trading pattern coupled with contribution to the price rise in the scrip of the Company as noticed during investigation, it has been alleged that the Noticee nos. 1 to 3 during the Patch-1 and Noticees no. 4 to 9 during the Patch-2 of the Investigation Period have been instrumental in establishing a price higher than the LTP and have contributed to increase in scrip price with their unusual unfair, manipulative and fraudulent trades. It is thus alleged that these Noticees have manipulated the price of the scrip of Surabhi upwards and have created a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip by executing such fraudulent trades in small quantities. Such acts of the Noticees have been alleged to be in breach of provisions of Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and Regulation 4(1), 4(2) (a), (e) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (for convenience \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations, 2003\\\\\\\\u201d). SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, HEARING AND REPLIES 7. The above findings of the investigation led to the issuance of a common Show Cause Notice dated April 04, 2018 (for convenience \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) to all the 9 Noticees, asking them to show cause as to why suitable direction(s) under Section 11(1), 11(4) & 11 (B) SEBI Act, 1992 should not be issued against them for their alleged violations of provisions of SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003. 8. I note from the available records that the aforesaid SCN was duly served on all the Noticees, in response to which all of the Noticees have submitted their replies. I note from the reply submitted on behalf of Noticee no. 2, that she has expired on 05.01.2014 and in this regard, copy of death certificate issued by Heath Department, Government of Maharashtra has been submitted to SEBI. I note that Noticee nos. 4, 6, 7 and 9 had sought inspection of documents which was provided to them by SEBI on January 08, 2019. Subsequently, in compliance with the principle of natural justice, an opportunity of personal hearing was accorded to the Noticees intimating them the scheduled date of hearing as fixed on July 02, 2019. The hearing notices were duly Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd. (Now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.)     Page 6 of 45   served on all the Noticees, however, Authorized Representative (AR) for Noticee nos. 7 and 9 only appeared before me on the said date and presented their case. Further, adjournment was sought by Noticee nos. 1, 3, 5 and 8. Accordingly, their request for adjournment was acceded to and another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to Noticee nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 on December 18, 2019, however, no one attended on behalf of any of the aforementioned Noticees on the said date. Subsequently, another opportunity for personal hearing was scheduled on January 09, 2020, and that date the AR on behalf of only Noticee nos. 4 and 6 appeared before me and made their submissions, while Noticee nos. 5 and 8 sought adjournment for personal hearing. Accordingly, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted on to Noticee nos. 5 and 8 on August 26, 2020, which was attended by their ARs. However, I note that no one appeared on behalf of Noticee nos. 1 and 3 nor any further request for adjournment has been received on behalf of them. I am of the view that adequate number of opportunities of personal hearing have been provided to Noticee nos. 1 and 3, however, they have chosen to not appear before me for reasons best known to them. Therefore, matter is ripe enough to be proceeded and finalized based on merit and on the basis of material available on record, including the written replies to SCN already filed before SEBI on various dates as indicated below: - Table-3: Details of reply filed by the Noticees Noticee No.  Date of Reply Noticee no. 1 Letters dated April 23, 2018, June 01, 2018 Noticee no. 2 Letter dated April 23, 2018 Noticee no. 3 Letters dated April 23, 2018, June 01, 2018, 01 July, 2019 Noticee no. 4 Letters dated April 27, 2018, June 01, 2018, January 02, 2020, February 07, 2020, September 12, 2020 Noticee no. 5 Letters dated May 28, 2018, August 26, 2020, September 09, 2020, October 14, 2020 Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd. (Now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.)     Page 7 of 45    Noticee no. 6 Letters dated April 27, 2018 June 01, 2018, January 02, 2020, February 07, 2020, September 12, 2020 Noticee no. 7 Letters dated May 30, 2018, June 29, 2019, September 14, 2020 Noticee no. 8 Letters dated June 01, 2018, September 09, 2020, August 25, 2020, October 14, 2020 Noticee no. 9 Letters dated May 30, 2018, June 29, 2019, September 14, 2020  9. After perusing the written replies submitted by the Noticees (as indicated in the preceding table), I note that different Noticees have submitted various identical replies. For the sake of brevity, I am summarizing those identical replies / submissions as under: Common submissions made by the Noticees  a) The Noticees have traded in the scrip of Surabhi in the normal course of their trading based on their commercial sense. SEBI has ignored and overlooked various corporate announcements made by the Company during the Investigation Period and such announcements would have definitely impacted the price and volume in the shares of Surabhi. b) The sell orders were placed at the price based on the buy orders which were already pending in the stock exchange\\\\\\\\u2019s system. A seller would sell shares at the highest buy order rates pending in the stock exchange\\\\\\\\u2019s system. Therefore, no adverse inference can be drawn from such transactions. Further, none of the counterparties / buyers to their trades have been made party in the SCN by SEBI for any violations of SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003. c) Sell trades made by the Noticees are very miniscule as compared to the total number of shares traded in the scrip of Company. Therefore, with such small quantities, Noticees could not have manipulated the price of the scrip of Surabhi. Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd. (Now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.)     Page 8 of 45   d) Inordinate delay in issuance of SCN has caused prejudice to the Noticees while justifying their case. In this regard, reliance has been placed on the following judicial observations: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Ashok Shivpal Rupani & Ors. vs. SEBI (DoD: 22.08.2019, Appeal no. 417 and 440 of 2018) \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the matter of Ashlesh Gunvantbhai & Ors. vs. SEBI (DoD: 31.01.2020, Appeal no. 169, 171, 172, 231, 264, 266 and 277-281 of 2019) e) Certain Noticees have referred to following judgements of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court while advancing arguments that there are no sufficient evidences to prove the violation of SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the matter of Varanasaya Sanskrit Vidyalaya & Anr. vs Dr, Rajkishore Tripathi and Anr. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the matter of Bank of India Degala Surya Narayana (AIR 1999 SC 2407) \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the matter of M.S. Bindra V Vol (1998) 7 SCC \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the matter of Nandakishore Prasad vs. State of Bihar (1978) 3 SCC 366 \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the matter of Union of India vs. H.C. Goel (AIR 1964 SC 364)  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the matter of L.D. Jaisinghani vs. Naraindas N. Punjabi (1976) 1 SCC 354: AIR 1976 SC 373 \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the matter of Razik Ram vs. J. S. Chauhan- AIR 1975 SC 667; (1975) 4 SCC 769 \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the matter of Gulab Dehand vs. Kudilal (AIR 1966 SC 1734) 10. In addition to the above submissions, certain Noticees have made additional arguments related to the allegations made in the SCN which are summarized as under: Noticee nos. 4, 6, 7 and 9 a) The Noticees have sought the inspection of Investigation Report (IR), however, the same was not provided to the Noticees. In this regard, the Noticees have relied upon the following judgements: Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd. (Now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.)     Page 9 of 45   \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in matter of S.L. Kapoor vs Jagmohan & Ors (DoD:18/09/1980) Equivalent citations: 1981 AIR, 136, 1981 SCR (1) 746; \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in matter of Vikas Gourihar Narnavar vs. SEBI (Date of Decision: 15/06/2010 in Appeal no. 281 of 2009).  b) Noticees have not executed any trades wherein they were counter party to each other\\\\\\\\u2019s trade. Therefore, the allegation of connection is baseless having no relevance. Noticees have relied upon the observations of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT in the following matters to further their contention:  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Premchand Shah & Ors. vs. SEBI (Date of Decision: 21/02/2011) \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Narendra Ganatra vs. SEBI (Date of Decision: 29/07/2011) \\\\\\\\uf0b7  Smitaben N. Shah vs. SEBI (Date of Decision 30/07/2010) c) When there were huge volumes in the scrip of the Company, the price of the scrip was increasing on those days also. Therefore, the allegation that the price of the scrip increased due to small quantities of sell orders is baseless. d)  A charge of market manipulation is a very serious allegation which should be supported with higher degree of evidence. The present SCN has not been issued to the Noticees on the basis of any connection with the Company / its promoters / directors or counterparties to their trades. Further, it is not alleged in the SCN that the Noticees have been benefitted in any manner from such alleged manipulation. e) Noticees have relied upon the following judgements / rulings of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT to further support their arguments: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the matter of Vikas Ganshmal Bengani vs. WTM SEBI (Date of Decision: 25.02.2010 in Appeal 225 of 2009);  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the matter of KSL & Industries Ltd. vs. Chairman, SEBI (Date of Decision: 30.09.2003, Appeal 9 of 2003) \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the matter of Kapil Chatrabhuj Bhuptani vs. SEBI (Date of Decision: 10.10.2013, Appeal 95 of 2013) Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd.

Ltd. vs. SEBI (Date of Decision: 27.08.2008) \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the matter of M/s Nishith Shah (HUF) vs. SEBI (Date of Decision: 16.01.2020, Appeal 97 of 2019) \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In the matter of Mukesh Kumar Sohanlalji Gupta vs. SEBI (Date of Decision: 28.01.2020, Appeal 440 of 2019) f) Noticee nos. 4 and 6 have relied upon following SEBI orders to support genuineness of their trading pattern / behaviour in the scrip of Surabhi: \\\\\\\\uf0b7  WTM Order May 31, 2019 in favour of Amit Tilala in the matter of Essar (India) Ltd. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 AO Order February 24, 2020 in in favour of Ms. Sushma Agarwal in the matter of Winsome Yarns Limited. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 AO Order March 06, 2020 in in favour of Ms. Sangita Pramod Harlalka in the matter of Radford Global Ltd. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 AO Order March 23, 2020 in in favour of Mr. Lokesh N Mistry in the matter of Alexander Stamps and Coin Limtied. Noticee no. 5 and 8 g) Promoters of the Noticee companies nos. 5 and 8 i.e. Mr. Dilip Doshi and Tapan Doshi had acquired the Noticee companies no. 5 and 8 on February 28, 2013 and they had no knowledge about the bank accounts and trading accounts from where the alleged trades were executed and the despite the change in promoters of the company the authorised signatories of the aforesaid bank accounts and trading accounts remain unchanged. One Ms. Rupal Suryavanshi Vasant was the authorised signatory in the Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd. (Now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.)     Page 11 of 45   aforementioned bank accounts and trading account of Noticee no. 5 and had executed the alleged trades without the knowledge of current promoters of the Noticee no. 5 and 8. Similarly, one Mr. Kanchan Ramesh Mokal was the authorised signatory in the bank accounts and trading account of Noticee no. 8 and had executed those alleged trades without the knowledge of the current promoters of the Noticee no. 8. Noticee no. 5 and 8 have also filed an affidavit of their Chartered Accountant (Mr. Damodar Sarda) in support of the submissions that the trades were not executed under their instructions and consent and after 7 years, it is not possible to recollect the exact reasons for trading in the scrip. Nonetheless, nothing unusual is noticed in the trades so executed in the matter as the same were not executed with any intent to manipulate the price and no evidence of connection with counter party or with the promoter/director of the Company has been found mentioned in the SCN.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINIDNGS: 11. Considering the findings of Investigation, the allegations levelled against the Noticees in the SCN based on such findings and the explanations offered by the Noticees through their written replies to the SCN, I find that the only issue that requires consideration is as follows: Whether the acts of trading in the scrip of the Company by the Noticee nos. 1 to 3 during the Patch-1 and the Noticee nos. 4 to 9 during the Patch-2 of Investigation Period have resulted in violations of the provisions of Regulation 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and Regulation 4 (1) and 4 (2) (a) and (e) of SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003? 12. Before proceeding to examine the aforesaid question on the basis of the facts of the matter, it would be proper to refer to the relevant provisions of the SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003 which have been allegedly breached by the Noticees and the same read as under: - Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd. (Now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.)     Page 12 of 45   PFUTP Regulations, 2003  3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities  No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014  a) use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under;  (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange;  (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.   4.

(e) any act or omission amounting to manipulation of the price of a security; \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd. (Now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.)     Page 13 of 45   Trades of Noticee nos. 1, 2 and 3 during the Patch-1 13. Before I proceed to deal with the trades of Noticee nos. 1 to 3 (for convenience \\\\\\\\u201c3 Noticees\\\\\\\\u201d), it is pertinent to note that the SCN has also alleged that these 3 Noticees were connected amongst each other. Details about connection amongst these 3 Noticees are given below:   14. From the above pictorial representation, I note that the 3 Noticees enjoyed sufficient commonalities & nexus so as to be held as connected to each other. As shown above, these 3 Noticees were sharing Common UCC phone number, email id and address. For instance, Noticee no.1 (Mr. Rajnikant Maganlal Mehta) shared Common UCC, phone number, email id and address with Noticee no. 2 (Ms. Heena Kaushik Mehta) and Common UCC, common phone number with Noticee no. 3 (Mr. Pravin Mahendra Pagare). Similarly, Noticee no. 2 and Noticee no. 3 are connected to each other on the basis of Common UCC and common phone number. The materials on record show that none of the 3 Noticees has produced any evidence or counter argument to refute the allegations of inter-connectedness amongst them. Therefore, in the absence of any materials contrary to the allegations, I find that the materials on record are sufficient to reasonably conclude that the 3 Noticees were connected amongst themselves. Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd. (Now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.)     Page 14 of 45   15. During Patch-1 of the Investigation Period, price of scrip of the Company opened at \\\\\\\\u20b92.52 on August 10, 2012, then reached a high of \\\\\\\\u20b959.35 on April 09, 2013 and then closed at price of \\\\\\\\u20b959.35 creating a market positive LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b956.83 with a total traded volume of 36156 shares. As pointed out earlier, the main allegation in the SCN is that by executing manipulative sell trades during the Patch-1 of the Investigation Period, the 3 Noticees have contributed to the positive LTP in the scrip of Surabhi. Therefore, to find out as to whether the details of trades executed by the 3 Noticees during the Patch-1 had impacted and contributed to the LTP of the scrip of Surabhi during the said Patch-1 of the Investigation Period, the trades require to be examined are presented in the table below: Table-4: Trading by Noticees nos. 1 to 3 during Patch-1 Sl. No Noticee no.  Total No. of trades Total No. of trades (LTP >0) Total no. of orders  Sell order qty range Trade Quantity Positive LTP contribution (\\\\\\\\u20b9) % of positive LTP to Total Market positive LTP No. of shares held before these trades  Balance no. of shares held after LTP trades in Patch-1  1 Noticee no. 1 72 29 71 1-7 359 13.65 24.02% 400 41 2 Noticee no. 2 23 17 23 3-14 163 10.76 18.93% 200 37 3 Noticee no. 3 39 27 39 1-6 197 8.77 15.43% 200 3  Total of Noticee no. 1 to 3 134 73    33.18 58.38%    Market Total       56.83     16. As already established above, as these 3 Noticees were connected with each other, it is appropriate to examine their sell trades in totality. From the trades presented in above table, it is noted that during the Patch-1 period of trading in the scrip of Surabhi, the 3 Noticees have cumulatively executed 134 trades and out of these 134 trades, the SCN alleges that through 73 trades they had contributed a total Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd. (Now known as Superspace Infrastructure Ltd.)     Page 15 of 45   positive LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b933.18 which constituted 58.38% of the total market positive LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b956.83 that was witnessed in the scrip during the said period i.e. Patch-1. I also observe from the SCN that such positive LTP of \\\\\\\\u20b933.18 was contributed by the group of 3 Noticees from their trading in only 423 shares which is just 1.17% of the total shares traded (36156 shares) in the scrip of Surabhi during the Patch-1 of the Investigation Period. The aforesaid trading behavior wherein a group of 3 Noticees have contributed to more than 58% of total positive market LTP by executing less than approximately 1% of the total trades in the scrip of Surabhi during the said period, raises strong doubt about the intent and the trading pattern adopted by these 3 Noticees.  17. I further observe from the details as available on records that each of those 73 positive LTP contributing trades was the \\\\\\\\u2018first trade\\\\\\\\u2019 executed on the respective trading days. Trade wise order details of the aforementioned 73 trades contributing to positive LTP are tabulated below: Table-5: Order details of trades executed by Noticees nos. 1 to 3 during Patch-1 Sr. No Trade Date Seller Name Buy Order Time Sell Order Time Buy Order Rate Sell Order Rate Trade Rate LTP Diff %LTP Buy Qty Sell Qty Trade Qty 1 27-Nov-12 Rajnikant Maganlal Mehta 09:00:01 11:31:54 10.67 10.67 10.67 0.20 0.35% 200 4 4 2 29-Nov-12 Heena Kaushik Mehta 09:00:00 12:45:07 10.88 10.88 10.88 0.21 0.37% 1600 5 5 3 30-Nov-12 Pravin Mahendra Pagare 09:00:00 12:51:48 11.09 11.09 11.09 0.21 0.37% 1000 5 5 4 3-Dec-12 Rajnikant Maganlal Mehta 09:00:00 12:04:18 11.31 11.31 11.31 0.22 0.39% 2000 6 6 5 4-Dec-12 Rajnikant Maganlal Mehta 09:00:01 11:43:13 11.53 11.53 11.53 0.22 0.39% 500 5 5 6 5-Dec-12 Rajnikant Maganlal Mehta 09:00:00 10:14:52 11.76 11.76 11.76 0.23 0.40% 1000 6 6 Order in the matter of Surabhi Chemicals & Investments Ltd.

During the course of investigation, it was inter-alia observed by SEBI that MPS failed to inform Bombay Stock Exchange(BSE) of the account charge agreement entered into with BANCO EFISA, S.A. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cBANCO\\\\\\\\u201d), a Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd.

It was also observed that MPS had not disclosed an amount of US $ 8.88 million (as on March 31, 2008) lying in its account with BANCO as contingent liability in its financial statements for the financial year 2007-08. By not disclosing the contingent liability in its financial statements, MPS had not adhered to the provisions of Audit Standard (AS) \\\\\\\\u2013 29 issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).  It was also observed that MPS had devised a fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative scheme through the arrangement of Credit Agreement entered by Clifford Capital Partners A.G.S.A.  (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cCLIFFORD\\\\\\\\u201d) with BANCO, wherein the subscription amount of GDRs was paid by CLIFFORD by availing a loan from BANCO and Account Charge agreement entered into with BANCO by MPS by pledging the proceeds of GDR as collateral against the loan availed by CLIFFORD. The aforesaid arrangement was not disclosed in public domain, which not only misled investors with such false and misleading information, but also enabled MPS to made investors to believe that the said GDR issue was genuinely subscribed by the foreign investors and influenced the decision of investors to deal in the shares of MPS. The aforesaid manipulative and deceptive act had resulted in allotment of GDRs without actual receipt of consideration.   It was also observed that the Board of MPS had passed a Resolution in its Meeting on October 19, 2007, wherein decision was taken to open an account with BANCO and also to authorize BANCO to use the GDR proceeds as security against loan. The said Board Resolution, inter alia, included opening of a bank account with BANCO for the purpose of receiving subscription money in respect of the GDR issue of the Company. The company had authorized Mr. Rajinder Singh (Noticee 4) to enter into any escrow agreement or similar arrangements and authorized BANCO to use the funds deposited in its bank account as a security in connection with loans sanctioned to CLIFFORD. It was further Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd.

The aforesaid SCN was served upon the Noticees.   4. The fact of the case and the allegations made in the SCN are summarised below:  a) SEBI had conducted investigation during November 01, 2007 to December 31, 2007 regarding the issuance of Global Depository Receipts (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cGDRs\\\\\\\\u201d) by M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd. It was observed that M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd. issued 46,54,762 Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) (US$9.99 Million, approximately Rs. 39.42 Crores) on December 04, 2007. Summary of GDRs issued by M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd is as under:  GDR issue  date No. of GDRs Issued (mn.) Capital raised (US$ mn.)

It was further observed that Noticee 4, on behalf of the Company, signed an Account Charge Agreement dated October 30, 2007 with BANCO (the company pledged GDR proceeds as collateral against the loan availed by CLIFFORD). It was further observed that the Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on December 04, 2007, allotted 4,654,762 GDRs representing 9,309,524 Equity Shares having par value Rs 10/- at an offer price of $2.148 per GDR which made investors believe that the said GDR issue was genuinely subscribed by the foreign investors whereas the subscription of GDR issue was through Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd.                                       Page 5 | 26  the above said arrangement of Credit Agreement and Account Charge Agreement by CLIFFORD and the Company respectively.  c) The aforesaid fraudulent arrangement of Credit Agreement and Account Charge Agreement resulted in subscription of GDR issue of the company and the aforesaid arrangement was not disclosed by MPS. Further, the company submitted a false list of GDR subscribers to SEBI.  The corporate announcements made by the Company were meant to mislead the investors that the GDRs were fully subscribed whereas the GDR issue was indirectly supported by the company itself. Its alleged that the aforesaid failure by Company influenced the decision of investors to deal in the shares of MPS.   d) from the documents available on record, following utilization of the GDRs was observed:   Date of debit in MPS\\\\\\\\u2019 account with Banco Amount of USD debited in MPS\\\\\\\\u2019 account with Banco Date of credit to MPS\\\\\\\\u2019 Indian bank account Amount of funds received by  MPS in India (INR) Remarks 07/01/2008 950,000.00 08/01/2008 3,72,57,726.00 Received in Indian bank account of MPS with DBS Bank 07/01/2008 150,000.00 NA NA Legal Charges for Lead manager 09/01/2008 17,798.00 NA NA Lead manager\\\\\\\\u2019s Fee 03/04/2008 200,000.00 NA NA Paid to Global Absolute Research P. Ltd  29/01/2009 100,000.00 30/01/2009 48,48,695.00 Received in Indian bank account of MPS with Citi Bank 20/03/2009 8,883,210.75 NA NA Amount adjusted by Banco to loan account of Clifford  14/04/2009 14,908.57 NA NA Amount adjusted by Banco to loan account of Clifford 11/06/2015 48,597.57 15/06/2015 30,69,642.55 Received in Indian bank account of MPS with HDFC Bank TOTAL 10,364,514.89     e) It was observed from the company\\\\\\\\u2019s deposit account (a/c no: 6434108525008) with BANCO that an amount of US $8.80 million was Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd.                                       Page 6 | 26  transferred to its current account with BANCO (i.e. a/c no: 6341085.15.001) on March 20, 2009 and there was no balance lying in the deposit account as on March 20, 2009. It was observed that an amount of $8.89 million, US $0.01 million were debited to company\\\\\\\\u2019s current account on March 20, 2009 and April 14, 2009 respectively. It was further observed that an amount of US $8.89 million (principal amount due- US $8,798,450, interest due- US $84760.75) was due from CLIFFORD to BANCO on March 20, 2009 and accordingly an amount of US $8.89 million was adjusted by BANCO towards the outstanding loan amount of CLIFFORD, as the company has guaranteed to the Loan taken by CLIFFORD through account charge agreement. It was further observed that an amount of US $0.01 million was adjusted by BANCO on April 14, 2009 as default interest for failure to pay the loan outstanding on due date.   f) Therefore, from the aforesaid, it was noted that CLIFFORD was the sole subscriber to the GDR issue, it has defaulted in repayment of Loan and also received GDRs, thereby GDRs to the extent of US $8.90 million were issued at free of cost. Hence, it was alleged that the issuance of GDRs at free of cost to the extent of US $8.90 million to CLIFFORD at the cost of other investors was fraudulent.   g) It was further observed from the corporate announcements made by the company to stock exchange during the investigation period that the company did not inform stock exchange with regard to account charge agreement entered with BANCO for subscription of GDRs of the company which was price sensitive information and could have impacted the price of scrip.   h) It was noted from the copy of the minutes of the Board Meeting dated October 19, 2007 that the company had authorized Mr. Rajinder Singh (Noticee 4) to enter into any escrow agreement or similar arrangements and authorized Banco to use the funds deposited in its bank account as a Adjudication Order in the matter of M/s. MPS Infotecnics Ltd.                                       Page 7 | 26  security in connection with loans if any availed. On the basis of authorization given by the Board, Mr. Rajinder Singh (Noticee 4), signed the agreement which acted as a security to the loan availed by Clifford for subscription of GDRs. It was further observed that the Noticee 1 was a non-executive and non-independent director, Noticee 2 was Managing Director and CEO, Noticee 3 was Executive and Non-Independent Director and Noticee 4 was Non-executive and independent Director of MPS. The Noticee1 to 3 were present in the board meeting dated October 19, 2007 and Noticee 4 executed the Account Charge Agreement with BANCO on behalf of Company. Therefore, its alleged that the Noticees had acted as a party to the abovementioned fraudulent, manipulative and deceptive scheme by MPS.  i) In light of the above it is alleged that the Noticees acted as party to the fraudulent scheme of GDR issue by MPS which is in violation of Section 12A(a), (b), (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003.  5. In response to the aforesaid SCN dated May 28, 2018, Noticee 1, 2 and 3 filed their replies. However, Noticee 4 did not submit any reply to SCN. Reply of Noticees (wherever available,), is summarised as under:   Reply submitted by the Noticee 1  Noticee 1 vide its reply dated January 21, 2019 and November 11, 2020 made its submissions to the SCN which is summarised as below:  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 At the outset, I deny all the allegations imposed on me vide notice dated May 28, 2018. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Incomplete inspection of documents, SEBI has not provided original/certified documents \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Documents/evidence received under treaty from Portugal can\\\\\\\\u2019t be used as evidence in Court of Law.

Page 8 | 26  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Deny of having executed account charge agreement with anybody. Fake rubber seal used on the account charge agreement \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is alleged that company had authorized Shri Rajender Singh to enter into any escrow or similar arrangement and authorized Banco to use the funds deposited in its Bank account as security in connection with loans, if any availed. The Directors (Including me) were present and approved the board meeting dated October 19, 2007 passing above resolution. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 On 19th October, 2007, the company passed a board resolution for opening a bank account with Banco Efisa for depositing the GDR proceeds. The format of the bank resolution was emailed by Mr. Rajinder Singh Negi.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Since the format of board resolution was provided by Mr. Rajiner Singh Negi, claiming it to be \\\\\\\\u2018specific format\\\\\\\\u2019 of resolution of Banco Efisa, there was no scope of making any alterations in the same and thus the company had to pass the resolution on the same lines as received from Mr. Rajinder Singh Negi, which was otherwise out of routine language. However, it is submitted that before the resolution for opening of bank account with Banco Efisa was passed, the Board had deliberated upon the draft resolution which it had received from Banco Efisa through Mr. Rajinder Singh Negi and Mr. Sanjiv Bhavnani. During the deliberations the other board members had raised queries with regard to the language used in the resolution to which Mr. Rajinder Singh Negi, (who was present and attended the Board Meeting dated 19.10.2007) and Mr.  Sanjiv Bhavnani had informed the Board that the draft of the resolution placed before the board is a standard resolution which the Banco had asked in order to open a bank account with them. Even in the Performa Resolution, no authority was given to Mr. Rajinder Singh Negi to create any charge on GDR proceeds or any other asset (including the Bank Accounts of the Company).  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The whole matter revolves around the fact that the cash so received by the company for GDR issue and deposited in the bank account held with Banco was never pledged for any loan availed by any third party and hence was freely available and utilized for the purpose for which GDR issue was floated.

(The aforesaid entities are hereinafter individually referred to by their respective names/Noticee nos. and collectively as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d, unless the context specifies otherwise) ___________________________________________________________________________ BACKGROUND 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) conducted an investigation pertaining to issuance of Global Depository Receipts (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cGDR\\\\\\\\u201d) by Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cKemrock/Company/Noticee no. 1\\\\\\\\u201d) for the period from April 1, 2010 to May 31, 2010. 2. It was observed that Kemrock had issued 4.83 million GDR for USD 50.00 million on April 29, 2010. Details of the GDR issued by the Company are tabulated below:     Order in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd. Page 2 of 44   GDR issue date No. of GDRs  issued (mn.) Capital raised (USD mn.) Local custodian No. of equity shares underlying GDRs Global Depository Bank Lead Manager Bank where GDR proceeds deposited GDRs listed on April 29, 2010  4,827,200  (at USD 10.36 per GDR) 50.00 DBS Bank, Mumbai  4,827,200  The Bank of New York Mellon Arkios Ltd. EURAM Bank, Austria Luxembourg Stock Exchange 3. During the investigation, it was revealed that Euram Bank, Austria (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cEuram Bank\\\\\\\\u201d) had granted loan to Vintage FZE (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cVintage\\\\\\\\u201d) by way of a Loan Agreement dated April 23, 2010 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cLoan Agreement\\\\\\\\u201d) to subscribe to the GDR issued by Kemrock and the entire amount of the said loan was used to subscribe all the 4.83 million GDR issued by the Company, resultantly, entire GDR issue was subscribed by only one entity, i.e. Vintage. 4. Investigation further revealed that the Company pledged its entire GDR proceeds with Euram Bank as a security against the aforesaid loan availed by Vintage from Euram Bank for subscribing to the GDR of Kemrock. For this purpose, the Company entered into a Pledge Agreement dated April 23, 2010 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cPledge Agreement\\\\\\\\u201d) with Euram Bank and the said agreement was signed by Noticee no. 2 on behalf of Kemrock. It has been noticed that the Company in its Board Meeting dated March 16, 2010, had passed a resolution for opening an account with Euram Bank wherein, the GDR proceeds were proposed to be deposited. The Board of the Company (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cBoard\\\\\\\\u201d) further authorised Euram Bank to use the GDR proceeds of the Company as security against loans, if any. Investigation also noticed that Noticees no. 3, 4 and 5 have certified the copy of Board Resolution dated March 16, 2010 to be true and therefore were aware of the Board Resolution authorizing Euram Bank to use the GDR proceeds so deposited in the said bank account as a security in connection with loan sanctioned to Vintage. During the course of investigation, it was also noticed that the Company had not disclosed to the investors about the arrangement so made by it to ensure the successful     Order in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd. Page 3 of 44   issuance/subscription/allotment of the GDR by facilitating a loan to Vintage in terms of the aforesaid Loan Agreement. It was concealed from the public that the proceeds of GDR would be kept as security with the Euram Bank and would not be made available for the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s immediate use. Thus, the Company had concealed material facts from its shareholders as well as from the investors of Securities Market and had indulged in a fraudulent scheme to ensure the success of issuance of GDR, thereby inducing the domestic investors to trade in its securities without being able to take an informed decision. The above acts of providing partial and distorted information to the public about issuance of GDR by the Company were observed to be falling in the category of fraudulent acts on the part of the Noticees to mislead and induce the shareholders/investors at large. SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING 5. Based on the above narrated findings made in the investigation, a common Show Cause Notice (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) dated August 28, 2018 was issued to all the Noticees, wherein Noticee no. 1 was charged with violations of Section 12A (a), (b) & (c) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as, \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) read with regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) & (d), 4 (1) and 4 (2) (f), (k) & (r) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations, 2003\\\\\\\\u201d) and Noticees no. 2 to 5 were charged with the violations of Section 12A (a), (b) & (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3 (a), (b), (c) & (d) and 4 (1) of the SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003. The SCN called upon them to show cause as to why suitable directions shall not be issued against them under Sections 11, 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992.  6. From the available records, I note that the SCN was duly served upon all the Noticees except for Noticee no. 1. It is noted that pursuant to receipt of the SCN, a letter dated September 18, 2018 was submitted on behalf of Mr. Kaushik Bhatt (Noticee no. 4) stating that he is out of India and will be filing a detailed reply. Mr. Dinesh Patel     Order in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd. Page 4 of 44   (Noticee no. 5) has filed a written reply dated September 26, 2018 while Mr. Mukund Bakshi (Noticee no. 3) has made his written replies vide letters dated October 5, 2018 and November 5, 2018. Noticee no. 4 has also filed a short reply vide letter dated October 20, 2018 but has sought more time to file a detailed reply which he could not file on account of having met with an accident. I note that Mr. Kalpesh Patel (Noticee no. 2) and Noticee no. 3 have also sought inspection of documents and subsequently Noticee no. 3 has carried out inspection of the documents relied upon the SCN on February 26, 2019. Noticee no. 2 did not avail the opportunity to carry out the inspection of documents but has submitted his written reply to the SCN vide letter dated May 22, 2019. As mentioned above, the SCN could not be delivered to the Company and subsequently, it came to notice that the Company is in liquidation. In this regard, a letter was received by SEBI from the Office of Official Liquidator of the Company (for convenience \\\\\\\\u201cOL\\\\\\\\u201d) vide letter dated November 6, 2019 stating that since the cause of action and allegations in the present proceedings pertain to pre-liquidation period, the OL is not concerned about the same nor has any knowledge about the said matter, hence the ex-Directors may be contacted. 7. In compliance with the principles of natural justice, all the Noticees were provided with an opportunity of personal hearing before me on January 14, 2020. However, Noticees no. 3 and 4 requested for an adjournment of the personal hearing. Accordingly, the personal hearing of all the Noticees was adjourned to March 31, 2020. Noticee no. 4 again sought adjournment stating that he is unable to travel on account of COVID-19. Keeping in view the seriousness of the pandemic situation at that time, the personal hearing was adjourned and the next hearing was scheduled in the matter on June 4, 2020. Subsequently, another adjournment request was received from Noticee no. 4. The hearing was adjourned to August 4, 2020 qua him, whereas Noticees no. 3 and 5 duly attended the personal hearing through video-conference facility on June 4, 2020 and presented arguments based on their written replies submitted earlier in response to the SCN Later on, these two Noticees have also filed their post hearing submissions incorporating responses to certain queries put to them during the     Order in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd. Page 5 of 44   personal hearing. However, Noticee no. 4 vide email dated August 6, 2020 sought another date for personal hearing stating that he is old and not attending to work regularly and could not see the mail addressed to him intimating the hearing date in the matter. In the interest of justice, another opportunity of personal hearing was provided to him and to the Noticees no. 1 and 2 as well on September 29, 2020. On that date, the hearing was attended only by Noticee no. 4 through video conferencing. Subsequently, Noticee no. 4 vide letter dated September 30, 2020 and also vide email dated October 12, 2020 has submitted his post hearing submissions. With regard to the Noticees no. 1 and 2, I find that sufficient opportunities for personal hearing have been provided to them and considering the fact that no request of adjournment has been received from them, no useful purpose would be achieved by granting any more opportunity. Therefore, I deem it appropriate to proceed in the matter on the basis of materials available on record and replies filed by them, if any. 8. The explanations offered and arguments advanced by each of the Noticees through their Personal hearing as well as written replies have been perused. The contentions / submission of the Noticees are briefly summarised as below: Noticee no. 2 a) He was Promoter of the Company and on the Board of Directors from 1991 till May 2015. b) There is immense delay in issuing SCN and since the Company is in liquidation, he has no access to documents and many relevant persons have also left the Company.  c) SEBI has no jurisdiction over GDR issued in foreign jurisdiction unless the same has an adverse effect in Indian Securities Market, due to allied transactions in the underlying shares of GDR issue. The SCN does not make such allegation and GDR issue was compliant with Foreign laws, hence it is not SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s jurisdiction to allege that such scheme of issuance of GDR was fraudulent.     Order in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd. Page 6 of 44   d) GDR issue was done for financing the expansion needs of the Company (relating to carbon fibre production) and repayment of loans, hence they engaged a consultant who brought Vintage, an entity who was willing to subscribing to GDR issue of the Company. e) The Pledge Agreement was executed as per the advice of the consultant to the Board of Directors who advised that the same was compliant with all laws. Relevant disclosures about GDR issue have been made, therefore, as far as disclosure of Pledge Agreement is concerned, it becomes the discretion of the Board of Directors as to what needs to be disclosed. Noticee has further relied on Clause 36 of the Listing Agreement to further support his argument. f) The Noticee has admitted having signed the Pledge Agreement in furtherance of the authorization by the Board of Directors. He has not made any unlawful gain and has not sold shares even after price of the shares of the Company went high and rather he had bought shares subsequently. Noticee no. 3 g) He was appointed as an Independent/Non-Executive Director in 2004 and has resigned on August 28, 2010 owing to professional commitments and lack of time. He has enclosed Form 32 in support of his resignation. h) He was not involved in day to day affairs of the Company and was unable to attend the Board Meetings regularly and to the best of his knowledge, he did not attend meetings pertaining to GDR issue. i) The alleged fraudulent arrangement pertaining to GDR issue was not brought to his notice and he was not aware of the manipulative designs and was not part of discussions pertaining to signing of documents between Kemrock, Vintage and Euram Bank.     Order in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd. Page 7 of 44   j) He was informed by the Company that it is in the process of opening a bank account outside India with Euram Bank and that the copy of Board Resolution approving GDR issue and opening a bank account is to be certified by two Independent Directors as per the requirement of Euram Bank.  k) The said Board Resolution only authorised opening of account and to carry out transactions including offering of the funds as security. Accordingly, he had certified the copy of the Board Resolution in good faith believing that it was in the interest of the Company and it is generally found that the proceeds of issue are normally placed in short term deposit till actually required. l) Further, the Company Secretary of the Company has also certified the copy of Resolution and disclosures, if any, with respect to GDR issue and matters connected with Stock Exchanges were being made by the Company Secretary and other Executive officers of Kemrock. m) Noticee has sought information from Company, MD and OL vide several letters sent to them, however, no information has been received from them. He has not even received remuneration from the Company for attending any of the Board Meetings. Noticee no. 4 n) Noticee was a Non-Executive, Independent and Professional Director and was never looking after the day to day affairs of the Company and has never received any remuneration for being the Director of the Company. o) Noticee is a practicing lawyer and has joined the Company to look after certain legal proceedings against the Company. p)  Noticee has sought information from OL to provide the minutes of the Company, however, no information has been received by the Noticee. He has     Order in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd. Page 8 of 44   not even received remuneration from the Company for attending any of the Board Meetings. Noticee no. 5 q) Noticee is unaware of the Pledge Agreement or Loan Agreement and he was only aware of passing of the alleged Board Resolution and was merely certifying the copy in a mechanical/clerical manner. r) Noticee has submitted an affidavit vide letter dated August 17, 2020 wherein he has reiterated his ignorance about the Pledge Agreement or Loan Agreement as well as the alleged transactions entered into by the Company pursuant to the Board Resolution dated March 16, 2010, until receipt of SCN from SEBI. s) Role of the Noticee was limited to the secretarial functions of the Company and not connected with the management of the Company. He has relied on Section 54 of Companies Act, 1956 to emphasise that it is one of the most routine functions of a Company Secretary to issue copies of board Resolutions. ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS: 9. I have perused the SCN including all the annexures as referred to in the SCN, replies received from Noticees to the aforesaid SCNs, submissions made during the course of personal hearing and written submissions filed as well as all other relevant material available on record, and find that the following issues require consideration in this matter:  (i) Whether the Company i.e. Noticee no. 1 has violated Section 12A(a), (b), (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and 4 (1), 4 (2) (f), (k), (r) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003?  (ii) Whether the Noticees no. 2 to 5 have violated Section 12A(a), (b), (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and 4 (1) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003?     Order in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd. Page 9 of 44   ISSUE No. 1: Whether the Company i.e. Noticee no. 1 has violated Section 12A(a), (b), (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and 4 (1), 4 (2) (f), (k), (r) of the SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003? 10. Before I proceed to examine the afore-stated issues and decide as to whether on the facts of the matter, the aforesaid violations as alleged in SCN stand established or not, it would be proper to reproduce hereunder, the relevant provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the SEBI PFUTP Regulations, 2003 alleged to have been violated by the Noticees in the instant matter. The same are reproduced below: SEBI Act, 1992 12A.

As mentioned above, Noticee no. 1 (the Company) has neither submitted any reply to the SCN nor has appeared before me for personal hearing, despite being     Order in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd. Page 11 of 44   granted sufficient opportunity, hence, I find it proper to proceed in the matter qua Noticee no. 1 on the basis of material available before me and record my findings in the succeeding paragraphs. 12. As noted earlier, the Company had issued 4.83 million GDR on April 29, 2010 for raising USD 50.00 million and for this purpose, the Board of Kemrock had passed a Resolution in its Meeting held on March 16, 2010, wherein, inter alia, a decision was taken to open an account with Euram Bank for the purpose of depositing the GDR Proceeds therein and also to authorize Euram Bank to use the GDR proceeds as security against loan. Relevant extracts of the said Board Resolutions are as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cRESOLVED THAT a bank account of Kemrock Industries and Exports Limited (Company) be opened with EURAM Bank (\\\\\\\\u201cthe Bank\\\\\\\\u201d) or any branch of EURAM Bank, including the off-shore branch, outside India for the purpose of receiving subscription money in respect of the Global Depository Receipts issue (GDRs) of the Company. RESOLVED FURTHER THAT, Mr. Kalpesh Patel, the Chairman & Managing Director and Mr. Shailesh Patel, the Manager Accounts, the Authorized Signatories of the Company, be and are hereby severally authorized to sign, execute, any application, agreement, escrow agreement, document, undertaking, confirmation, declaration and other papers from time to time as may be required by the Bank and to carry and affix common seal of the Company thereon, if and when so required.  RESOLVED FURTHER THAT, Mr. Kalpesh Patel, the Chairman & Managing Director and Mr. Shailesh Patel, the Manager Accounts, the Authorized Signatories of the Company, be and are hereby severally authorized to draw cheques and other documents, and to give instructions from time to time as may be necessary to the said EURAM Bank or any of branch of EURAM Bank , including the off-shore branch, for the purpose of operation of and dealing with the said bank account and carry out other relevant and necessary transactions and generally to take all such steps and to do all such things as may be required from time to time on behalf of the Company.     Order in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd. Page 12 of 44   RESOLVED FURTHER THAT, the Bank be and is hereby authorized to use the funds so deposited in the aforesaid bank account as security in connection with loans if any as well as to enter into any Escrow Agreement or similar arrangements if and when so required.\\\\\\\\u201d (Emphasis supplied) 13. On a perusal of the aforesaid Board Resolutions (copy enclosed as annexure-4 to the SCN), I note that the said Resolutions were approved by the Board on March 16, 2010 for, inter alia, opening of a bank account with Euram Bank for the purpose of receiving subscription money in respect of the GDR issue of the Company. According to the Resolution, Noticee no. 2, Mr. Kalpesh Patel Chairman & Managing Director of the Company and another Mr. Shailesh Patel, Manager Accounts were authorized to sign, execute any application, agreement, etc., as may be required by the Euram Bank. Accordingly, the Company had opened an account no. 580020 in its name in Euram Bank. It was further resolved by the Board to authorize the Euram Bank to use the funds so deposited in the said bank account of the Company as security in connection with loans, if any. A comprehensive reading of all the above said Board Resolutions clearly suggest that a decision was taken by the Board of the Company as far back as on March 16, 2010, related to the proposed issuance of GDR, including a decision that was taken at that very stage itself to open a bank account with Euram Bank. Further, the Board had also contemplated on the date of passing of the said Resolutions itself, that the funds/proceeds of the proposed GDR issue to be received in their Euram Bank account, would be used as a security for loans by the Euram Bank. The said contemplation of using the GDR proceeds as security for loan was sans any reason and contrary to the commonly accepted commercial practise. No reasons have been assigned by the Company for passing such a resolution. Further, putting the GDR proceeds as a security against a loan clearly suggests that the Company did not have any need for the GDR proceeds to be put to immediate use for the objects for which the GDR were to be issued. On the one hand, the Company, instead of raising funds from the domestic sources, thought it proper to explore the possibility of raising funds offshore, while on the other hand, it did not seem to have any genuine intention     Order in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd. Page 13 of 44   to immediately use such funds for the business requirement of the Company. Apparently, this act of the Company gives an impression that the Company did not have any serious and urgent need of funds to meet its business requirement. In this regard, the SCN has brought to my notice that the information with regard to the aforesaid Board Resolutions, particularly the resolution for keeping the GDR proceeds as a security against loan if any, was never disclosed to the Stock Exchange or to the Shareholders of the Company, which amounted to concealing of such an important information from the knowledge of the shareholders and other domestic investors and consequently preventing them from taking an informed decision. 14. As noted in the beginning, Vintage had signed a Loan Agreement dated April 23, 2010 with Euram Bank for availing a loan of up to USD 50,000,137.6 so as to be in a position to subscribe to the full amount of the GDR issue of Kemrock worth of USD 50.00 million. It is also observed that Noticees have neither made any submission nor have they furnished any documents to establish that the said sole subscriber, i.e. Vintage was otherwise, (even in the absence of the said loan that was facilitated to it from Euram Bank by the Company), financially capable to subscribe to the entire GDR issue. In this regard it is pertinent to note some of the relevant clauses of the said Loan Agreement, which are cited as under:  \\\\\\\\u201c1. Currency and Amount of Facility  USD 50,000,137.6 2. Nature and Purpose of Facility To provide funding enabling Vintage FZE to take down GDR issue of 4,827,200 Luxembourg public offering and may only be transferred to EURAM account no. 580020, Kemrock Industries and Exports Limited.  3. Draw down     Order in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd.

From the above, I observe that apparently on the strength of the authorization given by the Board to that effect to \\\\\\\\u201cuse the funds so deposited in the aforesaid bank account as security in connection with loans if any\\\\\\\\u201d the Noticee no. 2, Mr. Kalpesh Patel, Chairman & Managing Director (CMD) of the Company had signed a Pledge Agreement with Euram Bank dated April 23, 2010 therein giving an undertaking on behalf of Kemrock, to deposit in the designated account of Kemrock with Euram Bank, an amount not exceeding the loan availed by Vintage for subscribing to the GDR of Kemrock and further to keep the deposited amount as a security against the loan obligations of     Order in the matter of Kemrock Industries & Exports Ltd.

BRIA is a company having CIN: U74999MP2017PTC042843 and its directors are Ashif Shaikh, Vinit Satpute and Sandeep Kushwaha.   2. SEBI has received complaints in SCORES against BRIA. The complainants alleged that the IA was offering assured returns and that they incurred loss due to inappropriate advice given by BRIA, IA was taking Payments in the name of family members, taking payments without due\\\\\\\\u2013diligence on risk appetite and financial condition, not refunding the service charges, etc. In view of the complaints received, SEBI conducted an examination in relation to the affairs of BRIA. The examination entailed, inter alia, an analysis of the details available on the website of BRIA, complaints filed by the complainants against BRIA and documents attached with complaints such as Risk Profiling Form (\\\\\\\\u201cRPF\\\\\\\\u201d), KYC, Invoices/Receipts issued to clients, etc. Based on the examination of documents / information provided by BRIA and complainants, SEBI prima facie observed the following: 2.1 BRIA had offered assured returns/target returns to its clients and violated provisions of SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIA Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d);  2.2 BRIA had not carried out risk profiling and suitability assessment of clients as per the provisions of IA Regulations. 2.3 BRIA had violated the provisions of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d)__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited    Page 3 of 25  CONSIDERATION & PRIMA FACIE FINDINGS  3.

ISSUE NO. 1: Whether BRIA has prima facie violated any provisions of IA Regulations?     5. Assured Returns:  5.1 It is noted from the invoices submitted by BRIA and by the complainant that the IA has offered Targeted Returns in absolute monetary terms to the complainant and his family members and the service tenure of the product/service is linked to the said target. For instance, in one of the Invoice/Payment receipt issued by BRIA to its client Mr. Yagnesh Rawal, the service offered was Platinum Fortune Service (Cash) and payment of Rs. 92,311.50/- was received. In the same Invoice, BRIA mentioned that \\\\\\\\u201cTarget (Not Guaranteed/Not Assured) is Rs. 26,00,000\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, the said Invoice also mentioned the service tenure as \\\\\\\\u201c249-899 Trading Sessions or Target as mentioned in Point no.14 whichever occurs earlier\\\\\\\\u201d   5.2 Following table depicts such instances of target returns promised in the payment receipts/ Invoices of the clients: Target Returns Promised to the Clients  Client Name Proposed investment as per Risk Profile  Payment date Name of the service  Target Return (in Rs) Service Fee (in Rs) Exclusive of GST (18%) Mr. Yagnesh Rawal < 1Lac 07/01/2019 Platinum Fortune Service (Cash) 26,00,000 92,311.50 Mr. Yagnesh Rawal < 1Lac 08/01/2019 Platinum Fortune Service (Cash) 26,00,000 1,35,593.20__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited    Page 7 of 25  Mr. Yagnesh Rawal < 1Lac 09/01/2019 Platinum Fortune Service (Cash) 26,00,000 1,18,471.20 Mr. Yagnesh Rawal < 1Lac 11/01/2019 Fortune Platinum Stock (Cash) 26,00,000 2,99,000.00 Mr. Yagnesh Rawal < 1Lac 23/04/2019 Superb Premium Cash 8,97,500 2,99,000.00 Total <5 Lac   1,12,97,500 9,44,375.90  Mr. Paras Rawal 1-2 Lac 21/01/2019 Fortune Platinum (Stock Options) 19,50,000 6,50,000 Mr. Paras Rawal 1-2 Lacs 10/05/2019 Elite Premium Future Service 17,46,500 4,23,729 Total 2-4 Lacs   36,96,500 10,73,729  Mr. Janak Rawal 1-2 Lacs 26/04/2019 Elite Premium Services(Stock Cash) 17,46,500 4,21,500  Mrs. Devilaben Rawal 1-2 Lacs 21/01/2019 Fortune Platinum (Stock options) 26,00,000 6,50,000 Mrs. Devilaben Rawal 1-2 Lacs 29/01/2019 Superb Platinum (Stock Cash) 8,97,000 2,33,052 Mrs. Devilaben Rawal 1-2 Lacs 10/05/2019 Rapid Premium Future Service 4,97,500 1,62,489 Total 3-6 Lacs   39,94,500 10,45,541  5.3 Though, BRIA has mentioned the amount of Rs. 26 lacs as \\\\\\\\u2018not guaranteed/not assured\\\\\\\\u2019, BRIA has specified the said amount as the target. Though the BRIA states that the target is not guaranteed/not assured, the fact that the service is promised to continue till the target is achieved, indicates an assurance that the target would be achieved. Further, there appears to be no basis for indicating the target amount as Rs.26,00,000/-, especially when the proposed investment amount is less than Rupees One lakh. Similarly, BRIA has indicated a target return of Rs.17,46,500/- to Mr.Janak Rawal on a proposed investment amount of Rs.1-2 lakh.  5.4 BRIA being a SEBI registered intermediary, is well aware that any form of returns, whether targeted/assured, cannot be committed or indicated for any investment service/__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited    Page 8 of 25  product since all investments in the securities market are subject to market risks. There may be a scenario where the capital deployed by the investor gets eroded as the investment advice provided by BRIA turns out to be incorrect due to market risk.  Even if there are disclaimers, its conduct of mentioning \\\\\\\\u201ctargeted\\\\\\\\u201d returns belie its actual intent and acts as an implied assurance that client will achieve the particular return mentioned as \\\\\\\\u2018Target\\\\\\\\u2019 by acting upon the investment advice given by BRIA. If its objective was not to mislead investors, it should not have made such reckless and careless claims. Further, I note that the commitment to the client that the service offered will continue till the \\\\\\\\u2018targeted return\\\\\\\\u2019 is achieved tantamount to offering an implied assurance/guarantee of return on investments made by the clients.  5.5 Every investment in the market is subject to market risk and any investment made by the client can also run into losses and even become zero. Considering the dynamics of the market, the returns from the investment in the market are unpredictable, no matter how much and for how long the investment is made. Any information that puts out for the consumption of its existing and prospective clients has to be done with great responsibility and should be of such  nature that it enables investors to take reasoned and unbiased decisions regarding their investment  This act of the IA is nothing but prima facie appears to be an attempt to induce the client to subscribe to its advisory service by showing profit numbers which prima facie is an act to mislead the client as full disclosure is not made by the IA that the proposed investment of the client may incur loss.   This act prima facie, appears to have done with an intention to bring in more customers and thereby increasing the income of the IA.  5.6 The above conduct on the part of BRIA is not in the best interest of the clients. In view of the above, BRIA has prima facie failed in its responsibility to act in fiduciary capacity to its clients which is entrusted upon him under regulation 15 (1) of IA Regulations. Such implied assurance of target returns indicates that the BRIA, prima facie, failed to act honestly, fairly and in the best interests of its clients and in the integrity of the market. Therefore, BRIA has prima facie failed to abide by Clauses 1 and 2 of Code of Conduct for Investment Advisors as specified in Schedule III of IA Regulations read with regulation 15 (9) of IA Regulations.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited    Page 9 of 25   6. BRIA has taken payment before doing KYC and Risk Profiling of clients.   6.1 Regulation 16 of IA Regulations states that IA shall carry out risk profiling of the client for ascertaining client\\\\\\\\u2019s risk tolerance, income, loss absorbing capacity, capacity of accepting loss of capital, liabilities/borrowing, etc. Further, it also states that the risk profiling should be communicated to the client after risk assessment is done. It is noted that the primary purpose of the same is that the respective client is given an opportunity to assess/be satisfied with his risk profile before agreeing to accept the advice for products/services.   6.2 Regulation 17 of IA Regulations, inter alia, states that all investments on which investment advice is provided is appropriate to the risk profile of the client. It should be, inter-alia, based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment objectives and his financial situation. Further, the investment advice should be such that the client is able to bear any related investment risks consistent with its investment objectives and risk tolerance.  6.3 It is noted from the documents obtained from the complainant and BRIA that it has received part payments for the products/services even before KYC and Risk profiling has been done. The details of such instances are brought out as below:  Sl. No. Date of Payment in Invoice Amount (including GST) as per Invoice in Rs.

In some cases, the difference between the date on which payment was received and risk profiling was done, was more than two months. It appears that the same has been done by BRIA to earn advisory fees / profits by selling products without caring for the needs of the clients. As per regulations 16(a),16(b)(ii) read with regulation 17(a) of IA Regulations, rendering of Investment Advice shall be done only after obtaining information from the client for carrying out his risk profiling, identifying whether client is unwilling or unable to accept the loss of capital for ensuring that investment advice provided is appropriate to the risk profile of the client. In the case of BRIA, it is seen that the package/service (suitability) is decided upfront and fee is collected even before doing the KYC and the risk profiling. Therefore, from the above it is prima facie found that the products sold by BRIA to its clients could be completely inappropriate to the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 need, as the risk profiling has not been completed for the client before selling the product. Thereby, IA has not acted with due skill, care, diligence, honesty and in the best interest of its clients while selling investment advice appropriate to the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 risk profile and had also failed to seek information from its clients about their financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives before selling them certain investment advices / services. 6.5 In view of the above, BRIA has prima facie (a) failed to sell the investment advice appropriate to the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 risk profile in accordance with regulation 16(a),16(b)(ii) read with regulation 17(a) of IA Regulations and (b) failed to abide by clauses 1, 2 and 4 of Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Therefore, I find that BRIA has prima facie violated the provisions of regulation 16(a), 16(b)(ii) and 17(a) of IA Regulations__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited    Page 11 of 25  and clauses 1, 2 and 4 of Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations.   7. BRIA is not doing Risk Profiling and Suitability of the clients appropriately:  7.1 From the documents obtained from the complainant and from BRIA, it is noted that the Risk Profiling has not been done appropriately and products/services were offered without assessing the appropriate risk bearing capacity of the clients. In RPF of clients, BRIA has recorded contradictory answers of the risk assessment questions. Some of the questions in the Risk Profile Forms (RPF) of Mr. Yagnesh Rawal and his family members are reproduced below:  Question Answer Yagnesh Rawal Experience in Market Products ?

Low Proposed Investment Amount 1-2 Lac__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited    Page 13 of 25   7.2 It is noted from the response to the question in RPF \\\\\\\\u2018What is your experience in Equity/Commodity/Forex\\\\\\\\u2019 markets, all the clients have responded that they had no experience in Equity, Commodity and Forex markets. Further, it is noted from the same RPF documents that the clients have responded to the question \\\\\\\\u2018Experience in Market Products\\\\\\\\u2019 as \\\\\\\\u2018Stock and/or Derivatives\\\\\\\\u2019. It shows that the responses recorded by BRIA are contradictory and demonstrates that BRIA has not done adequate due diligence in the process of risk profiling.   7.3 Further, it is also observed from the RPF documents of the clients that all the entities have responded to the question \\\\\\\\u2018Risk Tolerance\\\\\\\\u2019 as \\\\\\\\u2018low\\\\\\\\u2019. However, it is observed from the invoices raised by BRIA that the clients Risk Profile has been mentioned as \\\\\\\\u2018HIGH\\\\\\\\u2019 i.e. the assessment of the risk taking capacity of the clients based on the weights allotted by BRIA is categorized as \\\\\\\\u2018HIGH\\\\\\\\u2019 by BRIA.   Suitability   7.4  I note that IA shall ensure that all investments on which investment advice is provided is appropriate to the risk profile of the client. IA should also have documented process for selecting investments based on the client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment objectives and financial situation. It understands the nature and risks of products or assets selected for clients.  7.5 However, in the present case it is noted that BRIA is taking a \\\\\\\\u2018Suitability Assessment\\\\\\\\u2019 declaration from its clients which appears to be in the nature of waiver.  The same is reproduced as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cSuitability Assessment \\\\\\\\uf0b7 \"Despite of your Age, Income and Occupation, you with your free consent have agreed to work in high risk profile services  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It is clearly been communicated to you that high risk profile services may be more risky but you still has opted that.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited    Page 14 of 25  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In case you disagree with the suitability assessment done. kindly revert us back with your disconsent else it will be assumed as accepted & suitable for you in case you fail to revert us back with your disconsent within 24 hours.  Note: You with your free consent & sound state of mind accept the services & willingly want to work upon our services despite of your age and risk profile\\\\\\\\u2019\\\\\\\\u2019   7.6 I note that the obligation to ensure suitability of service is imposed by virtue of the IA Regulations, on the IA.  Reg. 17(e) further places an obligation on the IA while giving a recommendation for buy, to ensure that the recommendation is   consistent   with   clients experience, knowledge, investment objectives, risk appetite and capacity for absorbing loss. The suitability of advice, in this regard, among other things, is dependent on the proper assessment of risk. Such risk assessment is dependent on, inter alia, on both subjective criteria and objective criteria. For instance, Reg 16(b) insists upon a process for assessment of risk which the client is willing to take (subjective criteria) and able to take (objective criteria). There may be cases where the client is willing to accept the risk of capital (subjective criteria), however, he may not have the capacity to absorb the loss (objective criteria).  The perusal of clause 17(e) of IA Regulations on suitability requirement, indicates that the recommendation has to consistent with his \\\\\\\\u201ccapacity for absorbing loss\\\\\\\\u201d (objective criteria) and appropriate with the risk profile of the client (Reg 17(a)) which can include the willingness to take risk (subjective criteria).   However, such blanket waivers as in this case, only nullifies the protection given to the investors by mandating the IA to follow the mix of mandatory criteria and subjective criteria for selection of suitable products. Therefore, seeking the blanket waivers directly go against the obligation to ensure \\\\\\\\u201csuitability\\\\\\\\u201d, since the advice given on the basis of waiver relies upon solely the subjective willingness of the investor/client. I note that other than this the IA Regulations do not envisage complete waiver of suitability requirement through \\\\\\\\u2018waiver clauses\\\\\\\\u2019.  7.7 From the above, it is prima facie found that BRIA has not done any due-diligence with respect to the Risk Profiling and Suitability Assessment of the clients. The IA has recorded responses in the RPF which are contradictory and offered services/products on suitability waivers being taken from the clients rather than conducting an objective assessment of the__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited    Page 15 of 25  risk appetite of its clients. It appears that BRIA has taken the Risk Profiling and Suitability Exercise as enumerated in IA Regulations as mere formality and did not follow the procedure as envisaged in regulation 16 and 17 of IA Regulations. It is also prima facie found that by not carrying out Risk Profiling of clients and suitability assessment of services appropriately, BRIA failed to act with due skill, care, diligence, honesty, fairness and in the best interest of its clients while selling products/services to its clients. In view of the same, BRIA has prima facie (a) failed to carry out Risk Profiling of clients in accordance with Regulation 16 of IA Regulations and (b) failed to carry out risk suitability assessment of services provided to its clients in accordance with Regulation 17 of IA Regulations. Therefore, I, prima facie find that BRIA has violated Regulations 16 and 17 of IA Regulations.   ISSUE No. 2:  Whether BRIA has, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act read with PFUTP Regulations? 8. In the instant matter, it is prima facie found that: 8.1 BRIA has been providing assurance of target or approachable profit to the clients and is providing commitment to continue its service of providing recommendations till the time the target or implied assurance of profit is achieved. 8.2 BRIA had sold its advisory products and collected fees from the clients, even before it had carried out the KYC and risk profile for its clients. In some cases, the difference between the date on which payment was received and risk profiling was done, was more than two months. 8.3 Risk Profiling has not been done appropriately and products/services were offered without assessing the appropriate risk bearing capacity of the clients. In RPF of clients, BRIA has recorded contradictory answers of the risk assessment questions without due diligence.  8.4  BRIA has relied upon waiver of suitability of products/services rather than truly assessing the clients age, income, financial condition, eligibility to trade, investment objectives and suitability of various products.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Bull Research Investment Advisors Private Limited    Page 16 of 25  9.

The total credit received in the aforesaid bank accounts including PayUmoney gateway is approximately Rs. 2,02,76,579/- during the period January 28, 2016 to  December 15, 2020.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Simply Earn Research                                                                                       Page 8 of 19 10. Further, I note that the partnership deed between Mr. Animesh Parida and Mr. Parth R Trivedi was executed on January 12, 2016. As per the said Partnership deed, the business shall be carried on in the name of \\\\\\\\u201cSimply Earn Research\\\\\\\\u2019 and nature of business is to promote and act as or carry on the business of consultants, advisers or perform any kind of roles as an intermediary or advisor in securities market.   11. In light of the aforesaid discussions, I prima facie observe that SER has been putting the information in public domain / advertising by using website namely www.simplyearnreasearch.com  about the various services offered by them in securities market. It is also prima facie observed that various plans / packages are being offered by SER to avail their services. Thus, I prima facie observe, that SER is prima facie, holding itself out as an investment adviser. In view of the above facts and circumstances, especially the content of the website coupled with the credit transactions in the bank accounts and nature of business mentioned in the partnership deed, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees / funds credited to the bank accounts, were for the purpose of availing the services indicated on the website of SER and is carrying out services related to investments in securities market as mentioned in website and acting as advisor in securities market from January 12, 2016.   12. In this regard, I have perused the definition of investment adviser as given in regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, which states that investment adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have also perused the Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines investment advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Simply Earn Research                                                                                       Page 9 of 19 13. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is, prima facie noted, from the contents of the website of SER and nature of business mentioned in the partnership deed, that SER is prima facie, holding itself out as investment adviser by offering to provide services related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription and these services fall within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Advice\\\\\\\\u201d under Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations. Further, multiple credit entries have been received in the bank accounts, which when seen together with the contents of the website, leads to, on preponderance of probability basis, a prima facie, conclusion that the credit entries in the bank account are consideration for the investment advice given by SER to its clients. Thus, prima facie, SER is an investment adviser as defined under Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations.  14. The fact that SER is offering various subscription packages in various segments of the market viz, equity, derivatives and commodity, when seen in light of the receipt of money in its bank accounts, prima facie shows, on preponderance of probability basis, that the credit of money is in fact the fee for the investment advisory services rendered by SER. Therefore, SER has not only held itself out as investment adviser but has also acted as an investment adviser for consideration.  ISSUE No. 2:  If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether SER has, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act read with IA Regulations?   15. In order to ensure that investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of SEBI Act states that  \\\\\\\\u201cNo  stock  broker,  sub -broker,  share  transfer  agent,  banker  to  an  issue,  trustee  of  trust deed,  registrar  to  an  issue,  merchant  banker,  underwriter,  portfolio  manager,  investment adviser  and  such  other  intermediary  who  may  be  associated  with  securities  market  shall  buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration  obtained  from  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the regulations  made under  this Act\\\\\\\\u201d__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Simply Earn Research                                                                                       Page 10 of 19 16. Further, Regulation 3(1) of the IA regulations, states that \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.   17. Thus, as per Section 12(1) of SEBI Act and Regulation 3(1) of IA Regulations, any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI regulations i.e. the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory.   18. The activities of SER, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions shows that SER is holding itself out as investment advisers and is acting as investment advisers. However, no material was available on record to indicate that SER or its partners Mr. Animesh Parida and Mr. Parth R Trivedi in their individual capacity had a certificate of registration as an Investment Adviser. In this context, it is noted that SER, Mr. Animesh Parida and Mr. Parth R Trivedi in their individual capacity are not registered with SEBI as an intermediary. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by SER, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, leads to the conclusion that SER is holding itself out and acting as investment advisers without a certificate of registration from SEBI. In my view, these activities/ representations of SER are, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.  ISSUE NO. 3:  If answers to Issue Nos. 1 & 2 are affirmative, who are responsible for the violations?  19. I note that SER, prima facie, is carrying out unregistered investment advisory from January 12, 2016 till date.   20. As per Section 25 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cIPA\\\\\\\\u201d), \\\\\\\\u201cevery partner is liable jointly with all the other partners and also severally, for all acts of__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Simply Earn Research                                                                                       Page 11 of 19 the firm done while he is a partner\\\\\\\\u201d. Section 25 of IPA deals with situations where the act of the firm has caused loss / injury to a third party. In this regard, reference can be also  made to Sections 26, 27, 45, 48(b)(i) and 49 of IPA which deal with the liability of the firm towards third parties. The liability of acting partners and non-acting partners (collectively known as firm) for the injury to the third party is an outcome of joint and several liability of such partners under IPA, irrespective of the fact that the conduct (act of the firm) which gave rise to the loss/injury to the third party falls within the violation of four corners of any provision under securities law.   21. However, a partner who indulges in such conduct / omission, is also liable under securities laws, if his act/omission falls within the violation of four corners of any provision under securities law. In addition to that, I note for the contravention of law committed by the firm, apart from the firm, the partners of firm who at the time of contravention, were having knowledge of the said contravention or the partners whose neglect contributes to the contravention of law, are also liable for said contravention of law committed by the firm. The said principle is embodied in Sections 27(1) and 27(2) of SEBI Act.  22.   I note from the partnership deed dated January 12, 2016 that following are the partners of the firm: Sl. No. Name of the Partner Tenure 1 Mr. Animesh Parida  January 12, 2016 - till date 2 Mr. Parth R Trivedi   23. From the Partnership deed, it is noted that nature of business of SER is to promote and act as an intermediary or advisor in securities market and both the partners namely Mr. Animesh Parida and Mr. Parth R Trivedi shall be the managing / working partner and shall be actively engaged in the conduct of the affairs of the business of SER. Thus, all the above shows that, prima facie, unregistered investment adviser activities carried out by SER, are prima facie, under management of both the partners namely Mr. Animesh Parida and Mr. Parth R Trivedi. Thus, Mr. Animesh Parida and Mr. Parth R Trivedi being the working/acting partners are,__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Simply Earn Research                                                                                       Page 12 of 19 prima facie, liable for the violations under the provisions of Section 27(1) of SEBI Act and consequently for refund as well.  24. I also note that the liability of the partners also arises if the offence/ contravention is attributable to any neglect on the part of them. There is no material on record to, prima facie, indicate that the partners in the instant case have taken any steps to prevent SER from committing the violations, prima facie, observed against SER. Therefore, both the partners are, prima facie, liable under this ground also for the violations of the firm and consequently for refund as well.   25. In view of Section 25 of IPA and Section 27 of SEBI Act, they are, prima facie, liable jointly and severally with the firm for refund of the fee collected by SER. In addition to that, in view of Section 27 of SEBI Act,  Mr. Animesh Parida and Mr. Parth R Trivedi are prima facie, jointly and severally liable with SER for unregistered investment adviser activities for their respective terms as partners for contravention of provisions of SEBI Act and IA Regulations by SER.   ISSUE NO. 4:  If answer to Issue No. 2 is in affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any should be issued against those responsible for the violations?  26. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of regulating investment advisory activities to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of investment advisory activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations inter alia seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Simply Earn Research                                                                                       Page 13 of 19 27. In the instant case, it is noted that Noticees are soliciting and inducing the investors to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips, intra-day calls etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration as mandated under the IA Regulations. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Noticees, from collecting any more fees from the public and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. It is noted from material available on record that transaction took place in the bank account of SER as recently as on December 05, 2020 in ICICI Bank,   and on December 14, 2020 in PayU money payment gateway. Moreover, the website of SER, www.simplyearnreasearch.com, is still active. Furthermore, the details of SER including its location, email (enquiry can be sent to SER by an email) and telephone number are mentioned on its aforementioned website. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Noticees in the securities market is still in existence and imminent. The total amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by SER is Rs. 2,02,76,579/- and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.  28. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from the unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from unregistered investment advisor not in consonance with the IA Regulations vis-a-vis an investor who receives such service from registered investment adviser following the IA Regulations stands in a disadvantageous position in respect of  his protection as investor as envisaged under the IA regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not even satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment adviser. Availing of service from such person is detrimental to investors and such unqualified service can result in irreparable detriment as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victim of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury to the development of the securities market also qualifies as \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable detriment\\\\\\\\u201d as the objective of SEBI as__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Simply Earn Research                                                                                       Page 14 of 19 enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market.  29. Further, if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may subscribe by parting with significant fees and may cause irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is right of the current entity herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the \\\\\\\\u201cex-parte orders in the case of private suits\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cex-parte public enforcement actions\\\\\\\\u201d, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential loss of investment by the investors by following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if prima facie unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing an exparte-interim order at this stage.

From the narrative of the transactions, it appears that the payments have, prima facie, come from various investors / clients. An illustrative list of narrations in the bank account of the companies is as under:_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited                                                                                                                                    Page 8 of 30   Transaction Date Narration Credit (Rs.)

In light of the aforesaid discussions, I prima facie observe based on the contents of companies\\\\\\\\u2019 website wherein various services offered by the companies have been described, that the aforesaid three companies are prima facie, holding themselves out as investment advisers. Further, it is also prima facie, observed from the companies\\\\\\\\u2019 webpages that they offer various tips / services to their clients in the securities market through 24x7 support and SMS. Considering the above facts and circumstances, especially the content of the website of the companies coupled with the credit transactions in their bank accounts and payment gateway, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees / funds credited to their bank accounts, were for the purpose of availing the services indicated on their websites.  7. In this factual context, I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in regulation 2(m) of IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited                                                                                                                                    Page 9 of 30   8. In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is observed from the contents of the website of the companies that the companies are prima facie, holding themselves out as investment advisers by offering to provide investment advice as defined under regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations by offering to give advice related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and are also offering various investment packages for subscription. Further, as noted from their bank accounts that there are multiple credit entries which when seen together with the contents of the websites leads to the prima facie conclusion that the credit entries in their bank accounts are consideration for the investment advice given by the companies to their clients. Thus, prima facie, the companies are investment advisers as defined under regulation 2 (m) of IA Regulations.  9. Further, the fact that the companies in their MoU have stated carrying on business of advisory services in the field of equity, derivatives, mutual funds, commodities, etc. as one of the objects of the companies coupled with the various subscription packages offered by the companies in various segments of the market, when seen in light of the receipt of money in their bank accounts, prima facie shows, on preponderance of probability basis, that the credit of money is in fact the fee for the investment advisory services rendered by the companies. Therefore, the companies have not only held themselves out as investment advisers but have also acted as investment advisers for consideration. Issue No. 2: If answer to aforesaid issue is in the affirmative, whether Vishwas, Dalal and Devki have, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act read with IA Regulations and provisions of PFUTP Regulations? 10. In order to ensure that investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of SEBI Act reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited                                                                                                                                    Page 10 of 30   of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d Further, as per regulation 3(1) of IA Regulations, the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.  11. The activities of the companies, as brought out from the various materials described earlier, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that the companies were holding themselves out as investment advisers and also have been acting as investment advisers. However, no material is available on record to indicate that the companies have certificates of registration as investment adviser in their name (body corporate). In this context, it is noted that the companies are not registered with SEBI in any capacity. However, from the material made available on record it is noted that one of the common Directors in the three companies, namely Mr. Himanshu Bharatkumar Bhavsar has a SEBI certificate of registration as an investment adviser (INA000011501; August 23, 2018). In this regard, it is prima facie, observed that Mr. Himanshu Bharatkumar Bhavsar was acting as an unregistered investment advisor prior to grant of registration from SEBI. As observed in preceding paragraphs, the websites of the aforesaid three companies started operating from April 27, 2018 prior to him making an application for registration to SEBI. Mr. Himanshu Bharatkumar Bhavsar has prima facie, provided a false declaration in Form-A to SEBI while applying for registration as IA and was prima facie, conducting unregistered IA activities prior to getting SEBI registration. A total amount of Rs. 9,76,298/- has been prima facie, collected by him from clients for offering investment advice prior to SEBI registration and the said amount has been received in the aforementioned bank accounts of the three companies. 12. In this regard, I note that the present matter is with respect to the prima facie unregistered investment advisory activity carried out by the three companies. As per regulation 6 (a) of IA Regulations which deals with \\\\\\\\u201cConsideration of application and eligibility criteria\\\\\\\\u201d, there are two kind of applicants envisaged under IA Regulations; one_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited                                                                                                                                    Page 11 of 30   is an individual and the other is a body corporate or a firm. The same is also reflected in the Form A which is the form for application for grant of certificate of registration. In the said form, under the section \\\\\\\\u201cDetails of Applicant (provide details of only the section applicable to you)\\\\\\\\u201d, the details of individual and body corporate / firm are segregated. Credence to the aforesaid differentiation is further evident from the provision of regulation 8 of IA Regulations which deals with \\\\\\\\u201cCapital Adequacy\\\\\\\\u201d requirement. For an individual the value of net tangible assets should not be less than one lakh rupees whereas for a body corporate, its net worth should not be less than twenty five lakh rupees as per the extant laws. Even the fees at the time of application and at the time of grant or renewal that has to paid to SEBI under regulation 9 of IA Regulations is different for an individual and a body corporate. Moreover, under IA Regulations, there is a separate onus laid upon a body corporate / firm to appoint a Compliance Officer under regulation 20 of IA Regulations which is not on an individual acting as an investment adviser. Thus, from the aforesaid reading of various provisions of IA Regulations, it is clear that there is a distinct set of procedures and obligations on a body corporate, as compared to an individual if a body corporate wishes to carry out the business of investment advisory under its name and seal. In other words, it has to apply for a certificate in its own name to carry out investment advisory activities and comply with all the regulatory requirements as a body corporate investment advisor.  13. It has been discussed in the preceding issue that the characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by the companies, prima facie, leads to the conclusion that the companies are holding themselves out and acting as an investment adviser without a certificate of registration from SEBI in their name. In my view, these activities/ representations of the companies are, prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations. 14. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the provisions of Sections 12A (a), (b), (c) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) and regulations 4(1) and 4(2)(k) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (\\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d). The text of the aforesaid provisions is reproduced below:_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited                                                                                                                                    Page 12 of 30   SEBI Act Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control Section 12A: No person shall directly or indirectly:   (a)  use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;  (b)  employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange; (c) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; PFUTP Regulations Regulation 3.

Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited                                                                                                                                    Page 13 of 30   (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following, namely:- \\\\\\\\u2026 (k) an advertisement that is misleading or that contains information in a distorted manner and which may influence the decision of the investors\\\\\\\\u201d. 15. It is noted from the webpages of the companies that they have mentioned SEBI Registered No. INA000011501 therein. However, as noted in preceding paragraphs, none of the companies in their capacity as a body corporate have obtained a certificate of registration from SEBI as an investment adviser. Thus, it is prima facie observed that by displaying SEBI registration number on their website, which pertains to one of its Directors, the companies are prima facie misleading the investors by claiming to be a registered intermediary with SEBI. The information related to SEBI registration number, was not qualified; that the registration pertains to one of its Directors and not to the company. In the absence of any qualification, considering that the website belongs to the company, it is prima facie observed that a reasonable person / investor will understand / gather that the registration pertains to the company. In other words, the companies are claiming / representing themselves to be registered with SEBI as investment advisory companies which follow all the norms made by SEBI for corporate body investment advisors, for investor protection. Thus, prima facie, it appears that the companies are knowingly concealing the fact that they are not registered with SEBI as investment advisors and are also making representations knowing them to be false, thereby luring and inducing investors to deal in securities.  16. The above discussed act of the companies is prima facie, fraudulent and is covered under the definition of 'fraud' defined under regulation 2(1)(c) of PFUTP Regulations which reads as under: \\\\\\\\u201cfraud\\\\\\\\u201d includes any act, expression, omission or concealment committed whether in a deceitful manner or not by a person or by any other person with his connivance or by his agent while dealing in securities in order to induce another person or his agent to deal in securities, whether or not there is any wrongful gain or avoidance of any loss, and shall also include--_____________________________________________________________________________________________", "Date": "2021-01-25", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Interim Order in the matter of Vishwas Stocks Research Private Limited, Dalal Stocks Advisory Private Limited and Devki Stocks Private Limited [SAT Appeal No.: 196/2021]", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jan-2021/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-vishwas-stocks-research-private-limited-dalal-stocks-advisory-private-limited-and-devki-stocks-private-limited_48899.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 59063, "unique_record_id": "e0f4347fadSEBI20210125", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6680e8fd7858910306471c0c", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 05:10:47", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Fraud - Unregistered", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "No financial penalties mentioned.", "gpt_audience": "- Investors\n- Regulatory authorities (e.g., SEBI)\n- Legal professionals\n- Financial advisors\n- Company directors and officers\n- Shareholders\n- Compliance officers\n- Financial journalists and analysts", "gpt_segmentation": null, "gpt_individuals": "1.

In respect of: Avlokan Dealcom Pvt Ltd PAN: AALCA1583G  (CIN: U51909WB2012PTC179316)  In the matter of Radford Global Ltd.  FACTS OF THE CASE  1. Based on certain preliminary findings in regard to the preferential allotment of shares in the scrip of Radford Global Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018RGL\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018Company\\\\\\\\u2019), Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) passed two separate interim orders dated December 19, 2014 and November 09, 2015 in the matter. Thereafter, SEBI received reference from Principal Directors of Income Tax, Kolkata, Delhi and Chandigarh as well as from Financial Intelligence Unit. Based on these data, SEBI conducted investigation in the trading in the scrip of RGL for the period of    Page 2 of 12  February 27, 2012 to March 24, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Investigation Period\\\\\\\\u2019/\\\\\\\\u2018IP\\\\\\\\u2019) to ascertain whether there were any violations of the provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) by certain entities. 2. The company was originally incorporated in 1994 under the name Rosette Resorts Limited. Thereafter, the company changed its name to P.S. Global Ltd in the year 2011 and to Radford Global Limited in the year 2012. The company is engaged in the business of construction and real estate, textile, chemicals, trading in securities markets and manpower recruitment services. RGL was listed on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on June 20, 1995. 3. On the basis of investigation conducted by SEBI for the transactions in the scrip of RGL, it is inter-alia alleged that, Avlokan Dealcom Pvt Ltd (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019) had violated the provisions of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of SEBI Act read with Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a) & (e) of PFUTP Regulations. APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 4. The undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer, vide Order dated March 23, 2018 under Section 19 read with Section 15-I(1) of the SEBI Act read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) to inquire into and adjudge under the provisions of Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, the alleged    Page 3 of 12  violations of the relevant provisions of SEBI Act read with PFUTP Regulations by the Noticee. SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING:  5. A common show cause notice ref. SEBI/EAD/KS/MKG/31178/2018 dated November 02, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued, inter-alia, to the Noticee, under the provisions of Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules, to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against him and why penalty, if any, should not be imposed on him under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act for alleged violation of the relevant provisions of law. 6. The said SCN was sent through Speed Post with Acknowledgement Due at its address as per the records, however, the same returned undelivered with the caption \\\\\\\\u201cNo such consignee in this address.\\\\\\\\u201d Accordingly, in terms of Rule 7(c) of the Adjudication Rules, the SCN was sent for affixture at the address of the Noticee. As per the available records, I note from the affixture report dated February 02, 2019, that the SCN was pasted at the address of the Noticee, however no witness were available at the time of affixture; further it was recorded in the affixture report that the company was not available at the said address. Further, a copy of the unserved SCN was uploaded in the section \\\\\\\\u201cUnserved Summons / Notices\\\\\\\\u201d in the SEBI website. As the SCN issued to several other Noticees in the matter had returned undelivered from the respective addresses, it was decided to publish public notice in respect of such Noticees, including the present Noticee. Accordingly, the details of the unserved SCN was published in the Hindustan Times / Times of India on August 10, 2020.    Page 4 of 12  However, no reply to the SCN was received from the Noticee. Subsequently, the Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing on October 05, 2020. The details of the same were published vide public notice on September 16, 2020 in The Statesman. However, no reply was received from the Noticee nor did the Noticee appeared for the said hearing. 7. In view of the above, I am compelled to proceed in the matter against the Noticee ex parte. I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been complied with since sufficient opportunities have been provided to the Noticee to submit reply and to appear for hearing, which the Noticee has failed to avail of. Therefore, the present proceedings against the Noticee are undertaken ex-parte on the basis of available documents and information.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS: 8. I have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, and the material available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are : a. Whether the Noticee, by his trades, has resulted in false and misleading appearance of trading as well as contributed to the price in the scrip of RGL (during patch 2) and, therefore, has violated the provisions of Section 12A(a), (b), and (c) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), and (d) and 4(1), (2) (a) and (e) of PFUTP Regulations?    Page 5 of 12  b. If yes, whether the Noticee is liable for penalty under Section 15HA of SEBI Act? c. If yes, what should be the quantum of penalty that should be imposed on the Noticee? 9. Before moving forward further, the relevant extracts of the provision of law, allegedly violated by the Noticee, are mentioned as under-  SEBI Act Prohibition of manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and substantial acquisition of securities or control. 12A. No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) use or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; (b) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange; (c) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder; PFUTP Regulations 3.

Whether the Noticee, by his trades, has resulted in false and misleading appearance of trading as well as contributed to the price in the scrip of RGL (during patch 2) and, therefore, has violated the provisions of Section 12A(a),    Page 7 of 12  (b), and (c) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3(a), (b), (c), and (d) and 4(1), (2) (a) and (e) of PFUTP Regulations?  10.

As brought out in the above table, it is observed that 16 Group Entities contributed Rs.74.85 to net LTP and Rs.116 of positive LTP (i.e. 38.56% of the total market positive LTP) in 1420 trades for 11,83,458 shares. Further analysis of these 1420 trades revealed that in 379 trades for 2,24,612 shares, the counterparties were Group Entities. I note that trading among Group Entities have contributed Rs. 23.35 to positive LTP which is 7.77% of total market LTP.

It is observed that the above mentioned Group entities (16 buyers and 8 sellers) contributed Rs. 23.35 (7.77%) of market positive LTP and thereby contributed to price rise in the scrip during the IP. Therefore, it is alleged that the intragroup trading amongst the Group entities resulted in false and    Page 11 of 12  misleading appearance of trading in the scrip as well as contributed to price rise in the scrip during Patch 2. 18. Therefore, it is alleged that the intragroup trading in patch 2, by the Group Entities, including the Noticee, was with a manipulative intent to increase the share price of RGL. Thus, the Noticee was alleged to have violated sections 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act read with regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a) & (e) of PFUTP Regulations. 19.

It is noted from the records that the present adjudication proceedings were approved on September 01, 2017 and the AO was appointed on September 04, 2017, pursuant to which it was contemplated by SEBI to issue settlement notices to various entities in the matter.

Money Maker operates its advisory activities/business by providing investment advice through products/ services. Some of these products/ services sold by Money Maker are Intraday Cash, Jobbers Cash, Galaxy Cash Services, Intraday Future, MMR Future Express, HNI Options, etc.  7.3. The following observations are made regarding the suitability of investment advice given to clients:  A. Multiple subscriptions of derivative products/ services sold to clients with no experience of such financial products:   7.4. It is observed that Money Maker has sold multiple subscriptions of financial products to clients who have indicated in their RPQ that they have no experience of trading in such financial products. For e.g., client, Mr. Munavath Ravinder, as per his RPQ, has responded that his experience in Commodity market/Derivatives (futures/options/currency) market trading is \\\\\\\\u2018Nil\\\\\\\\u2019. However, it can be seen from the table below that immediately after being on-boarded as a client of the IA, he has been sold products/ services belonging to the derivatives/ commodities category:  Table 1 Sr. No. Date of RPQ/ invoice Product/ Service sold No. of subscriptions 1 Risk profiling was communicated to client on March 27, 2018 2 April 10, 2018 Cash Bluechip@Qly 1 3 April 10, 2018 Revival Future @monthly 1__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Money Maker Research Pvt.

It is not a fair dealing on part of the IA to introduce the clients, immediately after on boarding of the client, to products/ services belonging to the derivatives category.  7.5.

IA Regulations: As per Regulation 17(a), an IA has to ensure that investment advice is appropriate to risk profile of the client. Further, as per Regulation 17(d)(iii), the IA should have a reasonable basis to believe that the client has the necessary experience and knowledge to understand the risks involved in the transactions. As per Regulation 17(e), an IA has to ensure that a recommendation given to client is consistent with client\\\\\\\\u2019s experience, knowledge, investment objective and risk appetite. From the above, it is, prima facie, found that clients, who do not have any experience of dealing in derivative products/ services, have been, immediately after being on-boarded, sold multiple subscriptions of different derivative products/ services by Money Maker. Therefore, Money Maker has not acted with due skill, care, diligence, honesty and in the best interest of its clients while selling products/ services to its clients. In view of the same, Money Maker has, prima facie, (a) failed to provide investment advice as per the risk suitability of clients in accordance with Regulation 17 of the IA Regulations; (b) failed in its responsibility to act in fiduciary capacity to its client which is entrusted upon it under Regulation 15(1) of IA regulation; and (c) failed to abide by Clauses 1, 2 and 8 of the Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Money Maker has, prima facie, violated the provision of__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Money Maker Research Pvt. Ltd.      Page 10 of 37 Clauses 1, 2 and 8 of the Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations, Regulation 15(1) and Regulation 17 of IA Regulations.  B. Advisory Services sold prior to communication of Risk Profiling:  7.7. As per Regulation 17 of the IA Regulations, an IA has to ensure that all investments on which investment advice is provided, is appropriate to the risk profile of the client. Further, Regulation 16(e) requires that the IA has to communicate the risk profile to the client after the risk assessment is done so as to enable the client to verify whether his risk category has been correctly arrived at or not.   7.8. It was observed in the following instances that Money Maker was taking payment from the client for products/ services before the risk profile was communicated to the client: Table 3 Sr. No. Client Name Date when RPQ sent to client Date of collection of fee Amount collected Start of service 1 Mr. Vinod Singh Negi July 04, 2019, on 17:01 PM (KYC was digitally signed by Money Maker on July 04, 2019, at 19:36 PM) July 04, 2019, at 13:46 PM Rs. 11,800/- for \\\\\\\\u2018Intraday Cash\\\\\\\\u2019 service July 05, 2019 2 Mr. Umesh Kumar Pandey October 27, 2018 October 25, 2018 Rs.1,55,000/-for \\\\\\\\u2018Optional Positional @ yearly\\\\\\\\u2019 service October 26, 2018 3 Mr. Bhupen Suresh Vagal July 11, 2018 July 05, 2018 Rs. 5,900/- for \\\\\\\\u2018Intraday cash@ monthly\\\\\\\\u2019 service July 06, 2018 4 Mr. Supriyo Nandiy June 19, 2018 June 16, 2018 Rs. 3,540/- for \\\\\\\\u2018Intraday Cash@monthly\\\\\\\\u2019 service June 18, 2018 June 18, 2018 Rs. 12,980/- for \\\\\\\\u2018Intraday Cash June 19, 2018__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Money Maker Research Pvt.

It is observed from the above table that Money Maker sold its advisory products/ services and collected fees from the clients even before it has communicated the risk profile to the client i.e., the client has not had an opportunity to verify whether his/ her risk category has been correctly arrived at. Thus, it is, prima facie, observed that the product/ service had already been sold by the IA and advisory fees had been collected from the client even before communication of the risk profiling to the client. It has been done, prima facie, by Money Maker to earn advisory fees/ profits by selling products/ services without having any understanding of the requirements of the clients.  7.10. Therefore, from the above it is, prima facie, found that the products/ services sold by Money Maker to its clients\\\\\\\\u2019 could be completely inappropriate to the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 need, as the risk profiling has not been communicated to the client before selling the product/ service. Thereby, the IA has not acted with due skill, care, diligence, honesty and in the best interest of its clients while providing investment advice appropriate to the clients\\\\\\\\u2019 risk profile and had also failed to seek information from its clients about their financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives before selling them a package.  7.11. IA Regulations: As per Regulation 17(a), an IA has to ensure that investment advice is appropriate to risk profile of the client. From the above, it is, prima facie, found that Money Maker has not acted with due skill, care, diligence, honesty and in the best interest of its clients while selling services for its clients. In view of the same, Money Maker has, prima facie, (a) failed to provide the investment advice as per the risk profile of clients in accordance with Regulation__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Money Maker Research Pvt. Ltd.      Page 12 of 37 17 of the IA Regulations; (b) failed in its responsibility to act in fiduciary capacity to its client which is entrusted upon it under Regulation 15(1) of IA regulation; and (c) failed to abide by Clauses 1, 2, 4 and 8 of the Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Money Maker has, prima facie, violated the provision of Clauses 1, 2, 4 and 8 of the Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations, Regulation 15(1) and Regulation 17 of IA Regulations.  C. High-risk product/ service sold to client with Moderate/ Low risk appetite:  7.12. Client-Bhupen Suresh Wagal: As per the risk profile communicated vide email dated July 11, 2018, client\\\\\\\\u2019s risk category is \\\\\\\\u201cModerate\\\\\\\\u201d. However, the product/ service \\\\\\\\u201cHNI Option@monthly\\\\\\\\u201d has been sold to client on July 27, 2018, for Rs. 23,600/- and again on August 22, 2018, for Rs. 11,092/- As per the submissions of Money Maker, the product/ service \\\\\\\\u201cHNI Option@monthly\\\\\\\\u201d is a high-risk category product/ service. As per Regulation 17 of the IA Regulation, \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Adviser shall ensure that all investments on which investment advice is provided is appropriate to the risk profile of the client\\\\\\\\u201d, i.e., the IA cannot sell high risk products/ services to clients having moderate risk appetite.  7.13. IA Regulations: From the above, it is, prima facie, found that Money Maker has sold a product/ service, which is suitable for a client having a High Risk appetite, to a client having Moderate Risk appetite and hence, has not acted with due skill, care, diligence, honesty and in the best interest of its clients while selling products/ services to its clients. In view of the same, Money Maker has, prima facie, (a) failed to provide the investment advice as per the risk profile of clients in accordance with Regulation 17 of the IA Regulations; (b) failed in its responsibility to act in fiduciary capacity to its client, which is entrusted upon it under Regulation 15(1) of IA regulation; and (c) failed to abide by Clauses 1, 2 and 8 of the Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Money Maker has, prima facie, violated the provision of__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Money Maker Research Pvt. Ltd.      Page 13 of 37 Clauses 1, 2 and 8 of the Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations, Regulation 15(1) and Regulation 17 of IA Regulations.  8. Unreasonable / Unfair Fees Charged from Clients:  8.1. As per Clause 6 of the Code of Conduct specified in Third Schedule of the IA Regulations, an investment adviser, advising a client may charge fair and reasonable fees, subject to any ceiling as may be specified by the Board, if any. I note that the examination has, prima facie, found the following instances of collection of unreasonable/ unfair fee:   8.1.1. Service fees charged are disproportionate to the annual income/ proposed investment and 8.1.2. Locking the clients by advance fee for sale of products without refund. 8.1.3. Selling clients two products/ services having different names but the same features    A. Service fees charged are disproportionate to the annual income/ proposed investment:   8.2. It was observed for clients mentioned in the table below that Money Maker has charged fees disproportionate to the annual income/ proposed investment of the clients, as disclosed in the respective risk profile forms of the clients.  Table 4 Sl. No Name of client Fees received from client (Rs.) Annual income as per RPQ (Rs.) Proposed investment by client as per RPQ (Rs.) 1 Mr. Aman Mittal 1,73,312/- 3-5 lakhs < 1 lakh 2 Ms. Shamal Kadam 2,94,001/- < 3 lakhs < 1 lakh 3 Mr. Vijay Soman 19,47,203/- 3-5 lakhs < 1 lakh__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Money Maker Research Pvt. Ltd.      Page 14 of 37 Sl. No Name of client Fees received from client (Rs.) Annual income as per RPQ (Rs.) Proposed investment by client as per RPQ (Rs.) 4 Mr. Mahaveer Prasad Bijarania 4,35,752/- 5-10 lakhs < 1 lakh 5 Mr. Rakesh Kumar B 5,90,002/- 3-5 lakhs 1-3 lakh 6 Mr. Munavat Ravinder 2,59,165/- 5-10 lakhs < 1 lakh 7 Mr. Swaminnathan Karthik 79,301/- < 3 lakh < 1 lakh 8 Mr. Suprio Nandy 3,45,426/- - < 1 lakh   8.3. Thus, from the above table, it is, prima facie, observed that Money Maker has charged fees which are disproportionate either to the annual income or to the proposed investment of the client or to both. In other words, the fees charged by Money Maker are not reasonable.  8.4. In order to determine the \\\\\\\\u201creasonableness\\\\\\\\u201d of the fee charged by an IA, I note that while no fixed standard can be devised to term whether the conduct of charging fee answers the test of reasonableness, it cannot also be stated that the reasonableness of the fee charged cannot be judged at all. The IA Regulations provide for the principle based determination of fee by an IA indicating that such fees have to be fair and reasonable and the same can be tested as a violation of the Code of Conduct. What is reasonable in a particular circumstance may be the outcome of several competing factors which are relevant for such determination. While determining the reasonableness of the fee, the same has to be seen from the perspective of various factors such as proportionality. It is noted that Money Maker has not been fair in its dealing with the clients as outlined above. I, prima facie, find that in view of the fee being disproportionate to the annual income and/ or proposed investment of client, the fees are liable to qualify as being \\\\\\\\u201cunreasonable\\\\\\\\u201d.  B. Locking in clients by collecting advance service fee:__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Money Maker Research Pvt. Ltd.      Page 15 of 37 8.5. It is observed that Money Maker sells a second subscription, in some cases, multiple subscriptions, of the same advisory product/ service to the same client even before the existing subscription of the same product/ service has ended or has even started. It means that two/ multiple subscriptions of the same product/ service are sold with different service periods and fee has been collected for the subsequent subscription(s) while the first subscription is either active or has not even started. Therefore, if the client is dissatisfied/ doesn\\\\\\\\u2019t want to continue with the IA after the first subscription has ended, he cannot do so as he has already paid for the subsequent subscriptions of the same product/ service in advance. An illustrative instance of the client Mr. Aman Mittal is explained below:  Table 5 Sr. No. Date of invoice Product/ Service Period of product/ service Amount (Rs.) 1 August 09, 2018 Option call & Put@monthly August 13-27, 2018 4425/- 2 August 17, 2018 Option call & Put@monthly August 28 to September 5, 2018 2360/- 3 August 25, 2018 Option call & Put@monthly September 6 -14, 2018 2065/- 4 September 05, 2018 Option call & Put@monthly  October 9-November 13, 2018 10030/- 5 September 07, 2018 Option call & Put@qly  December 20, 2018 to May 20, 2019 34810/-  8.6. From the above table, it is observed that the fees for first subscription to the product/ service \\\\\\\\u201cOption call & Put@monthly\\\\\\\\u201d was received on August 09, 2018, with the service to start from August 13 and to end on August 27. While this first subscription is active, the client has been sold two more subscriptions of the same product/ service. Similarly, just before the September 06-14, 2018, subscription for the product/ service \\\\\\\\u201cOption call & Put@monthly\\\\\\\\u201d is about to start, another subscription of the same product/ service is sold. This in effect forces the clients to continue with the services of the IA without any opportunity to sever their ties in case of dis-satisfaction with the first subscription as the__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Money Maker Research Pvt. Ltd.      Page 16 of 37 payment for the subsequent subscriptions have already been paid in advance and there is a \\\\\\\\u2018No Refund\\\\\\\\u2019 policy followed by the IA.   8.7. The inspection has brought to light similar such instances, which are mentioned in the table below:                                               Table 6 Client Name Date of inv", "Date": "2021-01-22", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Interim Order in respect of Money Maker Research Private Limited and its Directors", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jan-2021/interim-order-in-respect-of-money-maker-research-private-limited-and-its-directors_48873.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 59024, "unique_record_id": "82f11ec415SEBI20210122", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6680e52b7858910306471bcc", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 04:54:29", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Fraud - Other", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "There are no financial penalties mentioned in the article.", "gpt_audience": "1.

Noticee has also availed of inspection of relied upon documents. In view of above, I note that principle of natural justice has been complied with and I proceed to decide the matter on merits as per the available record. Page 15 of 27  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS  21. I have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticee, its reply and the documents / material available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are : (a) Whether the Noticee has violated regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(a) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003?  (b) Does the violation, if any, attract monetary penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992?  (c) If so, what would be the quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee after taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992?   22. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003 as below:  PFUTP Regulations, 2003 3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities  No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or proposed to be listed in a recognized stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under; (c) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under. Page 16 of 27   4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities. (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following, namely:\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market;  23. I note that the allegation against the Noticee is that, while dealing in the stock option contracts at BSE during the IP, the Noticee had executed reversal trades which were allegedly non-genuine trades and the same have resulted in the generation of artificial volume in stock option contracts at BSE. Reversal trades are considered to be those trades in which an entity reverses its buy or sell positions in a contract with subsequent sell or buy positions with the same counterparty during the same day. The said reversal trades are alleged to be non-genuine trades as they are not executed in normal course of trading, lack basic trading rationale, lead to false or misleading appearance of trading in terms of generation of artificial volumes, and hence are deceptive & manipulative.   24. Noticee has interalia submitted that entire material gathered with regard to the investigation was not provided to it. I note in this regard that all material relied upon in the issuance of SCN in the matter had been provided to the Noticee, and that Noticee duly carried out inspection of the relied upon documents.   25. I note from the trade log of the Noticee that it had traded in 148 unique contracts in the stock options segment of BSE during the IP. It is observed that the Noticee had executed 363 non-genuine trades in 148 contracts. I further note that the above mentioned trades of the Noticee had resulted in the creation of artificial volume of a total of 1,47,74,570 units in the said 148 Page 17 of 27  contracts and the said trades have also resulted in a close out difference of approximately Rs. 4,67,54,966 against the Noticee. Summary of non-genuine trades of Noticee is as follows:   S. No. Contract Name Avg. Buy Rate (Rs.) Total Buy Volume (No. of units) Avg. Sell Rate Total Sell Volume (No. of units) % of Non Genuine trades of Noticee in the contract to Noticee's Total trades in the Contract % of Non Genuine trades of Noticee in the contract to ", "Date": "2021-01-21", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Adjudication Order in respect of Sanjivani Multivit Herbal Products Ltd in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options on BSE [SAT Appeal No.:516/2022 & Misc.

The Competent Authority has, vide order dated July 1, 2020, appointed the undersigned as the Adjudicating Officer (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cAO\\\\\\\\u201d) under section 15I(1) read with section 19 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 and Rule 3 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cAdjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u201d) to enquire into and adjudge under Rule 4 of the Adjudication Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 3 of 33  Rules and to impose penalty, if the alleged non-compliance is established, under section 15D(a) of the SEBI Act, 1992.

The complainants have enclosed copies of certificates wherein it is shown that the customer is promised a higher amount on maturity under a buy back agreement (repurchase of plot). 4. During the examination of the scheme of the Noticee No. 1 for \"purchase and development of agricultural land under 'Cash Down Payment Plan (CDPP)/ Installment Payment Plan(IPP)\" it was prima facie observed that:  a) As per the Memorandum of Association, one of the main objects of the Company is \\\\\\\\u201cTo carry on the business of real estate and properties including purchase of real estate and development of land/premises/building/housing, creation of plots\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d b) The following facts are noted from the Balance Sheet of the Noticee No.1 for the FY 2010-11:  i.

Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 5 of 33  c) From the Copy of the \\\\\\\\u2018Application Form\\\\\\\\u2019 and \\\\\\\\u2018Agreement\\\\\\\\u2019, following aspects were noted: i. Applications were invited for purchase of plot and its development under the Cash down payment plan or Instalment Payment Plan.  ii. Following clauses were noted in the \\\\\\\\u201cApplication Form\\\\\\\\u201d,  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Payment according to the payment plan(s) has to be made by cheque/demand draft/money order/banker\\\\\\\\u2019s cheque/cash, separately for each application.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 The Company reserves the right to, prospectively, discontinue, change, amend or modify any of the rules/regulations and plans and introduce new plans at any time at its sole discretion with or without any notice.  iii. The investors were required to make payment as per the payment schedule opted after executing the Agreement with the Noticee No.1 and the said agreement was considered as a confirmation from the customers for booking and development of plot to be purchased by the Noticee No.1 . Following are the clauses noted in the \\\\\\\\u201cAgreement\\\\\\\\u201d:  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 AND Whereas the Company organizes the sale of undeveloped agricultural land of different sizes, to prospective buyers and Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 6 of 33  undertakes, at option of the Customer, the development of the same.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 AND Whereas the Company has made arrangements for purchasing/procuring the land with clear and marketable title and with possession, which forms a part of the various plans launched by the Company.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 AND Whereas the Company, by means of an Application, which is the basis of this Agreement and which contains the salient terms and condition of the various Plan, has/have expressed his/her/their desire of buying the said agricultural land and also opted to have the same developed by the Company.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 AND Whereas the Company has agreed to arrange for the sale of the PLOT in favour of the Customer and to develop the same at its expense, by undertaking various development activities, in which the Company possesses the requisite expertise and skill.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 AND Whereas the Plan shall mean cash down payment plan (CDPP), and instalment payment plan (IPP).  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 SALE OF PLOTS  The land shall be allotted in name of Customer, in case of Cash Down Payment Plan after completion of nine months from the date Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 7 of 33  of agreement and in Instalment Payment Plans after having receipt of 50% of the Consideration amount of the plot and development charges within the period of 270 days.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 DEVELOPMENT OF LAND  The Customer has exercised the option to get the Plot developed by the Company and this Agreement shall be construed as a confirmation thereof.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 SALE OF PRODUCE  Unless specifically otherwise directed by the Customer, the Company shall be responsible for arranging the sale of the produce, if any, out of the plot, on behalf of the Customer. For the purposes of arranging the sale of the produce, as aforesaid, the Company shall have the sole discretion to decide as to whether the produce shall be sold in the wholesale market and/or in the semi-wholesale market, and/or to one or more marketing Company, or may decide to sell it to any other market which the Company may consider appropriate for the sale of a particular grade of the produce.   \\\\\\\\uf0b7 SALE PRICE  The task of sale of the produce, undertaken by the Company, shall be subject to the condition that depending upon the grade of the Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 8 of 33  produce harvested from the plot, market conditions and other relevant factors, the Company may decide to sell the produce at such price which it may deem fit and reasonable in the circumstances prevailing at that point of time. It shall be the endeavour of the Company to sell the product at the best prevailing prices and terms. The Customer shall accept the net sale proceeds, so obtained by the Company from the sale of the said produce, as final and no dispute shall be raised in respect of the same.  iv. Upon execution of the Agreement, it appeared that the investors were issued a receipt which entitled the customer/holder for certain square yards of plot after a certain period or the customer/holder was entitled to a higher amount at the end of the period. Following were noted in a receipt enclosed with a complaint received by SEBI.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Received with thanks from \\\\\\\\u2026. a sum of rupees 10,00,000 under company\\\\\\\\u2019s for 2 years on the terms and conditions printed overleaf.

Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 9 of 33  ii. It was stated that the sale deed in respect of the said allotment shall be executed shortly. It indicates that the sale deed has not been executed yet. It is noted that these applications were submitted to the Company during 2008 and 2009, and the Agreement is dated in 2011.  e) As noted from the preceding paragraphs, the Noticee No.1 invited customers/investors to apply for \\\\\\\\u2018purchase and development of agricultural land under Cash Down Payment Plan/ Installment Payment Plan\\\\\\\\u2019. The investors had to apply with application monies in cash/ cheque/ demand draft/ money order. The Noticee No.1 reserved the right to discontinue, change, amend or modify the plan and introduce new plans at any time at its sole discretion. The investors have to execute an agreement on the basis of the application at the time of making payment of application money. The agreement stated that the consideration paid by the customer was towards purchase and development of the plot by the Noticee No.1 . Upon execution of the agreement, a receipt was issued to the investor wherein buy back option at a pre specified price was mentioned.  f) It was observed from the application form that customers were given the option to get the plot developed, whereas, the agreement states that the customer has exercised the option to get the plot developed by the Noticee No.1 and that the agreement shall be construed as confirmation. The overall security of the plot Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 10 of 33  shall, however, be the responsibility of the Noticee No.1 till the expiry of the development period of the Plan opted by the customer. The Noticee No.1 undertook to irrigate it, plant saplings, crops, trees and use fertilizers, pesticides on the crops and plants. The Noticee No.1 also undertakes to arrange for the sale of produce from such land on behalf of the customer. It also decided where to sell the produce (in whole sale market or in semi- wholesale market), the price at which the same is to be sold depending upon the grade of the produce and thereafter give the net sale proceeds to the customer. The customer has no role to play and merely accept the sale proceeds and raise no dispute in this regard.  5. The features of the schemes offered by the Noticee No.1 as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, prima facie showed that the activity of fund mobilization by the Noticee No.1 under its \\\\\\\\u2018scheme(s)/plan(s)\\\\\\\\u2019 with a resultant promise of returns, fell within the ambit of 'collective investment scheme' as defined under Section 11AA of the SEBI Act.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY OF THE NOTICEES AND HEARING 6. There being a prima facie case that the Noticee No.1 was engaged in the mobilization of funds from public under its schemes \\\\\\\\u2018purchase and development of agricultural land under Cash Down Payment Plan/ Installment Payment Plan\\\\\\\\u2019, which was in the nature of a \\\\\\\\u2018collective investment scheme\\\\\\\\u2019, a notice to show cause (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued with respect to the Noticees on November 12, 2020, inter alia Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 11 of 33  containing the allegations as have been stated above. It is alleged therein that the Noticees were in non-compliance of Regulation 3 of the CIS Regulations read with section 12(1B) of the SEBI Act, 1992, while running a CIS without obtaining registration from SEBI. The alleged contravention makes the Noticees liable for monetary penalty under Section 15D(a) of the SEBI Act, 1992. In the said SCN the Noticees No. 2-5 were prima facie held to be the directors of the Noticee No.1 at the time when the aforesaid alleged violation of mobilization of funds under an unregistered CIS was undertaken and therefore liable for the actions of the Noticee No.1, which is a juristic entity.  7. The Noticees filed a common reply dated December 18, 2020, to the SCN. The submissions made vide the said reply are summarized as follows:  a. The company is in the business of sale and purchase of real estate and properties and also in development of the lands in accordance with its main object as enshrined in the object clause of its Memorandum of Association. (paragraph no. 2)  b. At paragraph no 3, while describing the contents of the \\\\\\\\u201cregistration letter\\\\\\\\u201d, nowhere do the Noticees say that it specifies the exact plot of land that is to be allotted to a customer. Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 12 of 33  c. At paragraph no. 10 of the said reply, it has been stated that the scheme indicates \\\\\\\\u201cexpected\\\\\\\\u201d increased value of land, it nowhere promises such return. It is only indicative of the expected appreciation in the value of the land without any obligation on the part of the company to pay such amount. The contribution or payment by every customer is made mainly for the purchase of land and for its development. The customer may be paid such appreciated value of land if he/ she exercises such option and the company agrees to the same.[ emphasis supplied]  d. At paragraph no. 9 of the said reply, it has been stated that the company enters into an agreement with each customer for selling specified piece of land and subsequently the said piece of land is transferred in the name of the customer by way of a registered sale deed. The piece of land for sale is fully identified and the customer becomes an absolute owner of the said piece of land on registration of the sale deed in his favour. The customer has no right on the other assets of the company. Payment by the customer is also not made to run the business of the company, nor there is any profit sharing scheme with the customers. As such it cannot be said that the amount paid by the customers is pooled for the purpose of any scheme of the company, as observed in the SCN. In this regard, it is noted that this submission directly contradicts the highlighted submissions at sub paragraph (c) above. Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 13 of 33  e. At paragraph no. 11 of the said reply, it has been stated that there is hardly any question of management of the customer\\\\\\\\u2019s piece of land. It is rather a case of development of the land which has been purchased by the customer from the company and the company is expected to develop it and handover to the customer. The company only exercises certain developmental rights over such pieces of land as per the agreement.   f. Noticee No. 4 is the wife of the Noticee No. 2 and was not actively involved in the day to day affairs of the company. She had resigned from the directorship on November 30, 2010 and she may be dropped from the proceedings.   g. The order of SEBI against NGHI Developers India Limited passed by SEBI was challenged before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT where the said order was upheld. The order of SAT has been challenged before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, which has admitted the appeal and the same is pending as on date. h. The jurisdiction of SEBI is restricted to the Collective Investment Schemes which are operating in the securities market. Further the intention of law was to regulate CIS which were/ would be operating in the securities market by issuing securities in the form of unit certificate and the Company has not been issuing any unit certificate or plantation/ agro bond which can be treated as \\\\\\\\u2018securities\\\\\\\\u2019 within the meaning of Section 2(h)(ib) of the Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act, 1956 Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 14 of 33  8. Thereafter, during the hearing held on December 22, 2020, the authorized representative of the Noticees while reiterating the submissions already made vide the reply dated December 18, 2020, additionally submitted that since the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court is seized of the appeal with respect an analogous dispute (whether the schemes floated are CIS under section 11AA(2) of the SEBI Act) pertaining to a group company (NGHI Developers India Limited) of the Noticee No. 1 (under same management as the Noticee No.1), the present proceedings may be kept in abeyance till the said appeal is disposed. He further submitted that out of the total dues payable to the customers/ subscribers to the scheme of the Noticee No.1, only Rs. 2.5 Crores is left to be rapid. Balance sheets of the Noticee No. 1 were provided in support of this submission. Further, copies of several judgments of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT and the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court passed in the matter of the schemes/ business run by the Noticee No. 1 and its group company referred above, were submitted. CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 9. The following issues arise for consideration in the present case:  a. Whether the Noticees were operating a CIS without obtaining registration from SEBI?  b. If the answer to the question above is in the affirmative, does that violate Section 12(1B) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 3 of the CIS Regulations? Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 15 of 33  c. If the answers to the questions raised above are in the affirmative, what should be the quantum of penalty that can be imposed on the Noticees under Section 15D(a) of SEBI Act, 1992? 10. Before proceeding further in the case, the contents of the aforementioned provisions of law is reproduced herein below: SEBI Act 1992 12 (1B) No person shall sponsor or cause to be sponsored or carry on or caused to be carried on any venture capital funds or collective investment schemes including mutual funds, unless he obtains a certificate of registration from the Board in accordance with the regulations: SEBI (CIS) Regulations, 1999 No Person Other than Collective Investment Management Company to Launch[collective investment scheme]  3. No person other than a Collective Investment Management Company which has obtained a certificate under these regulations shall carry on or sponsor or launch a collective investment scheme. Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 16 of 33  11. From the features of the plan/schemes operated by the Noticees as discussed above, it is observed that the Noticees were running a scheme/ plan containing the following features:  i. As per the \\\\\\\\u2018agreement\\\\\\\\u2019, the Noticee No. 1 had made arrangements for purchasing/ procuring the land. This suggests that the Noticee No. 1 did not have the land/plots under its ownership on the date of application/ agreement.  ii. The Noticee No. 1 had two plans i.e. cash down payment plan and installment payment plan. As per the agreement, the customer has an option to choose from the aforesaid two plans.   iii. Under the cash down payment plan, the land had to be allotted to the customers after completion of nine months from the date of the agreement. Under the installment payment plan, the land had to be allotted within a period of 540 days after the receipt of 50% of the cost of the plot.   iv. The Noticee No. 1, as per the agreement, had extended the facility of 'opting out' only to the customers who had made the investment under the cash down payment plan. Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 17 of 33  v. The Noticee No. 1 reserved its right to discontinue/ change/ modify the rules and plans.   vi. The land is owned and possessed by the Noticee No.1 till the expiry of the scheme.   vii. The application form speaks of agreement of deposit between the customer and the Noticee No.1.   viii. Though the application form gives an option for development and choice of State, however, the development is integral in the agreement and the land allotment is at the choice of the Noticee No.1.   ix. The customer is said to be the owner of plot after execution of the sale deed, however, no sale deed has been placed on record to show that the Company had executed sale deeds.   x. The security of the plot is retained by the Company. The sale of produce along with wastage is retained by the Noticee No.1. Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 18 of 33   xi. The primary initial document i.e. the application form and the agreement contains the clauses that the customer is applying for the \\\\\\\\u2018farm land plot\\\\\\\\u2019 and for development of the same by the Noticee No. 1. It is noted that the customer cannot enter into an agreement unless he/ she gives the development rights to the Noticee No.1.  xii. Customer does not get any claim over the common facilities provided by the Company.   xiii. The Company provides the accidental insurance cover to its customers/ investors.   12. Having considered the above, now I proceed to deal with the charges levelled against the Noticee No. 1. The main allegation levelled against the Noticee No.1 is that it is operating CIS without obtaining registration from SEBI. CIS means any scheme or arrangement which satisfies the conditions specified in Section 11 AA of the SEBI Act, which provides as under:   \"(1) Any scheme or arrangement which satisfies the conditions referred to in subsection (2) or sub-section (2A) shall be a collective investment scheme: Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 19 of 33  Provided that any pooling of funds under any scheme or arrangement, which is not registered with the Board or is not covered under sub-section (3), involving a corpus amount of one hundred crore rupees or more shall be deemed to be a collective investment scheme.   (2) Any scheme or arrangement made or offered by any person under which,   (i) the contributions, or payments made by the investors, by whatever name called, are pooled and utilized solely for the purposes of the scheme or arrangement;   (ii) the contributions or payments are made to such scheme or arrangement by the investors with a view to receive profits, income, produce or property, whether movable or immovable from such scheme or arrangement;   (iii) the property, contribution or investment forming part of scheme or arrangement, whether identifiable or not, is managed on behalf of the investors;   (iv) the investors do not have day to day control over the management and operation of the scheme or arrangement. Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 20 of 33  (2A) Any scheme or arrangement made or offered by any person satisfying the conditions as may be specified in accordance with the regulations made under this Act.   (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2) [or sub-section (2A)], any scheme or Arrangement:  i. made or offered by a co-operative society  ii. under which deposits are accepted by non-banking financial companies  iii. being a contract of insurance  iv. providing for any scheme, Pension Scheme or the Insurance Scheme framed under the Employees Provident Fund  v. under which deposits are accepted under section 58A of the Companies Act, 1956  vi. under which deposits are accepted by a company declared as a Nidhi or a mutual benefit society  vii. falling within the meaning of Chit business as defined in clause (d) of section 2 of the Chit Fund Act, 1982(40 of 1982);  viii. under which contributions made are in the nature of subscription to a mutual fund;  ix. such other scheme or arrangement which the Central Government may, in consultation with the Board, notify,  shall not be a collective investment scheme.\" Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 21 of 33   The term \\\\\\\\u2018securities\\\\\\\\u2019 in section 2(h) of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 was amended vide the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 1999, with effect from February 22, 2000, to include units or any other instrument issued by any collective investment scheme to the investors in such schemes.   13. I now, proceed to test the characteristics of the impugned schemes/ plans floated and carried on by the / against the four conditions under Section 11AA(2) of the SEBI Act.   i. The first condition is that the contributions, or payments made by the investors, by whatever name called, are pooled and utilized for the purposes of the scheme or arrangement. The Notiee No. 1 took the contribution/ investments of the customers in accordance with its plans for the purchase of \\\\\\\\u2018farm land plot\\\\\\\\u2019. The amount paid by the investors remains with the Company till the end of the term. It is noted that at the stage of application form and agreement, the Noticee No. 1 do not identify the land to be sold to the customer. The 'agreement' only states that the Noticee No. 1 has \\\\\\\\u2018made arrangements for purchasing/ procuring the land', the same suggests that the Company on the date of agreement only made arrangements for procuring the land.   The registration letter also does not identify the land and only provides for the size of the plot and the 'expected value' of the land which had to be allotted. By Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 22 of 33  its own admission, the Noticee No. 1 alloted the land under the \\\\\\\\u2018cash down payment plan\\\\\\\\u2019 after completion of nine months from the date of the agreement, while under the \\\\\\\\u2018installment payment plan\\\\\\\\u2019, the land was to be allotted within a period of 540 days after the receipt of 50% of the cost of the plot and development charges. Further, while allotting the land vide the allotment letter, the Noticee No. 1 reserves its right to change the location of the allotment of land. Also, at paragraph no. 10 of the reply dated December 18, 2020, the Noticee No. 1 admits that \\\\\\\\u201cThe contribution or payment by every customer is made mainly for the purchase of land and for its development\\\\\\\\u201d. These facts suggest that the Noticee No. 1 pools the investment made by the customers, with an aim/ object of carrying out the overall scheme/ plan.   Further, from the \\\\\\\\u2018notes on accounts\\\\\\\\u2019 of the Statutory Auditor of the Company for the Financial Year ending 2011, it has been noted that the Company had purchased land from the collections made from customers. I consider these events/ information as sufficient to hold that the 'contributions, or payments made by the investors, are pooled and utilised\\\\\\\\u2019 by the Noticee No.1 for the purposes of the \\\\\\\\u2018scheme or arrangement', thus, satisfying the first condition as stipulated in Section 11AA(2)(i) of the SEBI Act.   ii. The second condition is that the contributions or payments are made to such scheme or arrangement by the investors with a view to receive profits, income, Adjudication Order in respect of five entities in the matter of Nicer Green Housing and Infrastructure Developers Limited  Page 23 of 33  produce or property, whether movable or immovable from such scheme or arrangement. In the registration letter, the customer is provided with the \\\\\\\\u2018estimated realizable value\\\\\\\\u2019/ \\\\\\\\u2018expected value\\\\\\\\u2019 on the investment made. The Noticee No.1 in its reply has submitted that \\\\\\\\u2018estimated realizable value\\\\\\\\u2019/ \\\\\\\\u2018expected value\\\\\\\\u2019 is only an expected appreciation in the value of the land without any obligation on the part of the Company to pay such amount. I note that mere promise of \\\\\\\\u2018estimated realizable value\\\\\\\\u2019 higher than the amount invested shows that the investment/ contributions were made with a view of earning profits. Further, the Company also provides for \\\\\\\\u2018personal accidental risk\\\\\\\\u2019 cover as an additional facility to its customers. The same makes it clear that the investors made contribution/ payment with a view to receive the profits/ income/ property/ return on their investments that may accrue to them as applicable, thus attracting the second condition as stipulated in Section 11AA(2)(ii) of the SEBI Act.   iii. The third condition is that the property, contribution or investment forming part of scheme or arrangement, whether identifiable or not, is managed on behalf of the investors. The fourth condition is that the investors do not have day to day control over the management and operation of the scheme or arrangement. In this regard, I note that the Company takes the consent of the customer/ investor for the Company itself to look after the day to day maintenance of the \\\\\\\\u2018farm land plot\\\\\\\\u2019. Thus, it is clear that the land as mentioned in the allotment letter is not managed by the customers at any stage of the plan.

Page 2 of 52 India (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018PFUTP Regulations, 2003\\\\\\\\u2019), by engaging in a fraudulent scheme by creating a sham appearance of receipt of funds through a preferential allotment of non-convertible preference shares, which indirectly, for the most part, was financed by PPTIL itself through round tripping of funds using conduit entities. The SCN also alleges that PPTIL attempted to issue bonus shares by capitalizing the securities premium account, which account itself was created from the funds that were allegedly received from the impugned preferential allotment and thus indirectly financed by PPTIL.   Show Cause Notice, Replies, Inspection of Documents, Personal Hearing and Submissions:  2.

It was observed that Noticee no. 2, who was the promoter of PPTIL was also the co-promoter of Noticee no. 7.  b. Funds amounting to Rs. 20 crores were transferred by Noticee no. 7 to PPTIL in 27 tranches (amounts ranging from Rs. 28 lakh to Rs. 1.94 crore) during Jun 8, 2012 to Jun 29, 2012.

Explanation was sought from Noticee no. 7 about the reason for the receipt of funds along with supporting evidence. Noticee no. 7 provided the reason as refund of advance payment towards purchase of plot. The details of funds received by Noticee no. 7 from various entities as submitted by Noticee no. 7 and the comments on the same is given below:                 Fund receipts by Noticee no. 7 Funds received by Fidelo from the entities Date on Jun 2012 Entity Amount (Rs.) Reason given by Fidelo Comments 11-14 SMC  8,46,00,000  Advance payment for property  Documentation related to the advance payment was not submitted by Fidelo   7-21 India Finsec 2,52,00,000 Advance payment for property Documentation related to the advance payment was not submitted by Fidelo 15 Radhika Kapur 1,00,00,000 Advance payment for property Documentation related to the advance payment was not submitted by Fidelo 19 Om Parkash Tarsem Chand 1,00,00,000 Advance payment for property Documentation related to the advance payment was not submitted by Fidelo 18 Gagan Arora 1,00,00,000 Advance payment for property Documentation related to advance payment was not submitted by Fidelo. 15 Girish Kapur 1,00,00,000 Advance payment for property Documentation related to the advance payment was not submitted by Fidelo 20 Enn Emm Machines 1,00,00,000 Advance payment for property Documentation related to the advance payment was not submitted by Fidelo 18 Mukesh Steel Traders 1,00,00,000 Advance payment for property Documentation related to the advance payment was not submitted by Fidelo 15 Harvinder SIngh 50,00,000 Advance payment for property Documentation related to the advance payment was not submitted by Fidelo 18 Puja Arora 35,00,000 Advance payment for property Documentation related to the advance payment was not submitted by Fidelo  Total 17,83,00,000    h. On the basis of analysis of the replies of PPTIL and Noticee no. 7, it is revealed that PPTIL had taken a differing stand with respect to the reason for fund transfers during the course of the investigation. For e.g. PPTIL in its earlier communication dated Nov 20, 2012 mentioned that the fund transfers to Noticee no. 11, 12 and 13 was short term loan but in its later communication dated Aug 25, 2014 mentioned that it was advance payment towards purchaseFinal Order in the matter of Pankaj Piyush Trade and Investments Ltd.  Page 8 of 52 of property. Both PPTIL and Noticee no. 7 failed to produce documentary proof to substantiate their claims about the transactions. The funds transferred by Noticee no. 7 to PPTIL were circulated multiple times to create an appearance of receipt of payment, in entirety, towards preferential issue of shares.  i. Noticee no. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, were the directors of PPTIL at the time when PPTIL indulged in the transactions discussed hereinabove. Thus, it is observed that PPTIL along with its directors Noticee no. 2 to 6, and entities namely Noticee no. 7 to 17 engaged in a fraudulent scheme of issuing non-convertible preference shares without receipt of actual consideration from the allotees. The appearance of the payment of funds was created through circular rotation of funds among themselves.   j. The detailed analysis of fund transfers made by Noticee no. 7 to PPTIL towards the preferential allotment is given as below:  Analysis of fund transfers made by Noticee no. 7 to PPTIL towards preferential allotment S.No. Date of fund transfer by Noticee no. 7 to PPTIL Amount Paid (in Rs.

The investigation further revealed that the Board of Directors of PPTIL at its meeting held on July 18, 2012 recommended the issue of bonus shares in theFinal Order in the matter of Pankaj Piyush Trade and Investments Ltd.  Page 9 of 52 ratio of 45:1 through capitalisation of securities premium account. For the issuance of bonus shares at this ratio, a free reserve of Rs. 18 crores would have been required. As per Reg. 94 (1) of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations 2009, \"the bonus issue shall be made out of free reserves built out of the genuine profits or securities premium collected in cash only and reserves created by revaluation of fixed assets shall not be capitalised for the purpose of issuing bonus shares\".  l. As per the balance sheet submitted by PPTIL, the securities premium account of PPTIL during the FY ending Mar 2012 and 2013 are as given below:     Comparison of Reserves and Surplus of PPTIL for F.Y. ending 2012 and 2013 Reserves and Surplus of PPTIL for  FY ending Mar 2013 (in Rs lakhs) FY ending Mar 2012 (in Rs lakhs) Securities Premium Account 1800  - Capital Reserve 2456.69 2456.69 General Reserve 5.6 5.6 Surplus/Deficit in P&L (1859.61) (1862.58) Total 2402.68 599.71  m. From the above table, it is observed that PPTIL did not have enough balance in its securities premium account during the financial year ending 2012.  It was further observed that PPTIL made a preferential allotment to Noticee no. 7 in July 2, 2012 due to which funds amounting to Rs. 20 crore was purportedly received by PPTIL. For the purpose of the preferential allotment, PPTIL funded Noticee no. 7 by round tripping of funds  as shown above. Thereafter, the amount collected (partly in cash and mostly through round tripping of funds) was credited into the share capital account and share premium account of PPTIL. It is also revealed that the amount credited to the share premium account i.e. Rs. 18 crore, ostensibly funded by the preferential allottee was the exact amount proposed to be capitalised for the issue of bonus shares. Therefore, it is concluded that PPTIL made a preferential allotment to Noticee no. 7 for the purpose of crediting its securities premium account which would enable it to execute the bonus issue.  n. In view of the above, it is alleged that the Noticees have violated Section 12A (a), (b), (c) of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulations 3 (b), (c), (d), 4 (1), 4 (2)(a) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003 by engaging in a fraudulent scheme ofFinal Order in the matter of Pankaj Piyush Trade and Investments Ltd.  Page 10 of 52 issuing non-convertible preference shares by creating an appearance of the payment of funds through circular rotation of funds among themselves during June 2012. It is also alleged that PPTIL attempted to issue of bonus shares without collecting the securities premium in cash.  3. The Noticee nos. 1 to 17 were, therefore, called upon to show cause as to why directions under Sections 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992, should not be issued against them for violation of the aforementioned regulations of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. Noticee No.1 is additionally called upon to show cause as to why directions including restraining it from proceeding with the bonus issue of shares as approved by the Board of Directors on July 18, 2012 should not be issued against it.   4. Noticee no. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 vide their reply dated April 18, 2017, Noticee no. 17 vide its reply dated September 1, 2017 and Noticee no. 8 vide its reply dated April 24, 2017, had sought inspection of documents from SEBI. I note that SEBI, vide email dated July 14, 2020, had intimated to the said Noticees that an inspection of documents, can be arranged at any time at SEBI Head Office by intimating the date and time of visit in advance. I note that, pursuant to the communication of the said email, no request for inspection was received from any of the said Noticees. I also note that vide the said email dated July 14, 2020, the said Noticees were also informed that all documents that have been relied upon by the SCN have already been made part of the Annexure to the SCN. The request for inspection of Investigation Report in the matter was not allowed by SEBI for the reason that all the findings that were relevant and relied upon by SEBI while issuing the SCN, have already been reproduced in the SCN along with the relevant Annexures. With regard to the request for cross-examination and/or providing copy of statement recordings done during investigation, SEBI had denied the same, as no statement recordings were relied upon by the SCN. In view of the above, I note that adequate opportunity for inspection of documents had been provided by SEBI, however, the said Noticees failed to avail the same.   5. An opportunity of personal hearing was granted to all the Noticees in the matter on August 13, 2020. On the scheduled date of hearing, Noticee no. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13 and 17, were heard through audio-video web-conference. NoneFinal Order in the matter of Pankaj Piyush Trade and Investments Ltd.  Page 11 of 52 appeared for Noticee no. 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15 and 16, and neither a request for adjournment was received from them. From the record of service of hearing notice for the hearing scheduled on August 13, 2020, it was observed that adequate material was not available to confirm the delivery of hearing notice to Noticee no. 9, 10 and 14, hence, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to Noticee no. 9, 10 and 14 on November 4, 2020. On the scheduled date, none of the said Noticees appeared for the hearing, neither any request for adjournment was received from them. I note that Noticee no. 14, 15 and 16 have neither filed any reply to the SCN, nor availed the opportunity of personal hearing that was granted to them. The matter is being proceeded ex-parte qua Noticee no. 14, 15 and 16.   6. The key contentions raised by Noticee no. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 while adopting Noticee no. 1\\\\\\\\u2019s merit based reply dated August 10, 2020, at the time of personal hearing held on August 13, 2020 and vide Noticee no. 1\\\\\\\\u2019s written submissions dated August 25, 2020, are as follows:  a. Admittedly, the present violations relate to preference issue in June 2012. Admittedly, the SCN was issued in April 2017 i.e. after atleast five years of the impugned transactions. Clearly there has been extraordinary inordinate delay in the issuance of the SCN. The aforesaid inordinate delay has severely prejudiced us and the delay has not been explained by SEBI.   b. We reiterate that the issuance of 20 Lacs 6% non-cumulative redeemable preference shares to Noticee no. 7 was made in the ordinary course of business in consonance with the applicable provisions of law. The context of fund transfer by PPTIL to other entities is set out hereinbelow:  Transfer of amount to Noticee no. 8 (SMC Power Generation) Rs. 846 Lacs were transferred to Noticee no. 8 during June 11 to 14, 2012, as unsecured loan/ advance. We may point out that the said amount was returned by Noticee no. 8 during FY 2013-14 in multiple tranches. Due to passage of time, we are not in a position to trace out the copy of the agreement entered with Noticee no. 8.Final Order in the matter of Pankaj Piyush Trade and Investments Ltd.  Page 12 of 52 Transfer of amount to Noticee no. 9 and 10 (Ms. Radhika Kapur and Mr. Girish Kapur)  Rs. 100 Lacs each were transferred to Noticee no. 9 and 10, as advance towards purchase of property which was owned by them in Panchsheel Park, New Delhi. Since, the deal for purchase of property did not fructify, we had sought the refund of amounts and accordingly, the said amounts of Rs. 2 Crores were returned by them in November/ December 2012.  Transfer of amount to Noticee no. 11 (Mr. Harvinder Singh)  Rs. 50 Lacs was transferred to Noticee no. 11, as advance towards purchase of property which was owned by him in Rohini, New Delhi. Since, the deal for purchase of property did not fructify, we had sought the refund of amounts and accordingly, the said amounts of Rs. 50 lacs were returned by Noticee no. 11 on November 19, 2012. With regards to the alleged discrepancies, with regard to the advance payment for purchase of property, as pointed out by the SCN, we state that the same was an inadvertent error. Transfer of amount to Noticee no. 12 (Ms. Puja Arora). Rs. 35 Lacs  was transferred to Noticee no. 12, as advance towards purchase of property which was owned by her in Rohini, New Delhi. Since, the deal for purchase of property did not fructify, we had sought the refund of amounts and accordingly, the said amounts of Rs. 35 lacs were returned by Noticee no. 12 on November 17, 2012. With regards to the alleged discrepancies, with regard to the advance payment for purchase of property, as pointed out by the SCN, we state that the same was an inadvertent error.  Transfer of amount to Noticee no. 13 (Mr. Gagan Arora) Rs. 100 Lacs was transferred to Noticee no. 13, as advance towards purchase of property which was owned by him in Rohini, New Delhi. Since, the deal for purchase of property did not fructify, we had sought the refund of amounts and accordingly, the said amounts of Rs. 100 lacs were returned by Noticee no. 13 in January to August 2013. With regards to the alleged discrepancies, with regard to the advance payment for purchase of property, as pointed out by the SCN, we state that the same was an inadvertent error. Transfer of amount to Noticee no. 15 (M/s. Mukesh Steel Traders) Rs. 100 Lacs was transferred to Noticee no. 15 as an unsecured loan. The said loan amount was paid by Noticee no. 15,Final Order in the matter of Pankaj Piyush Trade and Investments Ltd.  Page 13 of 52 alongwith interest of Rs. 9,00,250/- in August 2013.  Transfer of amount to Noticee no. 14 (Mr. Om Prakash Tarsem Chand) Rs. 100 Lacs was transferred to Noticee no. 14 as an unsecured loan. The said loan amount was paid by Noticee no. 14, alongwith interest of Rs. 9,00,250/- in August 2013. Transfer of amount to Noticee no. 16 (M/s.Enn Emm Machines) Rs. 212 Lacs was transferred to Noticee no. 16, as advance towards purchase of property in New Delhi. Since, the deal for purchase of property did not fructify, we had sought the refund of amounts and accordingly, the said amounts of Rs. 212 lacs were returned by Noticee no. 16 during May 2013 to March 2014. Due to passage of time, we are not in a position to trace out the copy of the agreement entered with Noticee no. 16.   c. Further, we had received the entire amount towards subscription from Noticee no. 7. The bonafide utilization/ transfer of funds made by us to various entities in particular context in the ordinary course of business has not been appreciated properly and has been viewed suspiciously by connecting the same to issuance of non-cumulative non-convertible preference shares. We reiterate that there is no nexus between the same as insinuated in the SCN.   d. In any event it is submitted that the entire amount which was transferred by us to various person or entities (viz. Noticee no. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16) had come back to the coffers of PPTIL (pursuant to the non-fructification of purchase of property or repayment of loans or advances with interest. The return of amounts transferred has also been corroborated and certified by M/s. V. N. Purohit and Co., Chartered Accountants vide their certificated dated August 1, 2020. It is not the case of SEBI that the amount siphoned off/ round tripped (as alleged) are still at large and have not come back. In fact, much prior to issuance of SCN, the amounts which are alleged to be round tripped / siphoned off had already come back to PPTIL.   e. With regard to Noticee no. 2 being the co-promoter of Noticee no. 7, we would like to state that this is not the fact, as Noticee no. 2 was never associated with Noticee no. 7.Final Order in the matter of Pankaj Piyush Trade and Investments Ltd.  Page 14 of 52  f. The amount of 20 Crores arising from the preference issue, over the years, has been utilized by PPTIL for its business purpose. Same is borne out by the books of the Company. Consequent to the utilization of the said amounts over the years into the business operations of the Company, the Company\\\\\\\\u2019s networth has increased from around Rs. 3 Crores in FY 2012-13 to around Rs. 26 Crores in FY 2019-20.  g. As a consequence of the preference issue, the Company or its shareholders have not been adversely impacted in any manner. It may be appreciated that the said preference issue did not result in any dilution of voting rights of the shareholders or did not confer any voting rights on Noticee no. 7. The Company, over the years, has not even paid any dividend to Noticee no. 7.   h. The bonus issue, which has been adverted in the SCN, though contemplated, was never undertaken by the Company, due to non-grant of permission by SEBI. There have been no investor complaints against the Company.   7. The key contentions raised by Noticee no. 4, 5 and 6 vide their separate merit based reply dated August 11, 2020 and at the time of personal hearing held on August 13, 2020, are as follows:  a. Noticee no. 5 was independent non-executive director of PPTIL from April 12, 2012 to August 12, 2014. Noticee no. 6 was independent non-executive director of PPTIL from April 12, 2012 to May 29, 2017. Noticee no. 4 was non-executive director of PPTIL from March 3, 2011 and thereafter became independent director from July 15, 2012 and continued to be independent director till April 30, 2016.   b. As the independent director, we were not involved in day to day affairs and management of the Company. During our limited tenure as independent directors, we were not involved in any alleged round tripping of funds, which is the allegation in the SCN.Final Order in the matter of Pankaj Piyush Trade and Investments Ltd.  Page 15 of 52 c. We have not attended the board meeting held on June 4, 2012, wherein the issuance of preference shares was approved. In fact, during the FY 2012-13, we had attended very few board meetings owing to our personal difficulties.  d. There is not even a whisper or shred of evidence on record to show that there is any act committed by us (i.e. the alleged round tripping), from which a resonable evidence can be drawn that we could be held liable.   e. Significantly, it may be noted that, there is no allegation that, we have made any profits in any manner by virtue of the alleged activities.   f. We adopt the reply filed by Noticee no. 1 dated August 10, 2020, contesting the allegations levelled in the SCN. The said reply be read as part and parcel of our reply.   g. Even if it is held that PPTIL has violated any of the provisions of SEBI Act, 1992, we cannot be held liable for the same because of the reasons as stated above.   8. I note that Noticee no. 7 has not filed any reply nor has it appeared for personal hearing in the matter. However, I note that M/s. Yamini Investments Company Ltd. (on behalf of Noticee no. 7) vide its merit based reply dated July 20, 2020 and April  22, 2017, has raised the following key contentions to the SCN:  a.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u2018SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019) had conducted an investigation in the matter of Garware Polyester Limited (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018GPL/the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019), a listed company having its shares listed on Bombay Stock Exchange Limited (BSE) and National Stock Exchange India Limited (NSE).

From the above table, it was observed that the promoter-directors made acquisitions of shares of GPL, which warranted disclosures to GPL and Stock Exchanges, since the value of the shares exceeded \\\\\\\\u20b95Lakh. It is noted that the promoter-directors had made disclosures to the Noticee in terms of regulation 13(4) read with 13(5) of the PIT Regulations, however, the Noticee further on receipt of such disclosures from the promoter-directors, had filed the disclosures with the stock exchange with significant delay. In view of the above, it has been alleged that the Noticee has violated the provisions of regulation 13(6) of the PIT Regulations. The relevant provisions of the PIT Regulations are reproduced as under: Disclosure by company to stock exchanges. (6) Every listed company, within two working days of receipt, shall disclose to all stock exchanges on which the company is listed, the information received under sub-regulations (1), (2), (3) and (4) in the respective formats specified in Schedule III.  4. Upon completion of the investigation, SEBI felt satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to inquire and adjudicate upon the alleged violations of the provisions of the PIT Regulations, by the Noticee. By a communication-order dated July 31, 2019, Shri Santosh Shukla was appointed as Adjudicating Officer to inquire into and adjudge under section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act for the alleged violations by the Noticee. Shri Santosh Shukla sought certain clarifications from the_______________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in respect of Garware Polyester Limited  Page 3 of 10 concerned department and in the meantime, pursuant to transfer of Shri Santosh Shukla, vide communication-order dated January 07, 2020, this case was transferred to the undersigned with advise that except for the change of the Adjudicating Officer the other terms and conditions of the original orders \\\\\\\\u2018shall remain unchanged and shall be in full force and effect\\\\\\\\u2019 and that the \\\\\\\\u201cAdjudicating Officer shall proceed in accordance with the terms of reference made in the original orders\\\\\\\\u201d.  5. After the receipt of the records and clarification from the concerned department, the notice to show cause no. EAD-2/SS/VS/11769/1-6/2020 dated July 16, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SCN\\\\\\\\u2019) was issued to the Noticee in terms of rule 4(1) of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018the Adjudication Rules\\\\\\\\u2019) read with section 15I of the SEBI Act. The SCN was sent at the last known address of the Noticee through Speed Post Acknowledgment Due, which was, duly served upon the Noticee. In the said SCN, the Noticee was asked to reply within a period of 14 days. The Noticee vide letters dated July 21, 2020, August 03, 2020 and August 21, 2020 repetitively requested additional time to file reply. Due to ongoing pandemic situation the request of the Noticee was acceded to. However, no reply to the SCN was filed by the Noticee.  6. The Noticee vide email dated August 31, 2020 informed that the Noticee is going to file settlement application. However, no information was provided to the undersigned in this regard. Accordingly, vide letter dated October 07, 2020, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on October 21, 2020. In response to the SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s letter dated October 07, 2020, the Noticee vide letter dated October 08, 2020 submitted that the Noticee had already filed settlement application on October 06, 2020 and provided the copy of the settlement application. Thereafter, concerned department for settlement vide email dated November 05, 2020, informed that the Noticee have withdrawn its application. Accordingly, another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on December 10, 2020, which was communicated to Noticee vide email dated November 06, 2020. Further, due to ongoing pandemic situation the Noticee was also given option to avail the hearing opportunity through video-conferencing on the Webex platform.  7. Thereafter, the Notice vide letter dated November 21, 2020 requested to provide the copies of relevant information, documents and records pertaining to SCN. SEBI vide its email dated December 04, 2020 provided the following details to the Noticee: a) GPL\\\\\\\\u2019s e-mail dated May 10, 2018, regarding the date of receipt of disclosure filed by Promoters / Directors of GPL_______________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in respect of Garware Polyester Limited  Page 4 of 10 b) Disclosures received by BSE under regulation 13(6) of the PIT Regulations from GPL (Information sought in terms of section 15I(2) of the SEBI Act)  8. In response to above email, the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s Authorised Representative (AR) vide letter dated December 07, 2020 requested physical inspection of the above documents. In view of the above, SEBI vide email dated December 08, 2020, informed to Noticee and AR that due to the prevailing situation of COVID-19, in the interest of public health and safety, physical inspection of documents may not be the appropriate. Hence, scanned original relevant relied upon documents were provided to the Noticee by email dated December 04, 2020. Vide email dated December 08, 2020 the Noticee was also advised to file reply to the SCN and also informed to appear for personal hearing on December 17, 2020. However, no reply was received from the Noticee.  9. On schedule date of hearing i.e., December 17, 2020, the ARs of the Noticee namely Mr. Somasekhar Sundaresan, Mr. Abishek Venkataraman, Advocate, Mr. Sanjay Buch, Mr. Abhay Jadeja, Ms. Shruti Katakey and Ms. Yashvi Shah, appeared on behalf of the Noticee and made oral submissions and requested further time to file written submission. The request of the ARs was considered and time to file written submissions by December 30, 2020 was granted. The Noticee vide letter dated December 30, 2020 filed post hearing submissions.  10. I have carefully considered the allegations and charges levelled against the Noticee, the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s representation and materials relied upon by SEBI and proceed to examine the same in succeeding paras.  11. The Noticee has contended that the instant proceedings suffer from delay as the same has been initiated after 8 years of the violation. In this regard I note from the record that the period of the investigation is December 15, 2011 to October 09, 2014. Further, the investigating officer was appointed on July 15, 2016. Pursuant to completion of investigation, action of adjudication proceeding was approved by competent authority on April 26, 2019 and thereafter, the erstwhile AO was appointed on July 31, 2019. The erstwhile sought certain clarification from SEBI and in the meantime pursuant to the transfer of the erstwhile AO the matter was assigned to the undersigned on January 07, 2020. After receiving the clarification in the month of April 2020 the SCN dated July 16, 2020 was issued to the Noticee. From the above details it is observed that there is apparently no delay in initiating the proceedings. In support of my findings on the issue of delay raised by the Noticee, I observe that in the case of Ravi Mohan & Ors. Vs. SEBI (SAT Appeal No. 97 of 2014 decided on 16.12.2015), Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT while referring to its own decision in HB StockHoldings case (Appeal no. 112 of 2013 decided on August 08, 2013) and decision of_______________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in respect of Garware Polyester Limited  Page 5 of 10 Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in Collector of Central Excise, New Delhi vs. Bhagsons Paint Industry (India) reported in 2003 (158) ELT 129 (S.C.), held as under: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026Based on decision of this Tribunal in case of HB Stockholdings Ltd. vs. SEBI (Appeal no. 114 of 2012 decided on 27.08.2013) it is contended on behalf of the appellants that in view of the delay of more than 8 years in issuing the show cause notice, the impugned order is liable to be quashed and set aside. There is no merit in this contention, because, this Tribunal while setting aside the decision of SEBI on merits has clearly held in para 20 of the order, that delay itself may not be fatal in each and every case. Moreover, the Apex Court in case of Collector of Central Excise, New Delhi vs. Bhagsons Paint Industry (India) reported in 2003 (158) ELT 129 (S.C) has held that if there no statutory bar for adjudicating the matter beyond a particular date, the Tribunal cannot set aside the adjudication order merely on the ground that the adjudication order is passed after a lapse of several years from the date of issuing notice\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  12. The Noticee further contended that the percentage of acquisition by the promoter-directors were very miniscule and therefore, it could have been missed out by the Noticee and upon discovering the same the Noticee made voluntarily disclosure to Stock Exchange(s). The contention of the Noticee is not accepted because there are 38 instances of acquisitions of shares by no other than the promoter-directors of the company, and by no imagination these many numbers of acquisitions can be regarded as miniscule. Further, as regards to the contention that the Noticee on its own made disclosures to the stock exchanges, I observe that the regulation 13(6) of the PIT Regulations cast an obligation on the Noticee to make disclosures on compulsory basis to the Exchanges within two working days of receipt of the disclosures received under sub regulation of 13(1), (2), (3) and (4) of the PIT Regulation. Thus, I reject the contention of the Noticee.  13. The Noticee has contended that the violation relates to the year of 2012, when the relevant regulations were the PIT Regulations, 1992. These regulations were repealed in 2015, and the SCN has been issued five year after the repeal of PIT Regulation 1992, i.e. in July 2020. The Noticee contended that it is only \\\\\\\\u2018anything done\\\\\\\\u2019 or \\\\\\\\u2018any action taken\\\\\\\\u2019 under the PIT Regulation 1992 that would be saved by the repeal and saving provisions under the PIT Regulations 2015. In this regard I note from the regulation 12 of the PIT Regulation 2015 that the Noticee is reading the repeal regulation in part only i.e., only the regulation 12(2)(b) of the PIT Regulation 2015. In this regard, it is important to refer to the regulation 12(2)(a) of the PIT Regulation 2015, as under: Repeal and Savings. 12(2) Notwithstanding such repeal-_______________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in respect of Garware Polyester Limited  Page 6 of 10 (a) the previous operation of the repealed regulations or anything duly done or suffered thereunder, any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the repealed regulations, any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against the repealed regulations, or any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid, shall remain unaffected as if the repealed regulations had never been repealed; From the above it is clear that any obligation or liability acquired under the repealed regulations shall remain unaffected as if the repealed regulations i.e., PIT Regulation 1992 had not been repealed. In this matter the obligation to disclose had already arisen in 2012 and therefore the same shall remain unaffected as if the repealed regulations had never been repealed. Therefore, I reject the contention of the Noticee.  14. The Noticee has contended that considering the lapse of time in issuing the SCN coupled with the voluntary disclosure made by the Noticee, the present case is a fit case where a warning or a disposal without penalty would meet the ends of justice, while imposition of penalty on an SCN issued after a period of 8 years, and that too when in fact there has been no problem/ allegation of whatsoever nature between 2012 and 2020, would be unfair and unjust. In view thereof, the alleged violations by the Noticee does not warrant any penalty. In this regard I note that as per regulation 13(6) of the PIT Regulation it is obligatory on the part of the listed company to make disclosure to the Stock Exchange/s where the shares of the company are listed. In the instant proceedings, on perusal from the record as submitted by GPL/BSE/NSE, it is evident and also admitted position that the Noticee had made delayed disclosures to the stock exchanges. Therefore, the Noticee have violated the provision of regulation 13(6) of the PIT Regulations.  15. The Noticee has also relied upon the principles of law laid down by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Adjudicating Officer, Securities and Exchange Board of India Vs. Bhavesh Pabari [(2019) 5 SCC 90] and by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the case of Piramal Enterprises Limited Vs. Securities Exchange Board of India, decided on 15th May 2019 and submitted that it would be unnecessary to impose monetary penalty in the facts of the case. In this regard I note that the findings of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of Bhavesh Pabri (supra) confirms the discretion vested on AO by section 15J of the SEBI Act to decide the quantum of penalty.  In the said ruling the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court also held that the factors enumerated under section 15-J are not exhaustive but rather illustrative factors to be taken into account by the AO while adjudging the quantum of penalty to be imposed under Section 15-I and that the AO may take_______________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in respect of Garware Polyester Limited  Page 7 of 10 note of other factors as well, in the same analysis. There is no doubt that the AO while adjudging the matter is bound by the guidance under section 15J of the SEBI Act. Further, recently the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of Securities and Exchange Board of India Vs. Bharti Goyal Etc. (Appeal No. 3596-35297/2020) in its order dated January 05, 2021 held that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026Prime facie, the direction for substituting the penalty which has been imposed under section 15HA with a warning is contrary to the statutory provisions\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, it is also important to quote the observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI vs. Shri Ram Mutual Fund [2006] 68 SCL 216(SC), wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, inter alia, held that: \\\\\\\\u201conce the violation of statutory regulations is established, imposition of penalty becomes sine qua non of violation and the intention of parties committing such violation becomes totally irrelevant. Once the contravention is established then the penalty is to follow.\\\\\\\\u201d   16. It is pertinent to mention that the disclosures requirements under the respective regulations serve very important purposes. The stock exchange is informed so that the investing public will come to know of the position enabling them to stick on with or exit from the company. Timely disclosures of the details of the shareholding of the persons acquiring/transferring substantial stake is of significant importance as such disclosures also enable the regulators to monitor such acquisitions. Hon'ble SAT in the matter of Coimbatore Flavors & Fragrances Ltd. vs SEBI (Appeal No. 209 of 2014 order dated August 11, 2014), has held that \\\\\\\\u201cUndoubtedly, the purpose of these disclosures is to bring about more transparency in the affairs of the companies. True and timely disclosures by a company or its promoters are very essential from two angles. Firstly; investors can take a more informed decision to invest or not to invest in a particular scrip secondly; the Regulator can properly monitor the transactions in the capital market to effectively regulate the same.\" Further in the matter of Appeal No. 66 of 2003 -Milan Mahendra Securities Pvt. Ltd. vs. SEBI\\\\\\\\u2013the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT, vide its order dated April 15, 2005 also held  that, \\\\\\\\u201cthe purpose of these disclosures is to bring about transparency in the transactions and assist the Regulator to effectively monitor the transactions in the market.\\\\\\\\u201d  In the facts and circumstances of this case, the failure to make disclosure as found in this case would defeat the purpose of the provisions of regulation 13(6) of the PIT Regulations. The statutory timelines stipulated in regulation 13(6) of the PIT Regulations is mandatory. Considering these facts and circumstances, I hold that this case deserves imposition of monetary penalty upon the Noticee under Section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act which reads as under:-  Penalties and Adjudication Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. 15A. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder,\\\\\\\\u2014_______________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in respect of Garware Polyester Limited  Page 8 of 10 (a)\\\\\\\\u2026 (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations or who furnishes or files false, incorrect or incomplete information, return, report, books or other documents, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues subject to a maximum of one crore rupees.  17. Further, in these facts and circumstances of the case, the quantum of penalty has to be adjudged taking into account the conduct of the Noticee as found in this case and the principle of proportionality. For the purpose of adjudging the quantum of penalty it is relevant to mention that under section 15I of the SEBI Act imposition of penalty is linked to the subjective satisfaction of the Adjudicating Officer. The words in the section that \"he may impose such penalty\" are of considerable significance, especially in view of the guidelines provided by the legislature in section 15J of the SEBI Act. Further, while adjudging the quantum of penalty the adjudicating officer has discretion and such discretion should be exercised having due regard to the factors specified in section 15J. The factors stipulated in Section 15J, which reads as follows:-  \\\\\\\\u201c15J \\\\\\\\u2010 Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15\\\\\\\\u2010I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:\\\\\\\\u2010 (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investor/+s as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.  Explanation- For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E,clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.\\\\\\\\u201d  18. Having regard to the factors listed in section 15J, it is noted that it is not possible to determine the consequent loss caused to investors as a result of the default as found in this case. However, in the facts and circumstances of this case, I deem it worth relying the observations of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble_______________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in respect of Garware Polyester Limited  Page 9 of 10 SAT, vide its order dated June 09, 2014 in the matter of Ashok Jain v/s SEBI (Appeal No. 79 of 2014) wherein it was held that - \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026disclosures have to be made irrespective of whether investors have suffered any loss or not on account of non-disclosure within the time stipulated under those regulations\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, in the present case, the default has occurred several times, and as such the default is repetitive in nature. I also note that the Noticee has made delayed disclosures to exchange ranging from 27 days to 193 days which is substantial in nature. By making such a delayed disclosures no purpose of disclosure is served.  19. I note that the disclosures mandated in regulation 13(6) of the PIT Regulations, 1992, are significant in nature as they apply to a listed company.  I also note that the timelines of this disclosures were amended in the PIT Regulations on November 19, 2008, wherein the timelines for making disclosures by the company to exchanges were reduced from \\\\\\\\u2018within five days\\\\\\\\u2019 to \\\\\\\\u2018within two working days\\\\\\\\u2019. By reducing the timelines from 5 days to 2 working days, it is evident that such a disclosure was a material and important one, which needed to be disclosed expeditiously. Hence, the disclosures requirement under regulation 13(6) of the PIT Regulations has to be seen from different perspective than the general disclosures to be made by another category of person. It is also important to note that the acquisitions were made by the promoter-directors of the Noticee, wherein most of them were repetitively making acquisitions of shares, with every time the shares value triggering the disclosure requirement. Such acquisition certainly were material information which needed to be timely disclosed by the company. It is also observed that there are 38 instances of such failures on the part of the Noticee. The repetitive failure to disclose as found in this case have created information asymmetry, at relevant time and defeated the purpose of the disclosure provisions. In my view timely disclosures of the details of the shareholding of the promoter-directors of the Company acquiring substantial stake in the Company is of significant importance from the point of view of the investors, as such information received by them in a time bound manner would facilitate them in taking an informed investment decision and the requirements also enable the regulators to monitor such acquisitions.  20. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the mitigating factors and exercising the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby impose a consolidated monetary penalty of \\\\\\\\u20b938,00,000/ (Rupees Thirty Eight Lakh only) upon Noticee viz. Garware Polyester Limited under section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, 1992, for the violation of regulation 13(6) of the PIT Regulations, 1992. In my view, the said penalty is commensurate with the violation committed by the Noticee in this case._______________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order in respect of Garware Polyester Limited  Page 10 of 10 21.

January 14, 2021\\\\\\\\nOFAC Settles with PT Bukit Muria Jaya for Its Potential Civil Liability\\\\\\\\nfor Apparent Violations of the North Korea Sanctions Regulations\\\\\\\\nPT Bukit Muria Jaya (BMJ), a paper products manufacturer located in Indonesia, has agreed to\\\\\\\\npay $1,016,000 to settle its potential civil liability for 28 apparent violations that arose from its\\\\\\\\nexportation of cigarette paper to the Democratic People\\\\\\\\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).  BMJ\\\\\\\\ndirected payments for these exports to its U.S. dollar bank account at a non-U.S. bank, which\\\\\\\\ncaused U.S. banks to clear wire transfers related to these shipments, including shipments made to\\\\\\\\na blocked North Korean person.  This settlement amount reflects OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s determination that\\\\\\\\nBMJ\\\\\\\\u2019s conduct was non-egregious and accounts for BMJ\\\\\\\\u2019s remedial response.  This case further\\\\\\\\nhighlights the risks to non-U.S. persons who involve the U.S. financial system in commercial\\\\\\\\nactivity with an OFAC-sanctioned country, region, or person.\\\\\\\\nConduct Leading to the Apparent Violations\\\\\\\\nBMJ exported cigarette paper to entities located in or doing business on behalf of the DPRK,\\\\\\\\nincluding to an intermediary in China that procured cigarette paper from BMJ on behalf of\\\\\\\\nOFAC-designated Korea Daesong General Trading Corporation (\\\\\\\\u201cDaesong\\\\\\\\u201d) while Daesong was\\\\\\\\noperating under an alias.1  BMJ initially referenced DPRK entities on its transactional\\\\\\\\ndocuments, but at the request of its customers certain BMJ sales employees later replaced such\\\\\\\\nreferences with the names of intermediaries located in third countries, including on invoices,\\\\\\\\npacking lists, and bills of lading.  The approximate commercial value of BMJ\\\\\\\\u2019s exports to the\\\\\\\\nDPRK was $959,111.\\\\\\\\nBMJ directed payments for its DPRK-related exports to its U.S. dollar bank account at a non-\\\\\\\\nU.S. bank.  This caused 28 wire transfers related to such exports to clear through U.S. banks\\\\\\\\nbetween March 2016 and May 2018.  Accordingly, BMJ appears to have violated \\\\\\\\xa7 510.212 of\\\\\\\\nthe North Korea Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 510 (NKSR), when it caused U.S. banks\\\\\\\\nto: (i) deal in the property or interests in property of a Specially Designated National or Blocked\\\\\\\\nPerson; (ii) export financial services to the DPRK; or (iii) otherwise facilitate export transactions\\\\\\\\nthat would have been prohibited if engaged in by U.S. persons in apparent violation of\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\xa7\\\\\\\\xa7 510.201, 510.206, and 510.211 of the NKSR (the \\\\\\\\u201cApparent Violations\\\\\\\\u201d).\\\\\\\\nAfter learning of its exposure to U.S. sanctions laws and regulations, BMJ represented that it\\\\\\\\nceased all dealings involving the DPRK and adopted a formal written sanctions policy and\\\\\\\\ncompliance procedures, as more fully described below.\\\\\\\\n1 Daesong, a DPRK entity, was designated by OFAC pursuant to Executive Order 13551 on November 18, 2010 for\\\\\\\\nbeing owned or controlled by Office 39 of the Korean Workers\\\\\\\\u2019 Party.  Treasury Department Press Release:\\\\\\\\nhttps://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/tg962.aspx2\\\\\\\\nPenalty Calculations and General Factors Analysis\\\\\\\\nThe statutory maximum civil monetary penalty applicable in this matter is $8,621,816.  OFAC\\\\\\\\ndetermined that BMJ did not voluntarily self-disclose the Apparent Violations and that the\\\\\\\\nApparent Violations constitute a non-egregious case.  Accordingly, under OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s Economic\\\\\\\\nSanctions Enforcement Guidelines (\\\\\\\\u201cEnforcement Guidelines\\\\\\\\u201d), the base civil monetary penalty\\\\\\\\namount applicable in this matter is $1,270,000.\\\\\\\\nThe settlement amount of $1,016,000 reflects OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s consideration of the General Factors\\\\\\\\nunder the Enforcement Guidelines.\\\\\\\\nOFAC determined the following to be aggravating factors:\\\\\\\\n(1) BMJ acted with reckless disregard for U.S. sanctions laws and regulations when it\\\\\\\\ndirected payments related to DPRK trade activity to its U.S. dollar account at a non-U.S.\\\\\\\\nbank;\\\\\\\\n(2) BMJ management had actual knowledge that the conduct at issue concerned the sale of\\\\\\\\ncigarette paper to the DPRK and that certain BMJ sales employees omitted the DPRK\\\\\\\\nnexus from transactional documents; and\\\\\\\\n(3) BMJ significantly harmed U.S. foreign policy objectives when it caused U.S. persons to\\\\\\\\nconfer economic benefits to the DPRK and an OFAC-designated person.\\\\\\\\nOFAC determined the following to be mitigating factors:\\\\\\\\n(1) BMJ has not received a Penalty Notice or Finding of Violation from OFAC in the five\\\\\\\\nyears preceding the date of the earliest transaction giving rise to the Apparent Violations,\\\\\\\\nand the transactions giving rise to the Apparent Violations represent a small percentage\\\\\\\\nof BMJ\\\\\\\\u2019s overall business during the relevant time period;\\\\\\\\n(2) BMJ cooperated with OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s investigation by providing detailed and well-organized\\\\\\\\nsubmissions in response to requests for information, and agreed to provide ongoing\\\\\\\\ncooperation as a term of settlement; and\\\\\\\\n(3) BMJ\\\\\\\\u2019s remedial response to the Apparent Violations consisting of representations that it\\\\\\\\nhas ceased all dealings with the DPRK and implemented a new sanctions compliance\\\\\\\\nprogram that includes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 A new head of the Compliance Department who reports directly to the company\\\\\\\\u2019s\\\\\\\\npresident, and statements from the Chief Executive Officer to company employees\\\\\\\\nencouraging them to report compliance concerns;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 Procurement of sanctions screening services from a third-party provider;3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 A formal written export control and sanctions policy that includes guidance for\\\\\\\\ncompliance with U.S. sanctions and identifies red flags to educate employees when to\\\\\\\\ncontact BMJ\\\\\\\\u2019s compliance division for further assessment;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 A know-your-customer process that provides for escalation and risk-based review,\\\\\\\\nincluding consultation with external counsel or background checks, if heightened\\\\\\\\nrisks are identified; and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 A requirement that all trading companies or agents who purchase goods on behalf of\\\\\\\\nother end-users sign an anti-diversion agreement that includes OFAC sanctions\\\\\\\\ncompliance commitments.\\\\\\\\nBMJ\\\\\\\\u2019s obligation to pay OFAC the settlement amount shall be deemed satisfied by BMJ\\\\\\\\u2019s\\\\\\\\npayment of a greater amount in satisfaction of penalties assessed by the U.S. Department of\\\\\\\\nJustice arising from the same course of conduct.\\\\\\\\nCompliance Considerations\\\\\\\\nAs described in OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s A Framework for Compliance Commitments (the \\\\\\\\u201cFramework\\\\\\\\u201d), many\\\\\\\\nnon-U.S. persons have engaged in violations of OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s regulations by causing U.S. persons to\\\\\\\\nengage in prohibited transactions.  All persons, including non-U.S. persons, engaged in\\\\\\\\ninternational trade and commerce should be aware of sanctions prohibitions applicable to non-\\\\\\\\nU.S. persons who involve U.S. persons in such transactions.\\\\\\\\nThese circumstances can arise when financial transactions that pertain to commercial activity\\\\\\\\nwith an OFAC-sanctioned country, region, or person are processed through or involve U.S.\\\\\\\\nfinancial institutions.  Involving a U.S. financial institution in such commercial activity\\\\\\\\u2014\\\\\\\\nincluding the shipment of goods to or from a third-country to an OFAC-sanctioned country\\\\\\\\u2014\\\\\\\\nmay cause violations of OFAC regulations, such as the prohibited exportation or reexportation of\\\\\\\\nservices from the United States, or by U.S. persons, to a comprehensively sanctioned\\\\\\\\njurisdiction.\\\\\\\\nFor companies engaged in trade with international partners, the absence of a risk-based sanctions\\\\\\\\ncompliance program may contribute to the likelihood of committing such a violation.  This risk\\\\\\\\nmay be particularly acute when dealing with DPRK companies and individuals, or those who\\\\\\\\nmay be acting on their behalf, given the DPRK\\\\\\\\u2019s widespread efforts to evade U.S. and\\\\\\\\ninternational sanctions.\\\\\\\\nOFAC Enforcement and Compliance Resources\\\\\\\\nOn May 2, 2019, OFAC published the Framework in order to provide organizations subject to\\\\\\\\nU.S. jurisdiction, as well as foreign entities that conduct business in or with the United States or\\\\\\\\nU.S. persons, or that use U.S.-origin goods or services, with OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s perspective on the essential\\\\\\\\ncomponents of a sanctions compliance program.  The Framework also outlines how OFAC may\\\\\\\\nincorporate these components into its evaluation of apparent violations and resolution of\\\\\\\\ninvestigations resulting in settlements.  The Framework includes an appendix that offers a brief4\\\\\\\\nanalysis of some of the root causes of apparent violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions\\\\\\\\nprograms OFAC has identified during its investigative process.\\\\\\\\nInformation concerning the civil penalties process can be found in the OFAC regulations\\\\\\\\ngoverning each sanctions program; the Reporting, Procedures, and Penalties Regulations, 31\\\\\\\\nC.F.R. part 501; and the Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R. part 501, app.\\\\\\\\nA.

Thus, the present proceedings are covered by the moratorium granted vide the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT.  5.6. The decision of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the case of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited v. SEBI, is applicable in the present case:  5.6.1. A moratorium (albeit under Section 14 of the IBC) was operative when SEBI issued a SCN to institute proceedings for violations under securities laws. Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                     Page 5 of 26   5.6.2. The board of directors of Dewan Housing had been suspended and an administrator had been appointed to resolve Dewan Housing. 5.6.3. SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s argument that a moratorium order (i) does not prevent the adjudicating officer from determining the liability of the corporate debtor; and (ii) is only applicable to enforcement/recovery of determined liability, was rejected by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT. 5.6.4. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT has held that once a moratorium is declared (albeit under Section 14 of the IBC), SEBI/AO will have no jurisdiction to institute any proceedings and where proceedings have already been initiated/instituted, it will be prohibited from continuing with such proceedings. Instituting and/or continuing proceedings despite the existence of a moratorium order may amount to contempt of court.   5.7. In the instant case, the SCN was issued on December 09, 2019, i.e., after the moratorium order dated October 15, 2018 (as confirmed by the order dated March 12, 2020), was issued. Hence, the institution/ commencement of these proceedings is without jurisdiction. In any case, the moratorium order would have the effect of taking away the jurisdiction of SEBI to adjudicate on the issues under SCN.  6. In view of the above submissions, the Noticee prayed that SEBI should first pass an order deciding whether it has the jurisdiction to adjudicate on the issues under the SCN in view of the moratorium order against IL&FS Group and its subsidiaries. It was further submitted that the Noticee has been instructed not to appear before SEBI to argue on the matter on merits unless an order deciding the jurisdiction is first passed.   ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION:  7. I have perused the submissions made by the Noticee. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case and the orders of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT, I note that it would be appropriate to first determine whether SEBI has the jurisdiction to adjudicate the Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                     Page 6 of 26   proceedings in the SCN. Hence, the present order is limited only to the issue of whether SEBI has the jurisdiction to proceed with the instant SCN in view of the NCLAT order dated October 15, 2018, which was confirmed on March 12, 2020.    8. At the outset, it is noted that the SEBI Board has been established under Section 3 of the SEBI Act as a statutory Regulatory Authority. It is further noted that the Board consists of a Chairman and other members as stipulated under Section 4 of the SEBI Act, which also includes Whole Time Members (WTMs). The WTMs discharge the functions of the Board as delegated to them under Section 19 of the SEBI Act. In the sphere of delegated powers, the performance of the duties by the WTMs is equivalent to the performance of the duties of the Board/ SEBI. As the instant proceedings are conducted under the delegated powers under Section 19 of the SEBI Act, the act of the WTM is equivalent to the act of the Board/ SEBI. Hence, SEBI and WTM of SEBI have been used interchangeably in this Order.  Key Issue: Whether SEBI has the jurisdiction to adjudicate the proceedings in the current SCN in view of the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT?  9. In order to determine the above mentioned key issue, I note that the following sub-issues need to be determined first:  9.1. Whether Regulatory Authorities are directly covered under the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT?  9.2. If not, whether SEBI is a Tribunal and/ or is a deemed Tribunal?  9.2.1. Whether there are any key features of a tribunal that can be culled out from relevant court pronouncements.  9.2.2. If so, whether SEBI, as a statutory Regulatory Authority, has these key features? Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                     Page 7 of 26   9.3. Even if the answer to issues at either paragraphs 9.1 or 9.2 above is in the affirmative, whether the current proceedings come under the sweep of the term \\\\\\\\u2018proceedings\\\\\\\\u2019 mentioned in the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT?  Whether Regulatory Authorities are directly covered under the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT?  10. I note that the October 15, 2018, order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT has been passed in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 242(1)(b) read with Section 242(2)(m) and Section 242(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 11 of the National Company Law Tribunal Rules, 2016, and is an order similar but not identical to an order under Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cIBC\\\\\\\\u201d).   11. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the relevant extract of the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT dated October 15, 2018:  \\\\\\\\u201cTaking into consideration the nature of the case, larger public interest and economy of the nation and interest of the Company and 348 group companies, there shall be stay of   (i) The institution or continuation of suits or any other proceedings by any party or person or Bank or Company, etc. against \\\\\\\\u2018IL&FS\\\\\\\\u2019 and its 348 group companies in any Court of Law/Tribunal/Arbitration Panel or Arbitration Authority; and\\\\\\\\u201d   12. A bare reading of the direction mentioned above indicates that there shall be a stay on the \\\\\\\\u201cinstitution of any other proceedings\\\\\\\\u201d by \\\\\\\\u201cany party or person\\\\\\\\u201d against IL&FS and its group companies, which includes the Noticee, in any \\\\\\\\u201cCourt of Law/ Tribunal/ Arbitration Panel or Arbitration Authority\\\\\\\\u201d. In other words, the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                     Page 8 of 26   NCLAT prevents institution of proceedings by any party/ person against the Noticee before a Court of Law, Tribunal, Arbitration Panel or Arbitration Authority.   13. I note here that the present proceedings initiated vide SCN dated December 09, 2019, have not been initiated by any party/ person against the Noticee before a Court of Law, Tribunal, Arbitration Panel or Arbitration Authority. I note here that while the Companies Act, 2013, does not define the word \\\\\\\\u201cperson\\\\\\\\u201d, in absence of the same, I refer to the definition of \\\\\\\\u201cperson\\\\\\\\u201d under the General Clauses Act, 1897, wherein \\\\\\\\u201cperson\\\\\\\\u201d shall \\\\\\\\u201cinclude any company or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not\\\\\\\\u201d. I note here that SEBI does not fall within this definition of \\\\\\\\u201cperson\\\\\\\\u201d. I also note here that there is no third party which has initiated the proceedings against the Noticee before SEBI.   14. Further, I note that the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT has held that it has the powers to pass an order of moratorium similar to an order under Section 14 of the IBC. However, here, I would like to refer to the relevant extract of Section 14 of the IBC, which is reproduced below:  14. (1) Subject to provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3), on the insolvency commencement date, the Adjudicating Authority shall by order declare moratorium for prohibiting all of the following, namely:\\\\\\\\u2014   (a) the institution of suits or continuation of pending suits or proceedings against the corporate debtor including execution of any judgment, decree or order in any court of law, tribunal, arbitration panel or other authority; (emphasis supplied)   15. From the above, it is clear that for the purpose of moratorium, even the IBC recognizes that \\\\\\\\u201ctribunals\\\\\\\\u201d are different from \\\\\\\\u201cstatutory and regulatory authorities\\\\\\\\u201d, as Section 14 provides for both \\\\\\\\u201ctribunals\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cother authorities\\\\\\\\u201d. Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                     Page 9 of 26   16. Reading the relevant operative part of the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT and Section 14(1)(a) of the IBC, it is clear that the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT has conspicuously not covered \\\\\\\\u201cother authorities\\\\\\\\u201d within the ambit of its order. I also note here that the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT has recorded in its confirmatory order dated March 12, 2020, that its interim order dated October 15, 2018, does not require any modification/ recall.   17. Hence, I note that SEBI, as a statutory Regulatory Authority, is not covered under the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT.  Whether SEBI is a Tribunal and/ or is a deemed Tribunal?  18. As per the text of Section 14(1)(a) of the IBC, SEBI as a forum gets covered only under \\\\\\\\u201cother authorities\\\\\\\\u201d as it is not a court of law, arbitration panel or a tribunal. However, the Noticee has contended that in the present proceedings, SEBI is a Tribunal and/ or is deemed to be a Tribunal and hence, these proceedings are covered under the order of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble NCLAT.   19. The thrust of the argument of the Noticee is that when a statutory authority who is empowered to take a decision affecting the rights of persons and is required to make enquiry and hear the parties before taking such a decision, then such an authority is quasi-judicial and the decision rendered by it is a quasi-judicial act. The Noticee submitted the relevant paras of the 272nd Report on the \\\\\\\\u201cAssessment of Statutory Frameworks of Tribunals in India\\\\\\\\u201d prepared by the Law Commission of India (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201c272nd Law Report\\\\\\\\u201d) in support of the same. Elaborating this argument, it was further argued that if a statutory authority has the power to do an act which will prejudicially affect the subject, then, the final determination of the authority is quasi-judicial in nature, whether there are two parties before it or the contest is between the statutory authority proposing to do the act and subject is opposing it. The Noticee submitted the decision of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court Constitutional Bench (6 Judge Bench) in the Province of Bombay v. Kusaldas S. Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                     Page 10 of 26   Advani & Ors. AIR 1950 SC 222 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cKusaldas judgment\\\\\\\\u201d) in support of this proposition.   20. Extending further, the Noticee argued that anybody or any authority which is tasked with the discharge of quasi-judicial function or has the \\\\\\\\u201ctrappings of a court\\\\\\\\u201d, falls within the definition of \\\\\\\\u201ctribunal\\\\\\\\u201d. In order to buttress this position, the Noticee submitted certain case laws, such as, judgments of the Constitutional Bench (5 Judge Bench) of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of Rojer Mathew v. South India Bank Limited & Ors. 2019 (15) (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cRojer Mathew judgment\\\\\\\\u201d) and in the matter of Engineering Mazdoor Sabha Representing Workmen Employed Under the Hind Cycles Ltd. and Ors. vs. The Hind Cycles Ltd., Bombay AIR 1963 SC 874 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cMazdoor Sabha judgment\\\\\\\\u201d). The Noticee has also referred to certain extracts from the 272nd Law Report. Therefore, it needs to be examined whether SEBI is a Tribunal and/ or is a deemed Tribunal.  21. In view of the above submission, I proceed to examine and test the basis of the submission and applicability of the judgments cited in support of its arguments. In order to appreciate the essential features of a tribunal, we need to see how the tribunals have been created in order to substitute courts. It further needs to be examined, whether there are common features between courts and tribunals. It also needs to be seen how, during the evolution of tribunals, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India has raised concerns, for bringing parity between the features of an \\\\\\\\u201cindependent judiciary\\\\\\\\u201d embedded in the courts, within the tribunals.  Whether there are any key features of a tribunal that can be culled out from relevant court pronouncements.  22. In this context, reference may be made to the decision of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of State of Gujarat & ANR. Vs. Gujarat Revenue Tribunal Bar Association & ANR. [Civil Appeal No.7208 of 2012) (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cGujarat Revenue judgment\\\\\\\\u201d), which stresses on the aspect of the nature of the work Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                     Page 11 of 26   performed by tribunals, which was hitherto performed by the \\\\\\\\u201ccourts\\\\\\\\u201d. In the words of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, \\\\\\\\u201cThe legislature, in its wisdom has created tribunals and transferred the work which was regularly done by the civil courts to them, as it was found necessary to do so in order to provide efficacious remedy and also to reduce the burden on the civil courts and further, also to save the aggrieved person from bearing the burden of heavy court fees etc.\\\\\\\\u201d  A. Independence of Tribunals:  23. Since tribunals have been established in substitution of courts, the Constitution Bench of five judges of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme court in the matter of Union of India vs. R. Gandhi, President, Madras Bar Association (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cMadras Bar Association judgment\\\\\\\\u201d), while observing some concerns relating to constitution of tribunals, observed that if tribunals are established in substitution of courts, they must also possess independence, security and capacity. Additionally, with transfer of jurisdiction from a traditional court to a tribunal, it would be imperative to include members of the judiciary as presiding officers/members of the tribunal. Technical members could only be in addition to judicial members and that also only when specialized knowledge or know-how is required. Any inclusion of technical members in the absence of any discernible requirement of specialization would amount to dilution and encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary.  24. The 272nd Law Report also mentions at para 5.5, the following, \\\\\\\\u201cAs the Tribunals are vested with the judicial powers which had been hitherto vested in or exercised by Courts, the Tribunals should possess the same independence, security and capacity which are possessed by the judges. However, if the Tribunals are intended to serve an area which requires specialised knowledge or expertise, the appointment of Technical members in addition to judicial members must always be welcomed, as they can provide an input which may not be available with the judicial members. When any jurisdiction is shifted from Courts to Tribunals on the ground of pendency and delayed Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                     Page 12 of 26   Court proceedings and the jurisdiction so transferred does not involve any technical aspects requiring the assistance of experts, the Tribunals should normally have only the judicial members. But when the exercise of jurisdiction involves inquiry and decisions into technical or special aspects, the presence of Technical members would be useful and necessary\\\\\\\\u201d  25. In consonance with addressing these concerns, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of Madras Bar Association vs. Union of India (2014) (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cNTT judgment\\\\\\\\u201d), struck down the newly created National Tax Tribunal under the National Tax Tribunals Act, 2005, and observed that procedure of appointment and conditions of service of members must be akin to that of judges of the courts which were sought to be substituted by the tribunal(s).  26. The above discussion of judgments of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court and contents of the 272nd Law Report brings out that tribunals evolved as a substitute to courts. It also brings forth, the independence of tribunals as one of the essential feature of \\\\\\\\u201ctribunals\\\\\\\\u201d. In that context, the procedure of appointment and conditions of service of members of a tribunal become relevant criteria to assess the feature of independence of the tribunal.  B. Created by Statute for exercise of the judicial power of the State:  27. In order to ascertain other features of a tribunal, reference may be made to the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court in the matter of Harinagar Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Shyam Sundar Jhunjunwala & Ors., AIR 1961 SC 1669 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cHarinagar Sugar judgment\\\\\\\\u201d) which observed that \"These Tribunals have the authority of law to pronounce upon valuable rights; they act in a judicial manner and even on evidence on oath, but they are not part of the ordinary Courts of Civil Judicature. They share the exercise of the judicial power of the State, but they are brought into existence to implement some administrative policy or to determine controversies arising out of Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                     Page 13 of 26   some administrative law. They are very similar to Courts, but are not Courts.\\\\\\\\u201d (emphasis supplied)  28. Further, in the Gujarat Revenue judgment, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court observed that \\\\\\\\u201cTribunals have primarily been constituted to deal with cases under special laws and to hence provide for specialised adjudication alongside the courts. Therefore, a particular Act/set of Rules will determine whether the functions of a particular Tribunal are akin to those of the courts, which provide for the basic administration of justice.\\\\\\\\u201d (emphasis supplied)  29. Similarly in the matter of Associated Cement Companies Ltd vs P. N. Sharma And Another (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cACC judgment\\\\\\\\u201d), the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court observed \\\\\\\\u201c the State transfers its judicial functions and powers mainly to the courts established by the Constitution; but that does not affect the competence of the State, by appropriate measures, to transfer a part of its judicial powers and functions to tribunals by entrusting to them the task of adjudicating upon special matters and disputes...\\\\\\\\u201d (emphasis supplied).  30. In the ACC judgment, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court has further observed as follows:  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026According to this test, the adjudicating body must be constituted by the State and be vested with judicial functions. In other decided cases, other learned Judges conveyed the same idea in a somewhat different form; they have said that in order to be a tribunal, the body must be \"invested with .... part of the judicial functions of the State\", \"delegates of the judicial power of the State\", \"invested with the State's inherent judicial powers\", \" exercise judicial powers of the State.\"   31. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court further, stressing upon the importance of judicial functions of the State, in the matter of Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd., Meerut vs Lakshmichand And Others (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cJaswant Sugar Mills judgment\\\\\\\\u201d) observed as follows: Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                     Page 14 of 26   \\\\\\\\u201cBut every decision or order by an authority under a duty to act judicially is not subject to appeal to this Court. Under Art. 136, an appeal lies to this Court from adjudications of courts and tribunals only. Adjudication of a court or tribunal must doubtless be judicial: but every authority which by its constitution or authority specially conferred upon it is required to act judicially, is not necessarily a tribunal for the purpose of Art. 136. A tribunal, adjudication whereof is subject to appeal, must beside being under a duty to act judicially, be a body invested with the judicial power of the State.\\\\\\\\u201d (emphasis supplied)   32. A perusal of the Gujarat Revenue and ACC judgments shows that an essential feature of a \\\\\\\\u201ctribunal\\\\\\\\u201d is creation of the same under a statute and there exists the feature of the basic administration of justice and the inherent judicial power of the State, which has been transferred from courts to tribunals.    33. Thus, it is observed from the above that a key feature of tribunals is that they have been created by statute for basic administration of justice and a tribunal exercises the inherent judicial power of the State.  C. Adjudication of dispute as main function:  34. In order to ascertain other features of a tribunal, reference may be made to the The Bharat Bank Ltd., Delhi vs The Employees Of The Bharat Bank (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cBharat Bank judgment\\\\\\\\u201d), where the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, in order to determine whether an industrial tribunal is a \\\\\\\\u201ctribunal\\\\\\\\u201d or not, raised the question \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026what are the main functions of the tribunal and how it proceeds to discharge those functions\\\\\\\\u201d. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court observed that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026The main function of this tribunal is to adjudicate on industrial disputes which implies that there must be two or more parties before it with conflicting cases, and that it has also to arrive at a conclusion as to how the dispute is to be ended.\\\\\\\\u201d Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                     Page 15 of 26   35. This judgement brings out one of the other key feature of a \\\\\\\\u201ctribunal\\\\\\\\u201d that its main function is adjudicatory in nature.    D. Trappings of a court:  36. Reference is also made to the Mazdoor Sabha judgment submitted by the Noticee. The relevant observation of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme court is mentioned below:  \\\\\\\\u201cThe procedural rules which regulate the proceedings before the Tribunals and the powers conferred on them in dealing with matters brought before them, are sometimes described as the \"trappings of a court' and in determining the question as to whether a particular body or authority is a Tribunal or not, sometimes a rough and ready test is applied by enquiring whether the said body or authority is clothed with the trappings of a court.\\\\\\\\u201d  37. The feature of \\\\\\\\u201ctrappings of court\\\\\\\\u201d was further discussed in the Jaswant Sugar Mills and Roger Mathew judgements. A perusal of these judgements would show that \\\\\\\\u201ctrappings of court\\\\\\\\u201d is also one of the features of a \\\\\\\\u201ctribunal\\\\\\\\u201d. Relating to weightage of the feature of \\\\\\\\u201cexercise of inherent judicial power of state\\\\\\\\u201d over the \\\\\\\\u201ctrappings of court\\\\\\\\u201d, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, while referring to the ratio pronounced in the Bharat Bank judgment, observed in the Mazdoor Sabha judgment that \\\\\\\\u201cIt would thus be noticed that apart from the importance of the trappings of a Court, the basic and essential condition which makes an authority or a body a tribunal under Art. 136, is that it should be constituted by the State and should be invested with the State's inherent judicial power\\\\\\\\u201d. (emphasis supplied)  38. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court, in the ACC judgment, while dealing with the \\\\\\\\u201ctrappings of court\\\\\\\\u201d, further cautioned in the following lines: \\\\\\\\u201cIf it has one or more of such trappings, it may be easier to pronounce the body to be a tribunal. But we must not forget that the investiture of the trappings of a Court is not an essential attribute of a Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                     Page 16 of 26   tribunal. The basic test of a tribunal is that it is a body vested with the judicial power of the State. Unless this basic concept is borne in mind, the trappings of a Court may well become a trap and a snare for the unwary.\\\\\\\\u201d (emphasis supplied)  39. Thus, it is observed from the above that while a tribunal may have the \\\\\\\\u201ctrappings of a court\\\\\\\\u201d, the same is not an essential feature of a Tribunal.  40. All of the above discussions brings to the fore the following features of a \\\\\\\\u201ctribunal\\\\\\\\u201d:  40.1. Independence of tribunal, including appointment/ removal of members. 40.2. Created by Statute for exercise of the judicial power of the State. 40.3. Adjudication of dispute as its main function.  41. Further, the above discussions also show that \\\\\\\\u201ctrappings of a court\\\\\\\\u201d is an incidental but not an essential feature of a tribunal.   If so, whether SEBI, as a statutory Regulatory Authority, has these key features?  42. After having ascertained the basic features of a tribunal, I now proceed to examine whether SEBI/ the Whole-Time Member (WTM) of SEBI satisfies the basic requirements of a tribunal.  43. In this context, it is noted that the Securities and Exchange Board of India is a statutory body established under the SEBI Act, 1992 (the \\\\\\\\u201cAct\\\\\\\\u201d). The preamble to the Act clearly states that it is \\\\\\\\u201cAn Act to provide for the establishment of a Board to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto\\\\\\\\u201d. The Act also provides for the composition of the Board and the procedure to be followed for appointment of members of the Board. The same Act also establishes the Securities Appellate Tribunal. Order in the matter of IL&FS Securities Services Limited                     Page 17 of 26   44. The first feature of independence may be seen through the qualifications, appointment and removal of the members of the SEBI Board. This would be scrutinised in comparison with the Securities Appellate Tribunal.  44.1.

Some of the advisory services sold by Alliance Research are Stock Cash, Stock Cash PDP, HNI Cash, Index Future, Platinum Cash Pro, Alliance Jio Cash, Stock Options, Stock Future, SFPDF, Golden Sauda, Royal Future, Energy Premium Pack etc.  6.1.3. During the inspection, proprietor of Alliance Research, Mr. Mudassir Hasan was asked to provide details of nature and risks of products sold to clients, documented process for selecting investments based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment objective and financial situation. Mr. Mudassir Hasan was also asked to provide suitability assessment policy/ criteria to assess risk reward profile of financial product based on which the services are rendered to its clients 6.1.4. Mr. Mudassir Hasan, vide his statement dated February 12, 2020 inter alia, stated that Alliance Research does not have any policy of suitability assessment of advice provided to its clients and Alliance Research has not done any suitability assessment of its clients prior to offering its services through SMS. 6.1.5. It is noted that as per Regulation 17 of IA Regulation, Alliance Research is required to have the documented process for selecting investments based on client\\\\\\\\u2019s investment objectives and financial situation. However, it is prima facie found that Alliance Research does not have any documented policy of suitability assessment of advice provided to its clients.  6.1.6. From the above, it is prima facie found that Alliance Research has sold its services to clients without knowing whether the services sold are suitable to respective clients as mandated under IA Regulations. It is also prima facie found that by selling services to clients without knowing the suitability of said services to respective clients, Alliance Research has not acted with due skill, care, diligence, honesty, fairly and in the best interest of its clients while selling products/services to its clients. It is also prima facie found the Alliance Research had failed to comply with the regulatory requirements relating to the requirement of suitability policy. In view of the same, Alliance Research__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Alliance Research and its Proprietor Mr. Mudassir Hasan                                                                                       Page 8 of 30 has prima facie (a) failed to provide the investment advice as per the risk suitability of clients in accordance with regulation 17 of IA Regulations; and (b) failed to abide by clauses 1, 2 and 8 of Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Alliance Research has prima facie violated the provision of Regulation 17 of IA Regulations and clauses 1, 2 and 8 of Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations.  6.2. KYC procedure, Risk Profiling and Suitability Assessment  6.2.1.  As per Regulation 15(8) of IA Regulation, IA is required to follow Know Your Client (KYC) procedure as specified by the Board from time to time. As per Regulation 16 of IA Regulation, IA is required to obtain information about the client which includes age, investment objective, income details, existing investments, risk appetite, liabilities, etc. based on which the risk appetite of the client can be arrived at and the quantum of risk the investor would be able take to subscribe the services of Alliance Research. As per Regulation 17 of IA Regulation, Alliance Research is required to ensure that the investment advice provided to the client is appropriate to the risk profile of the client. 6.2.2. It is noted that during the inspection, out of 46 sample clients, some details with respect to 32 sample clients were provided. However, for the remaining 14 clients namely Jitendra Kumar Yadav, Shankar Prasad Roy, Ravi Agrawal, Dharmesh, Shivam, Shrikant Vaddi, Gopal Singh, Tahirpasha Zainolabdin, K V, Sircilla Thirumalesh, Yaseem Farha, Jagat Ram, Brendon and Justin SM, the KYC, Risk Profiling Form and Suitability Assessment were not provided.  6.2.3. Mr. Mudassir Hasan, vide his statement dated February 13, 2020 stated that the services to the said 14 clients have been provided without carrying out KYC, Risk Profiling and Suitability Assessment. Thus, it is prima facie found that Alliance Research has not done KYC, Risk Profiling and Suitability Assessment for aforesaid 14 clients. 6.2.4. Thus, from above it is prima facie found Alliance Research had provided the services to these 14 clients without carrying out KYC, Risk Profiling of clients and suitability assessment of services. It is also prima facie found that by not carrying out KYC, Risk__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Alliance Research and its Proprietor Mr. Mudassir Hasan                                                                                       Page 9 of 30 Profiling of clients and suitability assessment of services, Alliance Research has not acted with due skill, care, diligence, honesty, fairly and in the best interest of its clients while selling products/services to its clients. In view of the same, Alliance Research has prima facie (a) failed to carry out KYC requirements of clients in accordance with Regulation 15(8) of IA Regulations; (b) failed to carry out Risk Profiling of clients in accordance with Regulation 16 of IA Regulations; (c) failed to carry out risk suitability assessment of services provided to its clients in accordance with Regulation 17 of IA Regulations; and (d) failed to abide by clauses 1 and 2 of Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Alliance Research has prima facie violated the provision of Regulations 15(8), 16 and 17 of IA Regulations and clauses 1 and 2 of Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations.  6.3. Risk profiling and Non-communication of risk profile to clients: 6.3.1. As per Regulation 16 (a) and 16(b) of IA Regulation, IA is required to obtain information about the client which includes age, investment objective, income details, existing investments, risk appetite, liabilities, etc. for the purpose of determination and quantification of risk appetite of the client.  As per clause 4 of code of conduct read with Regulations 15(9) of IA Regulations, IA is required to seek information from its clients about their financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives before providing them investment advice / services. As per Regulation 16(e) of IA Regulations, the IA is under obligation to communicate the risk profile of the client after risk assessment is done. 6.3.2. It is noted that Alliance Research has a Risk Profiling Questionnaire with 21 questions to determine / measure risk appetite / tolerance of the clients. Corresponding to each question, a set of answers has been stated. Each answer has been assigned a particular weightage. Depending on the response of the client, the total score of the client is calculated. The maximum total score is 27. Based on the response of the clients, assigned scores are given and risk appetite of the clients is assessed. Depending on the score, Alliance Research classifies the clients into following Risk Categories__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Alliance Research and its Proprietor Mr. Mudassir Hasan                                                                                       Page 10 of 30 Risk profiling questionnaire score Risk category of client 7-12 Low 13-18 Medium 19-27 High  6.3.3. From the submission given at the time of inspection i.e. write up on the process followed for on-boarding clients, I note that the Alliance Research does not meet the client personally and all communications are exchanged through telephonic conversation and email communications. Alliance Research has further submitted that while carrying out client on-boarding exercise they only collect KYC documents like copies of Pan card, Aadhar card, id proof, address proof, passport size photograph through its WhatsApp number mentioned on its website.  6.3.4. During the inspection, out of 46 sample clients, Alliance Research had provided Risk Profile forms of 32 clients. For other 14 clients, Alliance Research had not provided proof of risk profiling, thus, it is prima facie observed that Alliance Research has not carried out Risk Assessment of said 14 clients. Therefore, in respect of those 14 clients, there is no evidence of having or sending the risk profile to the said clients. From the information/ documents submitted by Alliance Research for 32 clients, it is observed that for all the 32 clients, Alliance Research did not send the risk profile and risk assessment form to the client. The proof of communication of risk profile to such clients was also sought from Alliance Research. The same was not provided.  There was no email/ dispatch proof available with Alliance Research. Thus, there is no proof of that Risk Profile forms were communicated to the 32 clients either.   6.3.5. Evidence of compliance of sending the completed risk profile form,   can be considered if the completed risk profile forms have been signed by the respective clients. However, from the copies of risk profile statement/form of clients, it is noted that, the Risk Profile forms were not signed by clients and Alliance Research has a practice to crop the signature image of the client from his identity proof and place it electronically on the Risk Assessment Form. Therefore, the same cannot be considered for the compliance of requirement of sending the completed risk profile form.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Alliance Research and its Proprietor Mr. Mudassir Hasan                                                                                       Page 11 of 30 6.3.6. Thus, the client has no means to know whether information related to him has been correctly included in his / her risk profile statement and whether the Risk Assessment Form correctly reflects the risk assessment of the client, if the risk profile statement is not sent to the client.  6.3.7. The risk profiling of the client is a crucial process. The investment advice sent to the clients need to be appropriate to the risk profile of the client. Since all the information for carrying out risk profiling are obtained through telephone conversation and whats app chats, it is all the more important to send the risk profile statement to clients and clients should be given a fair amount of time to revert or raise objection in case of any disagreement with the risk profiling statement. 6.3.8. Therefore it is prima facie found that from the 46 sample clients, Alliance Research has not carried out Risk Assessment of 14 clients and has not communicated risk profile form for 32 clients and Alliance Research had sold the products to its clients without following due procedure mandated under IA Regulations. 6.3.9. Thus, from the above it is prima facie found that Alliance Research has conducted risk profile for certain clients on phone / whatsapp and has not sent risk profile statements / forms to the clients; the clients has no means to know whether correct information related to them has been included in the risk profile statement or not and Alliance Research had sold the products to its clients without following due procedure mandated under IA Regulations. Thereby, Alliance Research has not acted with honesty, fairness and in the best interest of its clients; and has not made the adequate disclosures of relevant material information while dealing with its clients to its clients. In view of the same, Alliance Research has prima facie (a) failed to sent risk profile statements / forms to the clients in accordance with Regulation 16(e) of IA Regulations; and (b) failed to abide by clauses 1 and 5 of Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Alliance Research has prima facie violated the provision of Regulation 16(e) and clauses 1 and 5 of Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Alliance Research and its Proprietor Mr. Mudassir Hasan                                                                                       Page 12 of 30 6.4.

From the table mentioned at paragraph 6.4.1, the products / services namely, HNI Cash, Royal Future, Alliance Jio Cash, Platinum Future, etc. have been categorized as products suitable for \\\\\\\\u2018High Risk\\\\\\\\u2019 clients, however, the same were sold to \\\\\\\\u2018Medium Risk\\\\\\\\u2019 clients. From the risk profile form of the aforesaid clients, it is observed that, despite these clients have been categorized as \\\\\\\\u2018Medium Risk\\\\\\\\u2019 by Alliance Research itself, the IA has sold products meant for \\\\\\\\u2018High Risk\\\\\\\\u2019 clients. It is noted that as per Regulation 17 of IA Regulation, \\\\\\\\u201cInvestment Adviser shall ensure that all investments on which investment advice is provided is appropriate to the risk profile of the client\\\\\\\\u201d i.e. IA is not allowed to offer high risk products to clients having medium risk appetite.    6.4.4. From the above, it is prima facie found that Alliance Research has sold products/services falling under its \\\\\\\\u2018High Risk Category\\\\\\\\u2019 to the clients falling under \\\\\\\\u2018Medium Risk Category\\\\\\\\u2019 and has not acted with due skill, care, diligence, honesty and__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Interim Order in the matter of Alliance Research and its Proprietor Mr. Mudassir Hasan                                                                                       Page 14 of 30 in the best interest of its clients while selling products/services to its clients. In view of the same, Alliance Research has prima facie (a) failed to provide the investment advice as per the risk suitability of clients in accordance with regulation 17 of IA Regulations; (b) failed in its responsibility to act in fiduciary capacity to its client which is entrusted upon it under Regulation 15(1) of IA regulation; and (c) failed to abide by clauses 1 and 2 of Code of Conduct of Schedule III read with Regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations. Thus, Alliance Research has prima facie violated the provision of clauses 1 and 2 of Code of Conduct as mentioned in Schedule III read with regulation 15(9) of IA Regulations; Regulation 15(1) and Regulation 17 of IA Regulations.  6.5.

In addition to the said collection of money in the name of GJ Advisory Services, money is also collected in the name of Profit Ideas Advisory Services through the Telegram Channel Profit Ideas and NEHA 0103. 4.2 As per the information received from the Bank Accounts mentioned on the screenshots shared by the Complainants, it is noted that Mr. Gourav Jain is the Proprietor of GJ Advisory and Ms. Poonam Jain is the Proprietor of Profit Ideas.

I have perused the materials available on record such as investor complaints, information obtained from concerned Banks and information gathered from the Telegram Channel communication from GJ Advisory and Profit Ideas. An   examination of the material available on record was made in order to verify whether GJ Advisory Services and Profit Ideas offered Portfolio Management Services and collected money from various investors without registration from SEBI.  In this context, the following prima facie issues arise for determination in the instant matter:  Issue No.1: Whether the activities of GJ Advisory and Profit Ideas are in the nature of Portfolio Management Services? Issue No.2: If answer to issue No. (i) is in affirmative, whether GJ Advisory and Profit Ideas have, prima facie, violated the provisions of section 12(1) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 3 of the PMS Regulations?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of GJ Advisory services and Profit Ideas Advisory Services    Page 4 of 18  Issue No.3: If answer to issue No. (ii) is in affirmative, who are responsible for the violations?

As regards the first issue, I note the following from the material available on record such as screenshots of Telegram Channels, documents furnished by the complainants, etc.:  6.1 From the extracts of telegram channel chats between the complainant (JD) and GJ Advisory, furnished by the complainant the following are noted: \\\\\\\\u201c \\\\\\\\u202621/03/2019, 1:11:32 PM] JD: just to want to check can we convert the remaining months fee to PMS\\\\\\\\u2026 GJ: How much is your capital available GJ: where is ur trading account JD: I can arrange 3-5 lakhs and if goes well I can put upto 10L JD: I have in upstox \\\\\\\\u2026 GJ:  Profit sharing scheme 70:30 Min Amt: 5 Lacs 30% in 3 months Ex: *on 10lacs* 3 Lacs total profit in 3 months* then 2.10 Lacs urs 90K mine.

From the perusal of such screenshots the following are observed: a. Gourav Jain had confirmed the receipt of fees for providing Portfolio Management Services.  b. Gourav Jain asked for the user ID and password of the trading accounts of the clients.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of GJ Advisory services and Profit Ideas Advisory Services    Page 6 of 18  c.

Gourav Jain also asked his clients to transfer his share of profit. e. Funds were transferred to the accounts of GJ Advisory, Profit Ideas and Mr. Gourav Jain\\\\\\\\u2019s personal account.  7. Further, I note the following information gathered from the Bank Account details, transaction documents and KYC documents collected from the banks viz., ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank : a) GJ Advisory Services has account in HDFC Bank (Account number: 50200033618449). As per the KYC documents, Mr. Gourav Jain is the sole proprietor of GJ Advisory Services. b) Mr. Gourav Jain has account in ICICI Bank (Account number : 000201091685) c) Profit Ideas Advisory Services has account in HDFC Bank (Account number: 50200038813450). As per the KYC documents, Ms. Poonam Jain is spouse of Mr. Gourav Jain and the sole proprietor of Profit Ideas.   8. Transactions observed in the abovementioned bank accounts are summarized as under: Account Name/ Authorised Signatory     Account Number & Bank     Transaction Period      Total Credits (Rs.)      No. of  credit txns.     GJ ADVISORY SERVICES / Gourav Jain, Proprietor 50200033618449  - HDFC Bank    14/09/2018 to 20/12/2020    2,76,82,842    1,949     Gourav Vijaykumar Jain/NA   000201091685  -ICICI Bank    29/05/2017 to 24/12/2020*    5,61,71,942     4,165  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of GJ Advisory services and Profit Ideas Advisory Services    Page 7 of 18  *The account is active since 15-12-2007, however the credits to the bank account with narration \"GJ Stocks\", 'Trade\", \"Stock\" etc., have been observed only since 29-05-2017 and hence period is taken from 29-05-2017. 8.1 From the analysis of Bank statements, a total of 6,686 credit transactions were made from different sources into the said accounts since May 29, 2017 and the total credit received in the aforesaid accounts is Rs.8,89,23,049/-. 8.2 Many transactions in the Bank statements of GJ Advisory and Gourav Jain have been noticed with description as Diamond Package, Options, PMS services, Guaranteed 30000 plan, and renewal for 6 months, stock fee, GJ stock call, advice charges, subscription etc. Similar narrations are also noted in the Bank Statements of Profit Ideas.  9. I have perused the definition of Portfolio Manager as given in regulation 2(cb) of PMS Regulations 1993, which states \\\\\\\\u201cportfolio manager \\\\\\\\u201cmeans any person who pursuant to a contract or arrangement with a client, advises or directs or undertakes on behalf of the client (whether as a discretionary portfolio manager or otherwise) the management or administration of a portfolio of securities or goods or the funds of the client, as the case may be\\\\\\\\u201d.  10. As per the definition of portfolio manager mentioned above, when there is a contract or arrangement between two persons to advise or direct or undertake on behalf of the other party management or administration of a portfolio of securities or the funds the first party can be called as portfolio manager. In the present case, though there is no material available on record to show that there is a formal written document between the clients Profit Ideas Advisory Services/  Poonam Jain, Proprietor   50200038813450 - HDFC Bank     23/04/2019 to 01/02/2020    50,68,264      572          Total 8,89,23,049 6,686  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of GJ Advisory services and Profit Ideas Advisory Services    Page 8 of 18  and the Noticees, the fact that a) the trading accounts ID and password has been sought from the clients, b) the same has been given by the clients for trading, c) the fact that there is a confirmation of fee received by the Noticees  d) the fact that the Noticees are seeking for their share of profit, e) the contents of the telegram channels chats with clients, f) screenshots of payments received from clients with the narrations as PMS services coupled with the credit transactions in the Bank Accounts amounting to Rs.8,89,23,049 with the narrations as PMS services as detailed in preceding paragraphs, it prima facie indicates that there is an arrangement between the clients and the Noticees to undertake the management of funds as well as securities on behalf of the clients.  11. It is well settled law that even an oral agreement can be valid and enforceable contract. Therefore, in the strict sense, it is not essential that a contract must be in writing. In this regard, I place reliance upon the various judgments of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court and High Courts in the matters of Brij Mohan And Ors vs Smt. Sugra Begum And Ors 1990 (4) SCC and Smt. Sheela Gehlot vs Smt. Sonu Kochar And Ors. decided on September 06, 2005 and Nanak Builders and Investors Pvt. Ltd. v. Vinod Kumar Alag AIR 1991 Delhi 315.  In the present case as detailed in the preceding paragraph, I note that pursuant to an arrangement through Telegram Channel communication, GJ Advisory and Profit Ideas have undertaken the management of funds as well as securities of their clients and the fees/funds were collected through the Banks Accounts of GJ Advisory and Profit Ideas since 2018 and 2019 respectively.   12. As regards the bank account of Mr. Gourav Jain with ICICI Bank is concerned, I note from the screenshots of Telegram Channels that fees towards PMS were also credited to the said account. Though the said account is active since 2007, regular credits with the narration GJ Stocks\", 'Trade\", \"Stock\" etc., were observed only from May 29, 2017. The description of credit entries, such as Diamond Package, Options, PMS services further demonstrates that the payment is prima facie, towards Portfolio Management Services rendered to its clients. In view of the above, I prima facie, find that the amounts credited  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of GJ Advisory services and Profit Ideas Advisory Services    Page 9 of 18  to the account of Mr. Gourav Jain since May 29, 2017 is considered to be fees towards providing PMS to clients.  13. Thus from the discussion in the above paragraphs, there is prima facie evidence that GJ Advisory and Profit Ideas are acting as portfolio managers and engaged in \\\\\\\\u2018portfolio management services\\\\\\\\u2019, which falls under the definition of portfolio manager as defined under Regulations 2(cb) of PMS Regulations.  Issue No: 2 If answer to issue no. (i) is in affirmative, whether GJ Advisory services and Profit Ideas Advisory Services have, prima facie, violated the provisions of section 12(1) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 3 of the PMS Regulations?  14. In order to facilitate investor protection, it is imperative that any person carrying out portfolio management services has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d Similarly, Regulation 3 of PMS Regulations also provides \"No person shall act as portfolio manager unless he holds a certificate granted by the Board under these regulations\".  15. Thus, as per regulation 3 of PMS Regulations and Section 12(1) of SEBI Act, any person acting as portfolio manager and carrying out portfolio management services has to  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of GJ Advisory services and Profit Ideas Advisory Services    Page 10 of 18  necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI regulations i.e. the registration of portfolio manager is mandatory.   16. The activities of GJ advisory and Profit Ideas as brought out from various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that GJ advisory and Profit Ideas have acted as Portfolio Manager. However, no material was available on record to indicate that GJ advisory and Profit Ideas had a certificate of registration to act as Portfolio Managers. I also note that the Proprietors of GJ advisory and Profit Ideas viz., Mr. Gourav Jain and Ms. Poonam Jain respectively are also not registered with SEBI, in their individual capacity as a Portfolio Manager or in any other capacity. Therefore, the business activity carried out by GJ advisory and Profit Ideas i.e. management of funds and securities of clients pursuant to an arrangement prima facie indicates that GJ advisory and Profit Ideas are acting as unregistered portfolio managers and are engaged in providing unregistered Portfolio Management Services.  17. I also note that by virtue of providing unregistered Portfolio Management Services, GJ advisory and Profit Ideas had collected an amount of Rs.8,89,23,049 as fees towards management of funds and securities of clients.   18. Thus, the activities GJ advisory and Profit Ideas are prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3 of PMS Regulations.  Issue No.3: If answer to issue No. (ii) is in affirmative, who are responsible for the violations? 19. I note that Mr.Gourav Jain is the sole proprietor of GJ advisory. Ms. Poonam Jain is the sole proprietor of Profit Ideas. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme court in Ashok Transport Agency v. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business. A suit by or against a proprietary concern is by  or  against  the  proprietor  of  the  business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of GJ Advisory services and Profit Ideas Advisory Services    Page 11 of 18  find that Mr.Gourav Jain is liable for the acts of GJ advisory and Ms. Poonam Jain is liable for the acts of Profit Ideas. Issue No.4:  If answer to issue No. (ii) is in affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any, should be issued against them?  20. As a regulator of capital markets, SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market. Section 11 of the SEBI Act has empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. PMS Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of regulating such activities to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of such activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. PMS Regulations inter alia seek to create a structure within which portfolio managers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their services by requiring portfolio managers to comply with the relevant provisions of the PMS Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market.   21. It is noted from material available on record that, money was credited to the Bank accounts of GJ advisory and Profit Ideas during the period of examination. This prima facie indicates that the GJ advisory and Profit Ideas are still carrying on their unregistered portfolio management services.  Since the conduct of GJ advisory and Profit Ideas as mentioned above are not, prima facie, in the interest of investors and the securities market, therefore, urgent necessary action has to be taken against GJ advisory and Profit Ideas immediately, else it may lead to loss of investors\\\\\\\\u2019 trust in the securities market. Further, in view of the facts and circumstance of the case, one cannot lose sight of the fact that the violations discussed hereinabove are ongoing which may lead to its engaging with more investors and they may continue to manage more and more money of investors. Furthermore, in case of non-redressal of investor grievances by GJ advisory and Profit Ideas, apart from the regulatory protection to investors, the normal remedies available to investors while dealing with a SEBI registered portfolio manager such as  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of GJ Advisory services and Profit Ideas Advisory Services    Page 12 of 18  invoking the grievance redressal mechanisms, referring the matters to appropriate forum such as arbitration, etc. would not be available to the investors dealing with unregistered portfolio manager. Therefore, the impact of investors getting lured and affected by the unregistered portfolio management services is still looming large and is imminent. Further, the total amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected in the bank account of GJ advisory and Profit Ideas is approximately Rs.8,89,23,049/- which also indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.  22. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive a portfolio management service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from an unqualified person without following the safeguards mentioned in the PMS Regulations. An investor receiving a service from unregistered portfolio manager not in consonance with the PMS Regulations vis a vis an investor who receives such service from registered portfolio manager following the PMS Regulations stands in a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged under the PMS regulations. An unregistered portfolio manager has not even satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as portfolio manager. Availing of services from such persons are detrimental to investors and such unqualified services could result in irreparable detriment of the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 interest as money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victim of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury to the development of the securities market also qualifies as \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d or \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable detriment\\\\\\\\u201d as the objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market.  23. Further, if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may subscribe by parting with significant fees and handing over control over their funds / securities and this may cause irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is right of the current Noitcees herein vis-a-vis  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of GJ Advisory services and Profit Ideas Advisory Services    Page 13 of 18  multitude of prospective and current clients of the Noitcees. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the \\\\\\\\u201cex-parte orders in the case of private suits\\\\\\\\u201d and \\\\\\\\u201cex-parte public enforcement actions\\\\\\\\u201d, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential loss to the investors on account of availing portfolio management services from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if prima facie unregistered portfolio management services is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing an exparte-interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favour of the Noitcees.  24. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent GJ advisory and Profit Ideas from managing any more funds from the public and indulging in unauthorized portfolio management activity. Such action needs to be taken not only to prevent any further harm to investors but also to preserve the integrity of the market.    25. As noted earlier, in the present case, prima facie violations of provision of section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3 of the PMS Regulations, have been noticed on the basis of the examination carried out by SEBI. It is pertinent to mention that several complaints have been filed against GJ advisory and Profit Ideas alleging unregistered PMS and collection of money/fees and the complainants have claimed refund of the money paid by them towards subscription of the services being offered by GJ advisory and Profit Ideas pursuant to the arrangement. One of the directions that can be passed against GJ advisory and Profit Ideas, subject to the adjudication of the allegation on the merits in the final order, under Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11B and 11D of SEBI Act is that  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of GJ Advisory services and Profit Ideas Advisory Services    Page 14 of 18  of direction to refund the money collected by GJ advisory and Profit Ideas from their clients.  26. It is noted that entities covered in this order have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by not subjecting themselves to the regulatory requirements of SEBI.  With the initiation of quasi-judicial proceedings, it is imminent that GJ advisory and Profit Ideas may divert the money collected from clients. The same may result in defeating the effective implementation of the direction of refund, if any, to be passed after deciding the matter on merits. It therefore becomes necessary for SEBI to take urgent steps to prevent GJ advisory and Profit Ideas from diverting the money collected from the clients. It is also essential to take urgent steps to prevent them from alienating any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets, so that the final remedies, if any, do not become infructuous. In view of the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove, and considering the interests of already existing clients of GJ advisory and Profit Ideas and also the interests of those who may fall prey to the unregistered portfolio management services being carried out by GJ advisory and Profit Ideas, the balance of convenience lies against GJ advisory and Profit Ideas, which requires immediate action against them including not to divert the money collected from the clients.   27. Further, as the bank accounts of GJ advisory and Mr. Gourav Jain are active, the balance of convenience demands the preventive measure of stopping the collection of money in the bank accounts of GJ advisory and Mr. Gourav Jain from investors. The same can be effectively achieved by an appropriate direction of stopping the credit into the said bank accounts.  As GJ advisory and Gourav Jain have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered portfolio manager, the balance of convenience also demands that GJ advisory and Gourav Jain are to be prevented from diverting the funds collected from the investors through the unauthorized PMS activity. Accordingly, an appropriate direction stopping debits from the bank accounts of GJ advisory and Mr. Gourav Jain have been incorporated.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interim order in the matter of GJ Advisory services and Profit Ideas Advisory Services    Page 15 of 18  Order:  28.

SEBI also received complaints from some investors enclosing debenture certificates issued by the company to certain allottees.   2. Based on the same, a preliminary examination was carried out by SEBI and it was observed that UMFIL had mobilized funds through issue of Secured Redeemable Non Convertible Debentures (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSRNCDs\\\\\\\\u201d).

The interim order found the prima facie violations of Sections 23 (1) and 26 (4) read with Section 2 (70) of the Companies Act, 2013 and Section 40 (1), 40 (3) and 71(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and provisions of SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 committed by the company and its following directors:  Noticee no.

The Noticees, may, within 21 days from the date of receipt of this interim order - cum- show cause notice, file their respective replies. The Noticees are directed to furnish an inventory of their assets in their reply. In the event the Noticees intend to avail an opportunity of personal hearing, they may do so by seeking a confirmation in writing from SEBI for the same within 45 days from the date of receipt of this Order. In the event of the Noticees failing to file replies within 21 days or requesting for an opportunity of personal hearing within the said 45 days, the preliminary findings at paras 8 to 35 of this Order and directions at para 38 (a) to (d) above shall become final and absolute against the Noticees automatically, without any further orders. The Noticees shall comply with the directions at para 38 above within a period of 90 days from the date of this Order becoming final. Upon the expiry of a period of 90 days from the date of this Order becoming final, SEBI may initiate appropriate enforcement action under SEBI Act, 1992 including, Adjudication, Prosecution and/ or Recovery in addition to making a suitable reference to State Government / Local Police. However, as regards, the amount to be refunded will depend upon the actual amount raised from the public which may not be limited to the amount filed by the company or as observed in para 10 above. To that extent the order will be subject to the aforesaid.\\\\\\\\u201d   4. None of the Noticees except Shri Sanjay Pramanik (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee no. 10\\\\\\\\u201d), and Shri Kamal Kishore Sagar hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cNoticee no. 11\\\\\\\\u201d) filed any reply within 21 days or sought personal hearing within 45 days, as directed in the interim order. Noticee no. 10 and 11 submitted letters referring to the interim order but did not make any submission regarding the allegations in the interim order.  5. An opportunity of personal hearing was granted to Noticee nos. 10 and 11 on October 15, 2020. On the said date, the Noticee nos. 10 and 11 appeared via Page 6 of 9  video conference and made submissions. Both the Noticees have submitted that they were offered jobs in the company and at that time they had given their documents to the company. These documents seem to have been misused to make them directors in the company. Both Noticees have submitted that they were only employees of the company and they are not aware as to when they were made directors in the company. Noticees have also submitted that they were not aware of any fund raising by the company during the period of their employment.  Consideration of submissions and findings:  6. I note that interim order was passed against the company and its directors, as the company was found to be prima facie in violation of the provisions of public issue norms in respect of its public issue of SRNCDs. The interim order also issued various directions to the company and its directors and also called upon them to show cause as to why appropriate directions, as mentioned in the said order be not issued against them. The interim order also provided that in case the company or its directors do not file any reply in 21 days or do not seek opportunity of hearing within 45 days, the prima facie findings recorded and directions issued, in the interim order shall become final and absolute against the Noticees therein automatically, without any further orders.   7. The company and its directors except Noticee nos. 10 and 11 have neither filed any reply to the interim order nor have sought any hearing, therefore, the prima facie findings recorded and directions issued, in the interim order has become final and absolute against the company and its directors other than Noticee no. 10 and 11. Therefore, the limited scope of the present proceedings is to determine the liability of Noticee no. 10 and 11, if any, for the violations, as alleged in the interim order.   8. In this regard, I note that as per interim order, the company had raised money through issue of SRNCDs, the details of which are as under: Page 7 of 9   Year No. of debenture certificates No. of allottees No. of debentures  Issue Value 2015-16 290 204 4,45,330 4,45,33,000 Total 290 204 4,45,330 4,45,33,000  9. I note that the company allotted SRNCDs to more than 200 persons in the year 2015-16. Therefore, in terms of Section 42 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 14(2) of the Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014 (Section 67 of the erstwhile Companies Act, 1956), I find that the said issue of SRNCD by the company was a deemed public issue.   10. As per interim order, the details of the present and past directors of the company are as under:   Sl.No. Name Designation  DIN Date of appointment Date of Cessation Details of Present Directors 1 Mr. Subash Chander Sharma  Director 03446903 February 05, 2016 - 2 Mr. Rajinder Singh  Director 03634397 February 19, 2015 - 3 Mr. Malkinder Singh Director 07407549 January 19, 2016 - Details of Past Directors 1 Mr. Mohammad Mukhtar Atif Director 05301406 June 15, 2012 May 03, 2013 2 Mr. Deepak Kumar Sah Director 03499812 June 15, 2012 September 20, 2012 3 Mr. Vidya Bhushan Ambastha Director 05303687 June 15, 2012 May 03, 2013 4 Mr. MD Sarfraz Ansari Managing Director 03486568 June 15, 2012 February 21, 2015 5 Mr. Vinod Yadav Director 06560333 May 03, 2013 February 19, 2015 6 Mr. Sanjay Paramanik Director 06560339 May 03, 2013 February 19, 2015 7 Mr. Kamal Kishor Sagar  Director 06560318 May 03, 2013 February 19, 2015 Page 8 of 9  8 Mr. Sachin Kumar Thakur Director 06560350 May 03, 2013 February 19, 2015 9 Mr. Pramod Kumar Managing Director 05137757 May 03, 2013 February 19, 2015 10 Mr. Rakesh Ranjan  Director 06448600 February 19, 2015 January 19, 2016 11 Mr. Harjinder Singh Director 03634395 February 19, 2015 February 05, 2016  11. After considering the submissions made by the Noticee no. 10 and 11 during the hearing and the material available on record, I find that SRNCDs were issued by the company during the financial year 2015-16 whereas Noticee no. 10 and 11 were the directors in the company from May 03, 2013 to February 19, 2015. Therefore, Noticee no. 10 and 11 were not the directors of the company when the company issued SRNCDs to the public in violation of the public issue norms. I also note that Noticees have submitted that they were merely the employees of the company and they are not aware of any fund raising by the company during their employment. Findings recorded in the interim order though expresses a possibility of issuance of SRNCDs by the company prior to coming into force of Companies Act, 2013 on the basis of an application form received, which was issued by the company under Companies Act, 1956, however, there is no further material to indicate that SRNCDs were actually issued under such application forms before financial year 2015-16. I find that the findings in the interim order pertained to fund raising by the company through the issue of SRNCDs during the financial year 2015-16 only, as mentioned in para 8 above. In view of this, I find that Noticee no. 10 and 11 are not liable for issue of SRNCDs by the company during the financial year 2015-16 when they were not directors in the company.   Directions:  12. In view of the above, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992, hereby dispose of the proceedings qua Shri Mr. Sanjay Pramanik Page 9 of 9  (Noticee no. 10) and Mr. Kamal Kishor Sagar (Noticee no. 11) initiated vide interim order dated May 22, 2019.  13.

TREASURY\\\\\\\\nWASHINGTON, D.C.\\\\\\\\nEnforcement Release: January 4, 2021\\\\\\\\nOFAC Enters Into $8,572,500 Settlement with Union de Banques Arabes et Fran\\\\\\\\xe7aises for\\\\\\\\nApparent Violations of Syria-Related Sanctions Program\\\\\\\\nUnion de Banques Arabes et Fran\\\\\\\\xe7aises (\\\\\\\\u201cUBAF\\\\\\\\u201d), a bank based in France that facilitates trade finance\\\\\\\\nbetween Europe and the Middle East, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia, has agreed to remit\\\\\\\\n$8,572,500 to settle its potential civil liability for 127 apparent violations of Syria-related sanctions (the\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u201cApparent Violations\\\\\\\\u201d).  Between August 2011 and April 2013, UBAF operated U.S. dollar (USD)\\\\\\\\naccounts on behalf of sanctioned Syrian financial institutions and indirectly conducted USD business on\\\\\\\\nbehalf of these institutions through the U.S. financial system.  In particular, the majority of the Apparent\\\\\\\\nViolations involved UBAF\\\\\\\\u2019s processing of internal transfers on behalf of Syrian entities that were\\\\\\\\nfollowed by corresponding funds transfers through a U.S. bank.  The remaining Apparent Violations\\\\\\\\nwere either \\\\\\\\u201cback-to-back\\\\\\\\u201d letter of credit transactions or other trade finance transactions involving\\\\\\\\nsanctioned parties, all of which were processed through a U.S. bank.  This settlement amount reflects\\\\\\\\nOFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s determination that UBAF\\\\\\\\u2019s Apparent Violations were non-egregious and voluntarily self-\\\\\\\\ndisclosed.\\\\\\\\nDescription of the Apparent Violations and the Conduct Leading to the Apparent Violations\\\\\\\\nIn total, UBAF engaged in 127 Apparent Violations.  This includes UBAF\\\\\\\\u2019s processing of 114 internal\\\\\\\\ntransfers on behalf of Syrian entities totaling $1,297,651,825.61 that were followed by approximately\\\\\\\\n114 corresponding funds transfers through a U.S. bank.  For 45 of the 114 internal transfers, UBAF\\\\\\\\nprocessed a USD transfer between two of its clients\\\\\\\\u2014one sanctioned Syrian entity and one non-\\\\\\\\nsanctioned client\\\\\\\\u2014on UBAF\\\\\\\\u2019s own books.  UBAF then processed one or more USD transfers on behalf\\\\\\\\nof the non-sanctioned client that cleared through a U.S. bank and whose transaction dates and amounts\\\\\\\\ncorrelated closely to the related internal transfers reflected on UBAF\\\\\\\\u2019s books.  For the remaining 69 of\\\\\\\\n114 internal transfers, UBAF conducted a foreign exchange (FX) transaction with a sanctioned Syrian\\\\\\\\ncustomer on UBAF\\\\\\\\u2019s books, debiting an account in one currency and crediting the same sanctioned\\\\\\\\ncustomer\\\\\\\\u2019s account in another currency.  UBAF then conducted a U.S.-cleared FX transaction with a\\\\\\\\nnon-sanctioned third party that correlated closely with the original FX transaction involving the\\\\\\\\nsanctioned customer.\\\\\\\\nThe remaining 13 Apparent Violations were either \\\\\\\\u201cback-to-back\\\\\\\\u201d letter of credit transactions or other\\\\\\\\ntrade finance transactions involving sanctioned Syrian parties, all of which were processed through a\\\\\\\\nU.S. bank.  For the back-to-back letter of credit transactions, a sanctioned Syrian entity was the\\\\\\\\nbeneficiary of export letters of credit or the applicant for import letters of credit that did not involve USD\\\\\\\\nclearing, but the intermediary entered into or received one or more corresponding USD letters of credit to\\\\\\\\npurchase or sell the same goods.  For the other trade finance transactions, UBAF either issued a USD-\\\\\\\\ndenominated letter of credit on behalf of a sanctioned party or confirmed a USD-denominated letter of\\\\\\\\ncredit issued by a sanctioned bank and paid on the letter of credit through a U.S.-cleared transaction.\\\\\\\\nAccordingly, between August 2011 and April 2013, UBAF processed 127 transactions, totaling\\\\\\\\n$2,079,339,943.52, in apparent violation of Executive Order 13582 of August 17, 2011, \\\\\\\\u201cBlocking\\\\\\\\nProperty of the Government of Syria and Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to Syria\\\\\\\\u201d (\\\\\\\\u201cE.O.\\\\\\\\n13582\\\\\\\\u201d), and Executive Order 13382 of July 1, 2005, \\\\\\\\u201cBlocking Property of Weapons of Mass\\\\\\\\nDestruction Proliferators and Their Supporters\\\\\\\\u201d (\\\\\\\\u201cE.O. 13382\\\\\\\\u201d).  UBAF\\\\\\\\u2019s actions during this time period\\\\\\\\ndemonstrated knowledge of OFAC sanctions laws, but it incorrectly believed that avoiding direct USD\\\\\\\\nclearing on behalf of sanctioned parties was sufficient; thus, the bank acted recklessly by failing to2\\\\\\\\nexercise a minimal degree of caution or care in accounting for the risks associated with continuing to\\\\\\\\nprovide USD-based services to OFAC-sanctioned parties.\\\\\\\\nPenalty Calculation and General Factors Analysis\\\\\\\\nThe statutory maximum civil monetary penalty applicable in this matter is $4,158,679,887.04.  OFAC\\\\\\\\ndetermined, however, that UBAF voluntarily self-disclosed the Apparent Violations and that the\\\\\\\\nApparent Violations constitute a non-egregious case.  Accordingly, under OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s Economic Sanctions\\\\\\\\nEnforcement Guidelines (\\\\\\\\u201cEnforcement Guidelines\\\\\\\\u201d), the base civil monetary penalty amount applicable\\\\\\\\nin this matter is $15,875,000.  The settlement amount of $8,527,500 reflects OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s consideration of the\\\\\\\\nGeneral Factors under the Enforcement Guidelines.\\\\\\\\nOFAC determined the following to be aggravating factors:\\\\\\\\n(1) UBAF demonstrated a reckless disregard for its U.S. sanctions compliance obligations when it\\\\\\\\ncontinued to provide USD services to sanctioned Syrian parties after the August 2011\\\\\\\\nexpansion of U.S. sanctions on Syria without properly identifying and managing the relevant\\\\\\\\nsanctions compliance risks that providing those services posed to the bank;\\\\\\\\n(2) UBAF management had actual knowledge of the conduct giving rise to the Apparent\\\\\\\\nViolations; and\\\\\\\\n(3) UBAF conferred significant economic benefit to U.S.-sanctioned parties and caused\\\\\\\\nsignificant harm to the integrity of U.S. sanctions programs and their associated policy\\\\\\\\nobjectives.\\\\\\\\nOFAC determined the following to be mitigating factors:\\\\\\\\n(1) The majority of the Apparent Violations occurred in late 2011, following the implementation\\\\\\\\nof Executive Order 13582 on August 18, 2011, which significantly expanded U.S. sanctions\\\\\\\\nagainst Syria;\\\\\\\\n(2) UBAF had a compliance program in place at the time of the apparent violations;\\\\\\\\n(3) UBAF voluntarily self-disclosed the Apparent Violations to OFAC and cooperated with\\\\\\\\nOFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s investigation of the Apparent Violations by entering into a tolling agreement and\\\\\\\\nagreeing to extend the agreement multiple times;\\\\\\\\n(4) UBAF has not received a penalty notice or Finding of Violation from OFAC in the five years\\\\\\\\npreceding the earliest date of the transactions giving rise to the Apparent Violations; and\\\\\\\\n(5) UBAF has represented to OFAC that it has invested substantial resources in improving its\\\\\\\\ncompliance program and undertook several remedial measures in response to the Apparent\\\\\\\\nViolations.  These measures include:3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 UBAF adopted a new Financial Security Charter on September 12, 2013, based on the\\\\\\\\ncompliance policies of its largest shareholder, a large and sophisticated financial\\\\\\\\ninstitution, at the invitation and with the support of the shareholder.  UBAF automatically\\\\\\\\nadopts all of this financial institution\\\\\\\\u2019s sanctions policies, and also utilizes its filtering\\\\\\\\nsoftware and supplemental lists to screen transactions.  This includes screening the client\\\\\\\\ndatabase, an anti-stripping module, negative news research, risk database research, vessel\\\\\\\\nscreening, and country screening.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 UBAF provides both in-person and e-learning training for all employees, both at\\\\\\\\nonboarding and on a continuing basis.  The e-learning program was developed with the\\\\\\\\nabove-mentioned financial institution and includes several yearly trainings.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 UBAF completed a review of its own business lines, which resulted in the termination of\\\\\\\\ncertain services that were deemed high compliance risks.  UBAF exited its relationships\\\\\\\\nwith certain high-risk banks, exited business with Sudan and Syria in all currencies, and\\\\\\\\nclosed a foreign subsidiary for risk-related reasons.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 UBAF set up a Compliance Committee, composed of senior managers, which meets\\\\\\\\nregularly to monitor follow-up on promised actions by member departments.\\\\\\\\nCompliance Considerations\\\\\\\\nFinancial institutions that maintain accounts for entities domiciled in jurisdictions that become subject to\\\\\\\\ncomprehensive sanctions should assess the risk that may arise by continuing to provide services to those\\\\\\\\nentities, particularly with respect to USD-denominated transactions that directly or indirectly clear\\\\\\\\nthrough the U.S. financial system.\\\\\\\\nOFAC Enforcement and Compliance Resources\\\\\\\\nFor more information regarding OFAC regulations, please visit: http://www.treasury.gov/ofac.\\\\\\\\nInformation concerning the civil penalties process is discussed in OFAC regulations governing the\\\\\\\\nvarious sanctions programs and in 31 C.F.R.

On examining the submissions made by the insurer vide \\\\\\\\nletter dated 22nd June, 2018, an SCN was issued on 2nd December, 2019.The \\\\\\\\ncompany replied to the SCN vide letter dated 24th December, 2019.

K. Mahipal Reddy, GM (NL) and Shri. A. Rama Sudheer, Manager \\\\\\\\n(NL) were present. \\\\\\\\n1.4 \\\\\\\\nThe submissions made by the insurer in its letter dated 24th December, 2019 and \\\\\\\\nduring the personal hearing on 12th November, 2020 have been carefully \\\\\\\\nconsidered by the Authority and on that basis the decision on each of the charges \\\\\\\\nis given as under: \\\\\\\\n2. \\\\\\\\nCharge no.1: \\\\\\\\n2.1 Violation of Guideline 5 (a) of MISPG- The MISP shall be sponsored by either \\\\\\\\ninsurer(s) or an insurance intermediary. \\\\\\\\nIt was observed that a few MISPs (sample of 15 dealers) were sponsored by both \\\\\\\\ninsurer and insurance intermediary. The insurer has enrolled MISPs based on \\\\\\\\ndocumentation and information provided by dealers without proper due diligence \\\\\\\\nand solicited business. \\\\\\\\n2.2 Summary of Insurer's submissions: \\\\\\\\n2.2.1The insurer submitted that MISPG came into effect from 1st November, 2017 and \\\\\\\\nthe dealers were trying to evaluate the pros and cons of direct MISP or through \\\\\\\\ninsurance intermediaries, which led to temporary ambiguity resulting in initial \\\\\\\\nchanges in sponsorship. The insurer further submitted that out of 15 cases \\\\\\\\nmentioned in SCN, in 9 instances the auto dealers were sponsored by both \\\\\\\\ninsurer and intermediary and the arrangements were later deactivated upon \\\\\\\\nreceipt of the information that they were sponsored by insurance intermediaries. \\\\\\\\nIn the remaining 6 cases, the MISPs have dealerships of different OEMs and \\\\\\\\nwere sponsored by the company as MISPs with respect to OEMs where the \\\\\\\\nMISPs had no sponsorship of either other insurer or insurance intermediaries. \\\\\\\\n2.2.2The insurer further submitted that it has put in place a robust process to ensure \\\\\\\\ndetailed due diligence of MISPs prior to sponsorship. The requisite data of MISPs \\\\\\\\nhas been validated on 11B portal prior to sponsorship to ensure that the Company \\\\\\\\nadheres to MISP Guidelines. \\\\\\\\n2.3 Decision on Charge no.1: \\\\\\\\nIn view of the insurer resolving the issue of common MISPs and confirming that \\\\\\\\na robust process has been put in place to ensure detailed due diligence of MISPs \\\\\\\\nprior to sponsorship, the insurer is advised to ensure that in future all the MISPs \\\\\\\\nare sponsored either by the insurer or an insurance intermediary but not by both. \\\\\\\\nPage 2 of 6\\\\\\\\n3. \\\\\\\\nCharge no.2: \\\\\\\\n3.1 \\\\\\\\nViolation of Guideline 5 (c) of MISPG by not issuing any appointment letters to \\\\\\\\nthe MISP sponsored by the insurer. \\\\\\\\nIt was observed that out of 172 direct MISPs, only 34 MISPs were issued \\\\\\\\nappointment letters. The insurer has not issued appointment letters to remaining \\\\\\\\nsponsoring MISPs. However, the said MISPs solicited Motor.Insurance business \\\\\\\\nduring this period. \\\\\\\\n3.2 Summary of Insurer's submissions: \\\\\\\\n3.2.1 The insurer submitted that the process of MISP documentation and signing up \\\\\\\\nwas time consuming and was required to be carried out with due diligence in \\\\\\\\nline with the MISPG and that the assessment of broker sponsored MISPs, \\\\\\\\nmultiple dealership and direct MISPs was in the process of being done. The \\\\\\\\ninsurer further stated that they released the payments to only those MISPs \\\\\\\\nwhere the process of execution of agreement and documentation was \\\\\\\\ncomplete. The insurer vide letter dated 24th December, 2019 has submitted that \\\\\\\\nthey have since issued appointment letters to all MISPs in compliance with the \\\\\\\\nMISPG. \\\\\\\\n3.3 \\\\\\\\nDecision on Charge no.2: \\\\\\\\n3.3.1 The MISP Guidelines came into effect from 1st November, 2017. The \\\\\\\\nappointment letters to insurer sponsored MISPs are required to be issued after \\\\\\\\ntraining and examination. As the insurer has taken necessary steps \\\\\\\\nsubsequently for the issuance of all required appointment letters to the \\\\\\\\nsponsored MISPs, the Insurer is hereby advised to ensure strict compliance of \\\\\\\\nGuideline 5 (c) of MISPG in future. \\\\\\\\n4. \\\\\\\\nCharge no.3: \\\\\\\\n4.1. \\\\\\\\nViolation of Guideline 15 (5) (d) of MISPG- The MISP or any of its associate \\\\\\\\ncompanies, shall not receive directly or indirectly from the insurer and the \\\\\\\\ninsurer shall not pay directly or indirectly to the MISP or any of its associate \\\\\\\\ncompany \\\\\\\\nany \\\\\\\\nfees, \\\\\\\\ncharges, \\\\\\\\ninfrastructure, \\\\\\\\nadvertising \\\\\\\\nexpenses, \\\\\\\\ndocumentation charges, legal fees, or any other payment by whatever name \\\\\\\\ncalled except as specified in MISP guidelines. \\\\\\\\nPayments were made to direct MISP and the designated person of MISP for the \\\\\\\\nfacilities used and under infrastructure and professional fees respectively. \\\\\\\\nPage 3 of 6\\\\\\\\n4.2. Summary of Insurer's submissions: \\\\\\\\n4.2.1 The insurer submitted that the payments made to parties mentioned in SCN \\\\\\\\ndated 2nd December, 2019 were payments that pertain to the services availed \\\\\\\\nby the company prior to October 31, 2017 whereas MISP Guidelines came into \\\\\\\\nforce on 1st November, 2017. The Agreements entered into with the identified \\\\\\\\nentity/ person were terminated with effect from 31 st October, 2017. The insurer \\\\\\\\nfurther submitted that the delay in processing of such payments was primarily \\\\\\\\non account of late receipt of the requisite invoice(s) from the vendor. The \\\\\\\\ninsurer submitted that the payments reflected in the said SCN were solely on \\\\\\\\naccount of services availed for the period upto October, 2017. The vendor had \\\\\\\\nsubmitted the corrected invoice and the same was enclosed with the response. \\\\\\\\n4.3. \\\\\\\\nDecision on Charge no.3: \\\\\\\\n4.3.1 The invoices and Payment Request Form (PRF) of the insurer in relation to two \\\\\\\\nparties {(one MISP- (one invoice) and one designated person of MISP - (two \\\\\\\\ninvoices)} confirm the payments towards utilization of infrastructure etc., for the \\\\\\\\nperiod upto November and December, 2017. The PRF is an internal document \\\\\\\\nof the insurer in which the payment as per the invoices raised by the entities \\\\\\\\nare processed for payment. The PRF document has three levels of checking \\\\\\\\nand verification by the officers of the insurer. Hence, submission of the insurer \\\\\\\\nthat the vendor had submitted the corrected invoice later cannot be accepted \\\\\\\\nas it is inconsistent with the available documents on record. \\\\\\\\n4.3.2 In view of the violations observed in the above cases of two parties in respect \\\\\\\\nof Guidelines 15 (5) (d) of MISPG, the Authority in exercise of the powers \\\\\\\\nvested under Section 102(b) of the Insurance Act, 1938 imposes a penalty of \\\\\\\\nRs. Five lakhs. \\\\\\\\n5. \\\\\\\\nCharge No. 4: \\\\\\\\n5.1 \\\\\\\\nViolation of Section 14 2 (h) of IRDA Act, 1999 read with Section 33 of \\\\\\\\nInsurance Act, 1938: As per 14 2 (h) of IRDA Act, 1999 read with Section 33 of \\\\\\\\nInsurance Act, 1938, the Insurer shall produce all such books of account, \\\\\\\\nregisters and other documents in its custody and furnish statements, \\\\\\\\ninformation within such time specified. \\\\\\\\nThe insurer has provided partial data, documents and information. \\\\\\\\nPage 4 of 6\\\\\\\\n5.2 \\\\\\\\nSummary of Insurer's submissions: \\\\\\\\n5.2.1 The insurer submitted that the company faced certain difficulties in submission \\\\\\\\nof the information as the department of finance and accounts and allied \\\\\\\\nfunctions embedded in IT structure were in the process of shifting from \\\\\\\\nBangalore to Mumbai. The relocation and coordination of the necessary \\\\\\\\nrecords was already going on it and caused a little delay in submission of \\\\\\\\ninformation. \\\\\\\\n5.3 Decision on Charge no.4: \\\\\\\\n5.3.1 The non-submission of the documents by the insurer for the purpose of \\\\\\\\nundertaking inspection is viewed seriously. However, taking note of the \\\\\\\\ninsurer's submission, the insurer is hereby directed to ensure prompt \\\\\\\\nsubmission of information/documents during the course of future inspections. \\\\\\\\n6. \\\\\\\\nSummary of Decisions: \\\\\\\\nCharge \\\\\\\\nViolation of Provisions \\\\\\\\nDecision \\\\\\\\nNo. \\\\\\\\n1 \\\\\\\\nGuideline 5 (a) of MISPG - Sponsorship \\\\\\\\n2 \\\\\\\\nGuideline 5 (c) of MISPG -Appointment letters \\\\\\\\nAdvisory \\\\\\\\n3 \\\\\\\\nGuideline 15 (5) (d) of MISPG - Indirect payments \\\\\\\\nRs. 5 Lakh \\\\\\\\npenalty \\\\\\\\n4 \\\\\\\\nSection 14 2 (h) of IRDAI Act 1999 read with Section 33 Direction \\\\\\\\nof Insurance Act, 1938- Non submission of information \\\\\\\\nThe penalty amount of Rs. 5 lakhs (Rupees five lakh only) shall be remitted by \\\\\\\\nthe Insurer by debiting the shareholders' account within a period of forty five days \\\\\\\\nfrom the date of receipt of this order through NEFT/RTGS (details for which will \\\\\\\\nbe communicated separately).

Out of the 14 PPG entities, 13 PPG entities traded in 1,52,05,631 shares of Spectacle (67.45% of the market volume) accounting for 89.28% of the total purchase group and 82.29% of the total sale of the group within PPG entities and 67.45% of the market volume from within the group entities.  f. It was observed that 15,63,314 shares accounting for 6.93% of the total market volume the buy and sale orders were placed in synchronised manner. The Noticee had bought 48,685 shares in a synchronised manner which accounts for 0.22% of the total market volume and contributed to creation of artificial volume.   g. It was observed that the PPG entities traded on 36 days and their contribution to daily market volume ranged from 91.87% on March 09, 2010 to 84.33% on April 30, 2010. Out of 36 trading days, the PPG entities traded among themselves on 27 trading days. PPG entities contributed more than 50% of the total market volume. It was also observed that by executing synchronised trades on 30 days among the group entities, PPG entities contribution to total market volume ranged from 13.97% on March 09, 2010 to 0.37% on April 29, 2010.    6. I find that the SCN dated August 5, 2019 which was issued to the Noticee had returned undelivered with remarks \\\\\\\\u2018not known\\\\\\\\u2019. Thereafter, during the course of the proceedings, the status of the Noticee was ascertained from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) website. It was observed that the name of the Noticee has been struck off from the list of companies by the Registrar of Companies, Mumbai (RoC)  as on July 26, 2017. As per the Notice of Striking Off and Dissolution list (Form No. STK-7), which was downloaded from the MCA website, a list of 11,820 companies were attached as per the Notification issued by ROC, Mumbai in terms of sub-section (5) of section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013 and rule 9 of the Companies ( Removal of Names of Companies from the Register of Companies) Rules, 2016. I find that the name of the Noticee was mentioned in the said list (at sl.no. 609 under CIN No U17110MH2005PTC153514). The Notification downloaded from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India, (www.mca.gov.in) website inter alia, mentioned the following: \\\\\\\\u201cThis is with respect to this Office\\\\\\\\u2019s Notice No. ROC/Section 248/Strike Off/2017 and notice in form STK 5 issued on dated 15.05.2017 and 18.05.2017 Notice isPage 7 of 8 In the matter of Spectacle Infotek Limited hereby published that pursuant to sub-section (5) of Section 248 of the companies Act, 2013 the names of the Companies as specified in Annexure \\\\\\\\u201ca\\\\\\\\u201d has this day of 26.07.2017 been struck off the register of companies and the said Company is dissolved.\\\\\\\\u201d  7. It is an established fact that when a company\\\\\\\\u2019s name is struck-off from the RoC list and the company is also dissolved, then it is a non-existing company and the adjudication proceedings against the non-existing company is thus nullity. In this context, I would like to draw reference to a judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) vs Vived Marketing Services (P) Ltd., ITA NO. 273/2009 dated September 17, 2009 in which it was held that - \\\\\\\\u201cWhen the Assessing Officer passed the order of assessment against the respondent company, it had already been dissolved and struck off the register of the Registrar of companies under Section 560 of the Companies Act. In these circumstances, the Tribunal rightly held that there could not have been any assessment order passed against the company which was not in existence as on that date in the eyes of law it had already been dissolved. We are of the opinion that the view taken by the Tribunal is perfectly valid and in accordance with law.\\\\\\\\u201d   8. Further, Black\\\\\\\\u2019s Law Dictionary explains \\\\\\\\u2018dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 as termination or winding up. It further clarifies that the dissolution of a corporation is the termination of its legal existence. Strike off essentially means removing the name of the company from the Register maintained by the Registrar of Companies. It is like closure of the company and the company will not be in existence after being struck- off and cannot perform any operations.  9. It is pertinent to note that, in the context of the alleged manipulation in the scrip of the company for the above referred investigation period, I note that in exercise of its powers conferred under sections 11(1), 11(4) & 11 B of the SEBI Act, an order dated February 2, 2011 against the Noticee has already been passed by SEBI restraining the Noticee from accessing the securities market. Vide the said order, the Noticee was also prohibited from buying, selling or dealing in securities in any manner whatsoever, till furtherPage 8 of 8 In the matter of Spectacle Infotek Limited directions. I note that the above direction was issued to the Noticee by SEBI prior to its name being struck-off from the RoC list. I am of the view that the role of the Noticee w.r.t its dealings in the scrip of the company during the investigation period has already been evaluated by SEBI and appropriate enforcement action has also been initiated against the Noticee in a separate quasi-judicial proceeding.  10.  Therefore, in view of the facts and circumstances noted in the preceding paragraphs and also the fact that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been struck-off from the RoC list and also \\\\\\\\u2018dissolved\\\\\\\\u2019 as on July 26, 2017 as per the RoC notification, I conclude that the present adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee vide SCN dated August 5, 2019 cannot be proceeded with.  ORDER  11. In view of the above observations/findings and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against the Noticee viz. Rajnandi Yarns Private Ltd.  12.

It was observed that the 18 entities, out of their total purchase and sale of 45992205 shares and 51740181 shares respectively during the investigation period, traded 39239127 shares (48.43% of the market volume) accounting for 85.32% of the total purchase group and 75.84% of the total sale of the group within PPG entities and 48.43% of the market volume from within the group entities.  h. It was observed from the Price volume data that the scrip was traded on  192 trading days.  Out of 192 trading days, the group entities traded among themselves on 159 days, i.e. 83% of the total no of days the scrip was traded during the period under investigation. It was observed that the PPG entities contribution to daily market volume ranged from 79.12% on May 03, 2010 to 1.06% on January 17, 2011. Out of 159 trading days the PPG entities traded among themselves, on 127 trading days PPG entities contributed more than 50% of the total market volume. The Noticee, being a part of the PPG entities have contributed significantly to the creation of artificial volume in the scrip and gave false and misleading appearance of trading in the scrip.  5. The Noticee replied to the SCN and subsequently adjudication order dated December 22, 2014 was also passed by the then Adjudicating Officer. As already mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, the Noticee challenged the AO Order before Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT and the same was set aside by SAT and restored the matter to the file of Adjudicating Officer.  6. During the course of the current proceedings, the status of the Noticee was ascertained from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) website. It was observed that the name of the Noticee has been struck off from the list of companies by the Registrar of Companies, Mumbai ( RoC)  as on July 26, 2017. As per the Notice of Striking Off and Dissolution list (Form No. STK-7), which was downloaded from the MCA website, a list of 11,820 companies  were attached as per the Notification issued by ROC, Mumbai in terms of sub-section (5) of section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013 and rule 9 of the Companies ( Removal of Names of Companies from the Register of Companies) Rules, 2016. I find that the name of the Noticee was mentioned in the said list (at sl.no. 609 under CIN No U17110MH2005PTC153514). The Notification downloaded fromIn the matter of Spectacle Infotek Limited Page 7 of 8  the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India, (www.mca.gov.in) website inter alia, mentioned the following: \\\\\\\\u201cThis is with respect to this Office\\\\\\\\u2019s Notice No. ROC/Section 248/Strike Off/2017 and notice in form STK 5 issued on dated 15.05.2017 and 18.05.2017 Notice is hereby published that pursuant to sub-section (5) of Section 248 of the companies Act, 2013 the names of the Companies as specified in Annexure \\\\\\\\u201ca\\\\\\\\u201d has this day of 26.07.2017 been struck off the register of companies and the said Company is dissolved.\\\\\\\\u201d  7. It is an established fact that when a company\\\\\\\\u2019s name is struck-off from the RoC list and the company is also dissolved, then it is a non-existing company and the adjudication proceedings against the non-existing company is thus nullity. In this context, I would like to draw reference to a judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) vs Vived Marketing Services (P) Ltd., ITA NO. 273/2009 dated September 17, 2009 in which it was held that - \\\\\\\\u201cWhen the Assessing Officer passed the order of assessment against the respondent company, it had already been dissolved and struck off the register of the Registrar of companies under Section 560 of the Companies Act. In these circumstances, the Tribunal rightly held that there could not have been any assessment order passed against the company which was not in existence as on that date in the eyes of law it had already been dissolved. We are of the opinion that the view taken by the Tribunal is perfectly valid and in accordance with law.\\\\\\\\u201d   8. Further, Black\\\\\\\\u2019s Law Dictionary explains \\\\\\\\u2018dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 as termination or winding up. It further clarifies that the dissolution of a corporation is the termination of its legal existence. Strike off essentially means removing the name of the company from the Register maintained by the Registrar of Companies. It is like closure of the company and the company will not be in existence after being struck- off and cannot perform any operations.   9. In the said matter, it is relevant to mention that the Noticee has already been debarred/restrained by SEBI vide Order dated February 2, 2011 from accessingIn the matter of Spectacle Infotek Limited Page 8 of 8  the securities market and also dealing in the securities market in any manner whatsoever, till further directions.  The above directions issued by SEBI is in the context of Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s trading/dealing in the scrip of the company for a different period i.e from May 29, 2009 to April 30, 2009. Therefore, I am of the view that the conduct of the Noticee while dealing in the shares of the company has already been evaluated by SEBI and appropriate enforcement action has also been initiated against the Noticee in a separate quasi-judicial proceeding.  10. Therefore, in view of the facts and circumstances noted in the preceding paragraphs and also the fact that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been struck-off from the RoC list and also \\\\\\\\u2018dissolved\\\\\\\\u2019 as on July 26, 2017 as per the RoC notification, I conclude that the present adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee cannot be proceeded with.  ORDER  11. In view of the above observations/findings and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against the Noticee viz. Rajnandi Yarns Private Ltd.  12. In terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, copies of this order are being sent to the Noticee, viz., Rajnandi Yarns Private Ltd and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

I find that the SCN dated August 5, 2019 which was issued to the Noticee had returned undelivered with remarks \\\\\\\\u2018not known\\\\\\\\u2019. Thereafter, during the course of the proceedings, the status of the Noticee was ascertained from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) website.

The Notification downloaded from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India, (www.mca.gov.in) website inter alia, mentioned the following: \\\\\\\\u201cThis is with respect to this Office\\\\\\\\u2019s Notice No. ROC/Section 248/Strike Off/2017 and notice in form STK 5 issued on dated 15.05.2017 and 18.05.2017 Notice isPage 7 of 8 In the matter of Spectacle Infotek Limited hereby published that pursuant to sub-section (5) of Section 248 of the companies Act, 2013 the names of the Companies as specified in Annexure \\\\\\\\u201ca\\\\\\\\u201d has this day of 26.07.2017 been struck off the register of companies and the said Company is dissolved.\\\\\\\\u201d  7. It is an established fact that when a company\\\\\\\\u2019s name is struck-off from the RoC list and the company is also dissolved, then it is a non-existing company and the adjudication proceedings against the non-existing company is thus nullity. In this context, I would like to draw reference to a judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) vs Vived Marketing Services (P) Ltd., ITA NO. 273/2009 dated September 17, 2009 in which it was held that - \\\\\\\\u201cWhen the Assessing Officer passed the order of assessment against the respondent company, it had already been dissolved and struck off the register of the Registrar of companies under Section 560 of the Companies Act. In these circumstances, the Tribunal rightly held that there could not have been any assessment order passed against the company which was not in existence as on that date in the eyes of law it had already been dissolved. We are of the opinion that the view taken by the Tribunal is perfectly valid and in accordance with law.\\\\\\\\u201d   8. Further, Black\\\\\\\\u2019s Law Dictionary explains \\\\\\\\u2018dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 as termination or winding up. It further clarifies that the dissolution of a corporation is the termination of its legal existence. Strike off essentially means removing the name of the company from the Register maintained by the Registrar of Companies. It is like closure of the company and the company will not be in existence after being struck- off and cannot perform any operations.  9. It is pertinent to note that, in the context of the alleged manipulation in the scrip of the company for the above referred investigation period, I note that in exercise of its powers conferred under sections 11(1), 11(4) & 11 B of the SEBI Act, an order dated February 2, 2011 against the Noticee has already been passed by SEBI restraining the Noticee from accessing the securities market. Vide the said order, the Noticee was also prohibited from buying, selling or dealing in securities in any manner whatsoever, till furtherPage 8 of 8 In the matter of Spectacle Infotek Limited directions. I note that the above direction was issued to the Noticee by SEBI prior to its name being struck-off from the RoC list. I am of the view that the role of the Noticee w.r.t its dealings in the scrip of the company during the investigation period has already been evaluated by SEBI and appropriate enforcement action has also been initiated against the Noticee in a separate quasi-judicial proceeding.  10.  Therefore, in view of the facts and circumstances noted in the preceding paragraphs and also the fact that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been struck-off from the RoC list and also \\\\\\\\u2018dissolved\\\\\\\\u2019 as on July 26, 2017 as per the RoC notification, I conclude that the present adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee vide SCN dated August 5, 2019 cannot be proceeded with.  ORDER  11. In view of the above observations/findings and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against the Noticee viz. Rajnandi Yarns Private Ltd.  12. In terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, copies of this order are being sent to the Noticee, viz., Rajnandi Yarns Private Ltd and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

The details of correspondences sent to company and its directors/promoters on the address as available on MCA portal are as follows:  Name of Entity/ Director/Promoter Designation Letter Dated Letter Status (Returned/ Delivered) Rakhal Bharoti Fish And Food Processing Limited Company September 25, 2020 Undelivered.

No updates after November 21, 2020 available at Indian Post website    6. Emails were also sent to the company at the email IDs available in company Master Data, Form 1 and Forms 32 on November 11, 2020, however, all the emails bounced back. Since the letters/emails sent to the company and its directors were either returned undelivered or no replies were received from the company, directors or promoters, a physical verification was conducted by SEBI on November 10, 2020 at the registered office address of the company available on record. The company was not found at its registered address. On local enquiries, no information could be gathered about the company. Vide communication dated November 11, 2020 information was sought from RoC regarding inter alia the details of total allottees to whom debentures have been issued by the company and the PAN details of the present/past, directors/promoters of the company. Further, the RoC was also inter alia informed that the company has not filed its Annual Accounts/Returns and that the company was not present at its registered office address as per MCA portal. RoC vide its letter received by SEBI on December 21, 2020 has given the certified copies of the documents which were downloaded by SEBI from MCA portal. However, details of the total allottees to whom SRD were issued by RBFFPL were not available.  7. In view of the aforesaid, examination by SEBI found that the Noticees no. 1 to 5 have prima facie violated provisions of Sections 56, 60, 62, 67, 73 and 117C of the Companies Act, 1956, and provisions of SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cILDS Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d),  Noticees no. 6 to 9 have prima facie violated provisions of Sections 62 of the Companies Act, 1956 and Noticee no. 10 has prima facie violated provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and SEBI (Debenture Trustees) Regulations, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cDT Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d), by making the public issue of SRD of RBFFPL.   8. Before proceeding further with the matter, it would be expedient to refer to the relevant provisions of the laws which the Noticees have prima facie been found toEx parte ad-interim Order cum Show Case Notice in the matter of Rakhal Bharoti Fish & Food Processing Ltd.

(3) No offer or invitation shall be treated as made to the public by virtue of sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), as the case may be, if the offer or invitation can properly be regarded, in all the circumstances \\\\\\\\u2013  (a) as not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation; or  (b) otherwise as being a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer or invitation:   Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall apply in a case where the offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or debentures is made to fifty persons or more:   Provided further that nothing contained in the first proviso shall apply to the non-banking financial companies or public financial institutions specified in section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956).  \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..  73.

(1A) Where a prospectus, whether issued generally or not, states that an application under sub-section (1) has been made for permission for the shares or debentures offered thereby to be dealt in one or more recognised stock exchanges, such prospectus shall state the name of the stock exchange or, as the case may be, each such stock exchange, and any allotment made on an application in pursuance of such prospectus shall, whenever made, be void, if the permission has not been granted by the stock exchange or each such stock exchange, as the case may be, before the expiry of ten weeks from the date of the closing of the subscription lists:   Provided that where an appeal against the decision of any recognised stock exchange refusing permission for the shares or debentures to be dealt in on that stock exchange has been preferred under section 22 of the Securities ContractsEx parte ad-interim Order cum Show Case Notice in the matter of Rakhal Bharoti Fish & Food Processing Ltd.

(3) All moneys received as aforesaid shall be kept in a separate bank account maintained with a Scheduled Bank until the permission has been granted, or where an appeal has been preferred against the refusal to grant such permission, until the disposal of the appeal, and the money standing in such separate account shall, where the permission has not been applied for as aforesaid or has not been granted, be repaid within the time and in the manner specified in sub- section (2); and if default is made in complying with this sub- section, the company, and every officer of the company who is in default, shall be punishable with fine which may extend to fifty thousand rupees. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  117C.

Page 13 of 22  10. The relevant provisions of the DT Regulations, 1993, as attracted in the matter, are as follows:  Relevant extract of provisions of DT Regulations, 1993:  Eligibility for being debenture trustee. 7. No person shall be entitled to act as a debenture trustee unless he is either\\\\\\\\u2014   (a)  a scheduled bank carrying on commercial activity; or   (b)  a public financial institution within the meaning of section 4A of the Companies        Act, 1956; or   (c)  an insurance company; or   (d)  body corporate.  11. I note that Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956 provides for situations when an offer or invitation is not considered as offer or invitation made to public even though it has been made to a section of public. As per the said sub section, if the offer is one which is not calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation, or, if the offer is the domestic concern of the persons making and receiving the offer, the same is not considered as public offer. Under such circumstances, in ordinary parlance, such offer or invitation is considered as private placement of shares or debentures. The scheme of Section 67(3) envisages the raising of funds by a company, privately, from informed and sophisticated investors or relatives/friends of promoters, who are capable of taking informed decisions on the basis of Letter of Offer or Information Memorandum issued by the company. The overarching intent of Section 67(3) is not to burden such private placements with regulatory supervision and compliances, since, the number of investors involved is restricted to 49 known / pre-identified persons and the public at large is not involved. However, first proviso to Section 67(3) restricts this private placement only to 49 persons and once, the offerree or invitees exceeds 49 persons, then such a private placement is also deemed as public issue. In such case, the regulatory supervision becomes more stringent and hence, the requirement in respect of contents of prospectus, filling of draft prospectus with Stock Exchanges, registration of prospectus with RoC, mandatory listing of securities on stock exchange etc. come into picture. In this regard, it would beEx parte ad-interim Order cum Show Case Notice in the matter of Rakhal Bharoti Fish & Food Processing Ltd.  Page 14 of 22  appropriate to refer to the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Sahara Real Estate Corporation and Others Vs. SEBI (2013) 1 SCC1, wherein while examining the scope of Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956, it was observed as follows:  \\\\\\\\u201c85. The first proviso to Section 67(3) was inserted by the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2000 w.e.f. 13.12.2000, which clearly indicates, nothing contained in Sub-section (3) of Section 67 shall apply in a case where the offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or debentures is made to fifty persons or more.  \\\\\\\\u2026.  86. Resultantly, after 13.12.2000, any offer of securities by a public company to fifty persons or more will be treated as a public issue under the Companies Act, even if it is of domestic concern or it is proved that the shares or debentures are not available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation.  \\\\\\\\u2026. 90. I may, therefore, indicate, subject to what has been stated above, in India that any share or debenture issue beyond forty nine persons, would be a public issue attracting all the relevant provisions of the SEBI Act, regulations framed thereunder, the Companies Act, pertaining to the public issue. \\\\\\\\u2026\"  12. Once an offer or invitation is a public offer, then the provisions relating to public issue such as prospectus, listing etc. including Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956 come into play and the company making such offer or invitation to public is required to make application for listing of shares or debentures offered to the public, to one or more recognized stock exchanges. Section 73 further provides that where the permission has not been applied or, such permission, having been applied for, has not been granted, the company shall forthwith repay without interest all moneys received from applicants in pursuance of the prospectus, and, if any such money is not repaid within eight days after the company becomes liable to repay it, the company and every director of the company who is an officer in default shall, on and from the expiry of the eighth day, becomes jointly and severally liable to repay that money with interest. A company making a public issue of shares or debentures is also required to comply with provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 and the regulations/guidelines made thereunder, in this regard.   13. I note that from the copies of SRD certificates submitted by the complainants, RBFFPL has issued SRD to 83 persons cumulatively amounting to Rs. 11,40,500/- during F.Y. 2012-13 and 2013-14, the details of which are as under:Ex parte ad-interim Order cum Show Case Notice in the matter of Rakhal Bharoti Fish & Food Processing Ltd.  Page 15 of 22   14. Therefore, such issue of SRD by RBFFPL to more than 49 persons would prima facie qualify as a public issue, as contemplated under proviso to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, 1956. In such a scenario, in terms of Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956, RBFFPL was required to make an application to one or more recognized stock exchanges for permission for the debentures intending to be so offered to be dealt with in the stock exchange or each such stock exchange. I note that in the present case there is no evidence on record to indicate that RBFFPL had made any application to recognized stock exchange(s) for listing of its SRD on such stock exchange and therefore, based on the material available on record, I find that RBFFPL has not prima facie complied with the provisions of Section 73(1) of Companies Act, 1956.    15.

It was observed that the 18 entities, out of their total purchase and sale of 45992205 shares and 51740181 shares respectively during the investigation period, traded 39239127 shares (48.43% of the market volume) accounting for 85.32% of the total purchase group and 75.84% of the total sale of the group within PPG entities and 48.43% of the market volume from within the group entities.  h. It was observed from the Price volume data that the scrip was traded on  192 trading days.  Out of 192 trading days, the group entities traded among themselves on 159 days, i.e. 83% of the total no of days the scrip was traded during the period under investigation. It was observed that the PPG entities contribution to daily market volume ranged from 79.12% on May 03, 2010 to 1.06% on January 17, 2011. Out of 159 trading days the PPG entities traded among themselves, on 127 trading days PPG entities contributed more than 50% of the total market volume. The Noticee, being a part of the PPG entities have contributed significantly to the creation of artificial volume in the scrip and gave false and misleading appearance of trading in the scrip.  5. The Noticee replied to the SCN and subsequently adjudication order dated December 22, 2014 was also passed by the then Adjudicating Officer. As already mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, the Noticee challenged the AO Order before Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT and the same was set aside by SAT and restored the matter to the file of Adjudicating Officer.  6. During the course of the current proceedings, the status of the Noticee was ascertained from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) website. It was observed that the name of the Noticee has been struck off from the list of companies by the Registrar of Companies, Mumbai ( RoC)  as on July 26, 2017. As per the Notice of Striking Off and Dissolution list (Form No. STK-7), which was downloaded from the MCA website, a list of 11,820 companies  were attached as per the Notification issued by ROC, Mumbai in terms of sub-section (5) of section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013 and rule 9 of the Companies ( Removal of Names of Companies from the Register of Companies) Rules, 2016. I find that the name of the Noticee was mentioned in the said list (at sl.no. 609 under CIN No U17110MH2005PTC153514). The Notification downloaded fromIn the matter of Spectacle Infotek Limited Page 7 of 8  the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India, (www.mca.gov.in) website inter alia, mentioned the following: \\\\\\\\u201cThis is with respect to this Office\\\\\\\\u2019s Notice No. ROC/Section 248/Strike Off/2017 and notice in form STK 5 issued on dated 15.05.2017 and 18.05.2017 Notice is hereby published that pursuant to sub-section (5) of Section 248 of the companies Act, 2013 the names of the Companies as specified in Annexure \\\\\\\\u201ca\\\\\\\\u201d has this day of 26.07.2017 been struck off the register of companies and the said Company is dissolved.\\\\\\\\u201d  7. It is an established fact that when a company\\\\\\\\u2019s name is struck-off from the RoC list and the company is also dissolved, then it is a non-existing company and the adjudication proceedings against the non-existing company is thus nullity. In this context, I would like to draw reference to a judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) vs Vived Marketing Services (P) Ltd., ITA NO. 273/2009 dated September 17, 2009 in which it was held that - \\\\\\\\u201cWhen the Assessing Officer passed the order of assessment against the respondent company, it had already been dissolved and struck off the register of the Registrar of companies under Section 560 of the Companies Act. In these circumstances, the Tribunal rightly held that there could not have been any assessment order passed against the company which was not in existence as on that date in the eyes of law it had already been dissolved. We are of the opinion that the view taken by the Tribunal is perfectly valid and in accordance with law.\\\\\\\\u201d   8. Further, Black\\\\\\\\u2019s Law Dictionary explains \\\\\\\\u2018dissolution\\\\\\\\u2019 as termination or winding up. It further clarifies that the dissolution of a corporation is the termination of its legal existence. Strike off essentially means removing the name of the company from the Register maintained by the Registrar of Companies. It is like closure of the company and the company will not be in existence after being struck- off and cannot perform any operations.   9. In the said matter, it is relevant to mention that the Noticee has already been debarred/restrained by SEBI vide Order dated February 2, 2011 from accessingIn the matter of Spectacle Infotek Limited Page 8 of 8  the securities market and also dealing in the securities market in any manner whatsoever, till further directions.  The above directions issued by SEBI is in the context of Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s trading/dealing in the scrip of the company for a different period i.e from May 29, 2009 to April 30, 2009. Therefore, I am of the view that the conduct of the Noticee while dealing in the shares of the company has already been evaluated by SEBI and appropriate enforcement action has also been initiated against the Noticee in a separate quasi-judicial proceeding.  10. Therefore, in view of the facts and circumstances noted in the preceding paragraphs and also the fact that the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s name has been struck-off from the RoC list and also \\\\\\\\u2018dissolved\\\\\\\\u2019 as on July 26, 2017 as per the RoC notification, I conclude that the present adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee cannot be proceeded with.  ORDER  11. In view of the above observations/findings and in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under section 15I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby dispose of the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against the Noticee viz. Rajnandi Yarns Private Ltd.  12. In terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, copies of this order are being sent to the Noticee, viz., Rajnandi Yarns Private Ltd and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

Securities and Exchange Board of India\\\\\\\\u2019s (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) alert system had generated front running alerts for the months of December, 2019 and__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 2 of 21  January, 2020 against Ms. Meena Ramniklal Vira, suspected to be front running the trades of Tata Absolute Return Fund, a scheme of Tata AIF, a SEBI registered Alternative Investment Fund (\\\\\\\\u201cBig Client / BC\\\\\\\\u201d).  2. Based on the aforesaid alert, SEBI conducted a preliminary examination for the period December 1, 2019 to April 15, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cExamination Period\\\\\\\\u201d) to look into the possible violations of provisions of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and various regulations framed thereunder including SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cPFUTP Regulations\\\\\\\\u201d) by certain connected entities including Ms. Meena Ramniklal Vira.  SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s Examination 3. SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s preliminary examination brought out the following: 3.1. It is observed that around 99% of trades of the Big Client in value terms were executed through their broker, Reliance Securities Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cRSL\\\\\\\\u201d). At RSL, the Big Client was placing orders through the following 3 Dealers namely, Mr. Harshal Ramnik Vira (Chief Dealer of RSL), Mr. Bhavesh Gandhi (Senior Dealer of RSL) and Mr. Abhijeet Nandkumar Jain (Deputy Dealer of RSL). 3.2. Certain entities connected with the aforesaid Dealers of RSL were prima facie observed to have traded depending on the impending orders of the Big Client on numerous occasions during different time periods during the Examination Period. Subsequently, these connected entities squared off their positions when the orders of the Big Client were placed in the market. Thus, they were able to generate substantial proceeds for themselves by placing orders in anticipation of the price movement of scrips on account of large buy / sell orders of the Big Client.__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 3 of 21  Interim Order 4. In light of the aforesaid findings of the examination, an interim order dated August 7, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cInterim Order\\\\\\\\u201d) was passed by SEBI inter alia against Bharat C Parekh - HUF, Mansi V Shah, Pravin Somani, Bimal N. Mehta, Jitendra M. Shah - HUF, Sanjay J Shah- HUF and Shimoni S. Shah (\\\\\\\\u201cNoticees\\\\\\\\u201d). The interim order against the Noticees was passed taking into account the facts and circumstances described therein, which are, inter alia, summarised as under: 4.1. Mr. Harshal Vira, Mr. Bhavesh Gandhi and Mr. Abhijeet Jain were privy to information with respect to the impending orders of the Big Client as they were the Dealers on behalf of the Big Client for its trades. Thus, they were in possession of information of the impending trades of the Big Client which was not available in the public domain. 4.2. Noticees are partners in the firm, Labdhi Enterprises (\\\\\\\\u201cfirm\\\\\\\\u201d). One of the partners of the firm, Ms. Falguni Ketan Parekh\\\\\\\\u2019s husband Mr. Ketan Parekh was in communication with Mr. Harshal Vira (3 calls; 1189 seconds) during the Examination Period.  4.3. The trading pattern of the trades executed from the trading account of the firm was analysed and it showed that the trades executed from the trading account of the firm has followed a Buy-Buy-Sell (\\\\\\\\u201cBBS\\\\\\\\u201d) pattern or Sell-Sell-Buy (\\\\\\\\u201cSSB\\\\\\\\u201d) pattern around the orders of the Big Client which, as noted from the order log trade log of the firm, was done consistently during the Examination Period.  4.4.  Based on the cumulative effect of various related facts like pre-examination period trading activity of the firm, its common scrip days / contract days with the Big Client and proceeds generated by the firm\\\\\\\\u2019s trades during the Examination period along with the trading pattern of the firm, it was prima facie concluded that the trades executed from the trading account of the firm in the equity derivative segment of the market had \\\\\\\\u2018front run\\\\\\\\u2019 the orders of the Big Client.__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 4 of 21  4.5.

Service of interim order, appeal, reply and hearing   6. The interim order was served on the Noticees vide email dated August 10, 2020. Pursuant to the interim order, the Noticees had filed an appeal (Appeal No. 486 of 2020; Date of decision: December 10, 2020) against the interim order before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (\\\\\\\\u201cSAT\\\\\\\\u201d). The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT without going into the merits of the case, disposed the appeal with the following directions: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026 the appellants to file their reply / objection on or before December 15, 2020. If such an objection is filed, the WTM will consider the objection and pass a reasoned and speaking order on or before December 31, 2020 after giving an opportunity of hearing to the appellants\\\\\\\\u201d.  7. Pursuant to the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT order, vide an email dated December 11, 2020, the Noticees were granted an opportunity of hearing on December 17, 2020 at 4 pm via video conference. In response to the hearing notice and in line with Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT direction, the Noticees vide their letter dated December 15, 2020 submitted a common reply and inter alia submitted as follows:__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 7 of 21  7.1. The Noticees are all merely sleeping partners and have no say in the day to day management of the firm. Ms. Falguni Ketan Parekh is the only working partner as per the partnership deed registered on March 15, 2010 and she is in charge of day to day management of the firm. The only allegation in the interim order is that the Noticees are partners of the firm and are therefore being charged with the prima facie observations made in the interim order. 7.2. Ms. Falguni Ketan Parekh is the only partner who draws a salary in the firm. She has opened an account with Canara Bank (Overseas Branch, BKC) bearing no. 1589101020913 and has deposited Rs 17.10 lakh. Thus, the interest of SEBI has been protected. 7.3. Section 25 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (\\\\\\\\u201cIPA\\\\\\\\u201d) is a general section applying to \\\\\\\\u201cliability\\\\\\\\u201d of a partner for the acts of the firm while Section 27 of the SEBI Act deals with the liability of a partner for violation of SEBI Act and the regulations made thereunder. The present case is squarely covered under specific provision of Section 27 (2) of SEBI Act and therefore, the applicability of Section 25 of IPA (which is the general law) is excluded in such cases. 7.4. In order to make a charge against a partner of a firm for the acts of the firm, Section 27 (2) puts the burden on SEBI to establish that the alleged acts are committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or any other officer of the company. 7.5. In the present case, it is not even alleged by SEBI that the Noticees were in charge of the firm for the conduct of the business of the firm. Further, the partnership deed and the income tax returns make it clear that the Noticees were not in-charge of the affairs of the firm and had no knowledge of the alleged offence being committed. 8. Noticees vide their common letter dated December 16, 2020 authorised Mr. Ravi Ramaiya, Mr. Kunal Katariya and Mr. Sahebrao Buktare (\\\\\\\\u201cARs\\\\\\\\u201d) to represent them__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 8 of 21  before SEBI in the extant matter. On the day of scheduled hearing, the ARs reiterated their submissions made in their reply and inter alia made the following submissions: 8.1. Noticees are in different line of business than the firm.  8.2. Once Section 27 (1) of SEBI Act is triggered, Section 27 (2) of SEBI Act cannot be invoked. In other words, if the Managing Partner of the firm is held liable, other partners of the firm cannot be held liable. 8.3. The ARs were advised to submit the following information on or before December 21, 2020: 8.3.1. Whether the Noticees were aware that the email id and phone no. given in the KYC form of LFC Securities Pvt. Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u201cLFC\\\\\\\\u201d) is that of Mr. Ketan Parekh? 8.3.2. What is the mechanism in the firm to get updates from the working partner? What are the ongoing controls in place on the working of Ms. Falguni Ketan Parekh? 8.3.3. What due diligence has been exercised by the Noticees vis-a-vis the working of the firm? 8.3.4. Who operates the bank account of the firm? The ARs were advised to submit the bank statement of the firm for the period, prior and post 6 months to the Examination Period. 8.3.5. Given the swing in profit figures of the firm over a period of time, the ARs were advised to demonstrate due diligence and control exercised by the Noticees.  8.3.6. What is the qualification of Ms. Falguni Ketan Parekh? The ARs were advised to demonstrate the due diligence exercised by the Noticees before they entered into a partnership with Ms. Falguni Ketan Parekh. 8.3.7. The ARs were advised to submit the demat statement of the firm for the period, prior and post 6 months to the Examination Period.__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 9 of 21  9. The AR vide his email dated December 22, 2020 while reiterating his submissions made at the time of hearing inter alia made the following submissions: 9.1. The email id and mobile no. of the firm as per the records is fparekh@hotmail.com and 9930036340 and the allegation in clauses 23.3.1.1 recording that Labdhi Enterprises and Mr. Ketan Parekh have same email id and mobile no. is incorrect. Likewise, the allegation in clause 23.3.1.2 recording that trade confirmations were being sent to email id and mobile no. of Mr. Ketan Parekh is also incorrect. Copies of sample emails and messages have been submitted by the Noticees. 9.2. It is SEBI\\\\\\\\u2019s own case that Mr. Ketan Parekh was the alleged information carrier. As partners of the firm, the Noticees had no knowledge of the same and therefore even if SEBI is able to establish the charge under sub-section (1), the proviso to sub-section (1) would negate such charge. 9.3. It is not even alleged in the interim order that the alleged offence was committed with the consent / connivance or attributable to any neglect of any partner. The same is not possible as the present partners being sleeping partners had no role or responsibilities in the firm and therefore the question of applicability of sub section (2) does not apply. 9.4. With respect to ongoing due diligence exercised by the partners, the Noticees have submitted that they meet annually to discuss the results of the firm. The working partner takes care of the day to day functioning of the firm and there is otherwise no meeting of the partners. 9.5. The firm had made a profit of Rs. 5,40,969 in the FY 2017-18 before partners\\\\\\\\u2019 remuneration, interest and share of profit, while it had made losses in the FYs 2018-19 and 2019-20 to the tune of Rs 11,05,012 and Rs. 16,85,715 respectively. Since returns on investments are inherently inconsistent in securities trading, there is no reason for the partners to expect consistency. Further, the amounts are all in few lakh and therefore are normal.__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 10 of 21  9.6. Ms. Falguni Parekh is a Diploma Holder in commercial arts and has more than 15 years of experience in financial markets. The dormant partners had invested small amounts looking at her experience. 9.7. The acquaintance with Mrs. Falguni Parekh, her experience in business and the small stakes involved in the investment, collectively were such that the Noticees could pose faith in her. Findings & Considerations 10. I have considered the allegations levelled against the Noticees in the interim order, oral submissions, their replies/written submissions and other material available on record. I note that in the instant case, the directions issued against the Noticees are interim in nature and have been issued on the basis of prima facie findings.  SEBI had issued directions vide interim order in the matter in order to protect the interests of investors and the securities market. Detailed investigation in the matter is still in progress. Thus, the issue to be considered at this stage is as follows: 10.1. Whether in light of the findings of the interim order, the facts and circumstances of the case and the submission of the Noticees in response to the interim order, the directions issued against the Noticees vide the interim order need to be confirmed, revoked or modified in any manner, during the pendency of investigation in the matter? I now proceed to consider the aforesaid issue in light of the specific contentions raised by the Noticees.  Issue - Whether in light of the findings of the interim order, the facts and circumstances of the case and the submission of the Noticees in response to the interim order, the directions issued against the Noticees vide the interim order need to be confirmed, revoked or modified in any manner, during the pendency of investigation in the matter? 11. Before, I proceed to deal with the Noticees replies/written and oral submissions, it will be relevant to note the following findings of the interim order with respect to the__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 11 of 21  trades executed from the trading account of the firm for which the Noticees have not made any submissions / disputed. The same are as follows: 11.1. The trades executed from the trading account of the firm have prima facie \\\\\\\\u2018front run\\\\\\\\u2019 the orders of the Big Client. 11.2. The role played by Ms. Falguni Ketan Parekh and Mr. Ketan Parekh in executing the prima facie front running trades from the trading account of the firm. 12. It is observed from the submissions made by the Noticees that they have disputed the findings of the interim order only on the following grounds: 12.1. They have no knowledge of the trades mentioned in the impugned order. 12.2. They are not in charge of the firm for the conduct of its business. 12.3. They had no access to non-public information of the Big Client. 13. In support of Noticees submission they have relied upon Section 27 (2) of SEBI Act and have contended that Section 25 of IPA is not applicable in the present case.  14. I note that the prima facie finding against the Noticees in the interim order is that they, being the partners of the firm, are prima facie responsible, jointly and severally for the acts of the firm. 15. Here, it will be appropriate to reproduce the text of Section 25 of IPA, Section 27 (2) of SEBI Act and regulations 3 (a), 3 (b), 3 (c), 3(d), 4(1) and 4(2)(q) of PFUTP Regulations. The same reads as follows: IPA Section 25  Liability of a partner for acts of the firm. Every partner is liable jointly with all the other partners and also severally, for all acts of the firm done while he is a partner  SEBI Act 27 (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), where an contravention under this Act has been committed by a company and it is proved that the contravention__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 12 of 21  has been committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company, such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to be guilty of the contravention and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. Explanation: For the purposes of this section, \\\\\\\\u2014   (a) \\\\\\\\u201ccompany\\\\\\\\u201d means any body corporate and includes a firm or other association of individuals; and    (b) \\\\\\\\u201cdirector\\\\\\\\u201d, in relation to a firm, means a partner in the firm PFUTP Regulations 3. Prohibition of certain dealings in securities No person shall directly or indirectly\\\\\\\\u2014 (a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner; (b)  use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed or  proposed  to  be  listed  in  a  recognized  stock  exchange,  any manipulative  or deceptive  device  or  contrivance  in  contravention  of  the  provisions  of  the  Act  or  the rules or the regulations made there under; (c)  employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange; (d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under. 4. Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 3, no person shall indulge in a manipulative, fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities markets__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 13 of 21  4 (2) Dealing in securities shall be deemed to be manipulative, fraudulent or an unfair trade practice if it involves any of the following: \\\\\\\\u2014 \\\\\\\\u2026 (q) any order in securities placed by a person, while directly or indirectly in possession of information that is not publically available, regarding a substantial impending   transaction in that securities, its underlying securities or its derivative; 16. One of the submissions of the Noticees is that they do not fall within the ambit of Section 25 of IPA as it is a general law. In this regard, I note that the IPA is not a general law. It is a specific law which deals with the rights, liabilities and duties of the partners vis-\\\\\\\\xe0-vis the firm as well as inter se among the partners. As noted from the preamble of the IPA, it is \\\\\\\\u201can act to define and amend the law relating to partnership\\\\\\\\u201d. Thus, in a proceeding against a partnership firm and its partners, the first recourse is under IPA as it explicitly lays the provisions governing the conduct of a partnership firm and its partners.  17. At this juncture, I would like to quote the observations of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Andhra Pradesh High Court in the matter of Gattamaneni Prameela and Ors. vs Avula Hymavathi and Anr. decided on June16, 1997. The Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court with respect to the legal liability of the partners, observed as follows: \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026it is true that under the Indian Partnership Act, \"firm\" or \"partnership\" is not a legal entity, but merely an association of persons agreed to carry on business. It is only a collective name for individuals carrying on business in partnership. The essential characteristic of a firm is, that each partner is a representative of other partner. Each of the partners is an agent as well as principal. He is an agent insofar as he can bind the other partners by his acts within the scope of the partnership agreement. He is principal to the extent that he is bound by the acts of other partners. In fact, every partner is liable for an \"act of the firm\". \"Act of a firm\" has been defined to mean \"any act or omission by__________________________________________________________________________________ Confirmatory Order in the matter of Front Running Trading activity of Dealers of Reliance Securities Ltd. and other connected entities                                                                                                                                       Page 14 of 21  all the partners or by any partner or agent of the firm which gives rise to a right enforceable by or against the firm.\" This is the civil liability of the firm and its partners.\\\\\\\\u201d 18. In light of the observations made by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court, it is noted that the firm as such has no legal recognition but is merely an association of individuals and a firm name is only a collective name of those individuals who constitute the firm. Therefore, for all the acts of the firm, every partner is liable, jointly with all the other partners, and also severally, while he is a partner. This principle is specifically laid down in Section 25 of IPA. Further, Section 25 of IPA does not make a distinction between a working partner and a sleeping partner. Here, it will be appropriate to refer to the observations of Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court of Kerala in the matter of Ameer and Ors. vs. B. Amoo and Brothers and Ors decided on October 15, 2019, wherein the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court observed as follows: \\\\\\\\u201cOne of the contentions raised in R.C.R. No. 228 of 2018 is that the person on whose behalf the bona fide need is set up, viz., Smt. Hajira, is a sleeping partner. This expression is not defined in the Partnership Act. In English law, the expression \"dormant partner\" is used interchangeably for \"sleeping partner\". Pullock and Mulla on the Indian Partnership Act (7th edition, page 49) makes the following observations: \"A sleeping partner is nevertheless a partner, even when he only 'sleeps'. Sometimes partners are absolutely inactive or deliberately choose to be inactive, for instance, is some cases where a partner is a government servant or person with similar status who is, by service rules, prohibited from engaging in any trade or business.\" \\\\\\\\u201d 19. In view of the aforesaid discussion, I note that for the act of the firm, the liability of the partner, irrespective of whether the partner is a working partner or a sleeping partner, arises from the basic premise that the law identifies the firm by the partners composing it and the principal \\\\\\\\u2013 agent relationship among the partners.

It is observed during inspection that the Noticee had selected a date on which client had debit balance or its retention amount was higher than credit balance and portrayed that date as date of settlement for that client. It was further observed that in case of clients for whom the Noticee had not been able to find such date, it had simply accepted that it has not settled such clients. In view of the above, it is alleged that the Noticee had tried to mislead inspection team by submitting wrong information that it had been continuously complying with said circular from April 2014 to Jun 2015. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 As per SEBI Circular No. SEBI/MIRSD/SE/CIR-19/2009 dated December 03, 2009, stockbrokers are required to send statement of Adjudication Order w.r.t. Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediaries Ltd.                                  6 | 28  accounts to clients while settling the account. Such \\\\\\\\u2018statement of accounts\\\\\\\\u2019 shall contain an extract from the client ledger for funds and an extract from the register of securities displaying all receipts/deliveries of funds/securities. The statement shall also explain the retention of funds/securities and the details of the pledge, if any. From the statements of accounts submitted by the Noticee vide its letter dated November 10, 2016, it was observed that copies of original statements were not sent to clients. It was observed that the Noticee had submitted statements taken from the system on the day of submission of aforementioned letter to SEBI. Further, the aforementioned statements contain only ledgers and do not explain retention of funds/securities. Additionally, it was observed that the Noticee had not sent running account settlement statement for quarter ended December 2014. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 From the information submitted by the Noticee, it was observed that statements were not sent as prescribed under SEBI Circular which states that actual settlement of funds and securities shall be done by broker at least once in month/quarter. The no. of instances wherein the statement of settlement sent to clients post 24 days are given below:  No. of days between date of settlement and date of dispatch proof of statement No. of instances 24-40 114 41-60 15 61-80 12 More than 80 16  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It was observed from above table that the aforesaid statements of settlement were sent to clients after more than 80 days from date of settlement in 16 instances. For client code 336115, statement of account was sent to client after 98 days from date of settlement during quarter Jul-Sep 2014. Adjudication Order w.r.t. Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediaries Ltd.                                  7 | 28  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It was observed that client code 51993 was not settled during quarter Apr-Jun 2014.  Further, it was observed that client codes 305312, 27017 and 21757 were not settled during quarters Jul-Sep 2014, Apr-Jun 2015 and Apr-Jun 2015 respectively.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It was also found that client code 12381 was not settled during quarters Jan-Mar 2015 and Apr-Jun 2015.  \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In view of the above, it is alleged that the Noticee had not submitted copies of original statements of accounts and that the statement of accounts submitted by the Noticee were not as per format prescribed by stock exchange and do not explain retention of funds/securities which is a key requirement of statement of running account settlement. Further, the dispatch proofs submitted by the Noticee show that statements were sent to settled clients after 24 to 98 days from date of settlement. It was also observed that statement of accounts does not pertain to running account settlement of clients. It was observed that the said communication had been sent to clients in regular course of business because of other requirements of sending statements. Therefore, it is alleged that the Noticee tried to mislead SEBI Inspection by wrongful portrayal of compliance with regulatory requirements. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In view of the above the Noticee is alleged to have violated the provisions of SEBI circular ref. no. MIRSD/SE/Cir-19/2009 dated December 3, 2009 and Clause A (2) of the Code of Conduct read with Regulation 9 (f) of the SEBI (Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992.  ii. Misuse of Client Funds \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In terms of SEBI circular ref. no. SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993, no money shall be drawn from client's account other than - money properly required for payment to or on behalf of clients or for or towards payment of a debt due to the Broker from clients or money drawn on client\\\\\\\\u2019s authority, or money in respect of which there is a liability of clients to the Broker, provided that Adjudication Order w.r.t. Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediaries Ltd.                                  8 | 28  money so drawn shall not in any case exceed the total of the money so held for the time being for such each client. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Data submitted by the Noticee was analysed and following was observed: a) In 45 out of 45 sample cases, the Noticee had misused client funds. Misuse of funds ranges from 43% to 70% of funds of credit balance clients. b) Minimum value of funds misused is Rs. 12,15,87,951.55 and maximum value of funds misused is Rs. 31,01,64,919.54 on sample days. c) Even if the full value of BG is taken into account while calculating B (in table at para 19 of SCN dated September 16, 2020), misuse of client funds is observed in all cases. d) A part of funds of credit balance clients has been used for purpose of debit balance clients and remaining part for own purposes of Noticee to the extent given in table at para 19 of SCN dated September 16, 2020. e) Analysis also entails that the Noticee had moved funds from client bank accounts to own accounts in excess of what was due to the Noticee. Thus there was non-segregation of client and own funds. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It was also observed that the Noticee had not segregated client and own funds as client funds were not available in client bank accounts and have been used for own purposes of the Noticee. Therefore, it is alleged that the Noticee has violated the provisions of SEBI Circular ref. no. SMD/SED/CIR/93/23321 dated November 18, 1993.  5. The Noticee, vide letter dated October 6, 2020 and email dated November 27, 2020 submitted its reply to the SCN. Submissions of the Noticee are summarised below: Adjudication Order w.r.t. Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediaries Ltd.                                  9 | 28  i. The Noticee has been in the business of stock broking for more than 35 years. ii. There is an inordinate delay of 5years in issuing SCN. Therefore, SCN must be withdrawn in this ground. iii. The allegation against the Noticee is two-fold. First, it is alleged that the Noticee has not complied with SEBI Circular No. SEBI/MIRSD/SE/CIR-19/2009 dated December 3, 2009 (hereinafter referred as \"1993 Circular\") and misled the investigating authority by providing wrong information. Second, it is alleged that the Noticee has misused client's funds. iv. With regards to the allegation that the Noticee has not complied with the 1993 Circular, the Noticee denies any non-compliance for the reasons mentioned below: \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Settlement of clients before March 2014 not done in accordance with the preference given by the clients in the running account consent: as per Noticee's interpretation of the NSE circular bearing Ref No. NSE/INSP/24849 dated October 29, 2013, pay-out of clients having credit balance upto Rs. 10,000/- was not required to be done at the relevant time and that the said amount could be retained towards depository charges and other charges Payable by the respective clients. However, upon clarification from the Exchanges, the Noticee is regularly settling the accounts of clients having credit balance of less than Rs. 10,000/-. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Credit balances of Inactive clients not settled for three years during the period June 2012 to March 2015: Clause 18 of the SEBI circular bearing Ref No. MIRSD/SE/CIR-19/2009 dated December 3, 2009 on \"Dealings between a client and a stock broker (trading members included)\" reads as follows: \\\\\\\\u201cThe stock broker shall frame the policy regarding treatment of inactive accounts, which should, inter alia, cover aspects of time period, return of client assets and procedure for reactivation of the same\\\\\\\\u201d \\\\\\\\uf0d8 In addition to the above, we referred to the NSE circular bearing Ref No. NSE/INSP/14048 dated February 3, 2010 and BSE notice Adjudication Order w.r.t. Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediaries Ltd.                                  10 | 28  number 20100203-30 dated February 3, 2010 which further clarifies the SEBI circular dated December 3, 2009. It is submitted that, as per both the Exchanges, while framing Policy regarding treatment of inactive accounts, trading member i.e. Noticee, shall define \" Inactive accounts\" while framing the policy. \\\\\\\\uf0d8 ACMIIL, has defined an active client as that client who has done at least one single trade during the inspection period (generally financial year). Moreover, even in all the inspection questionnaires sent by SEBI prior to inspection of our books of accounts for stock broking operations, an active client is any client who has traded even at least once during a financial year. As such, we have treated any client who has not traded for a period of l year as an inactive client. \\\\\\\\uf0d8 NSE vide its circular reference number NSE/INSP/24849 dated October 29,2013 has specified that, to address the administrative/ operational difficulties in settling the accounts of regular trading clients, the member may retain an amount of upto Rs. 10,000/(net amount across segment and across exchanges). This circular was issued considering the inconvenience faced by both, the clients and the brokers in processing such small amount. Hence, the Noticee was under a bona fide impression that the Exchange has allowed the stock broker to hold Maximum amount of Rs.-10000/-, even in case of inactive clients. \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Consequently, the Noticee, in the case of inactive clients, having credit balance of upto Rs. 10,000/-, retained the said amount and for clients having credit balance more than Rs. 10,000/- have settled the same in subsequent quarters. \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Moreover, it was submitted that, out of all the clients, we have 20% clients from Tire l, 29% clients in Tier II cities and the rest 51% are in remote locations. Many of the clients in remote locations do not have net banking facility or the bank connectivity for core banking system is not yet strong and hence these clients requested to release Adjudication Order w.r.t. Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediaries Ltd.                                  11 | 28  pay-out only on their request. Even after our repeated requests, at the relevant time (i.e. the period under inspection), due to lack of sufficient documentary evidence, proper Bank details could not be updated for these Clients. Hence, during the inspection period, we were unable to Process the pay-out of such dormant clients. \\\\\\\\uf0d8 It is submitted that, the same applies for the 1311 clients whose accounts were allegedly not settled during the period Jun 12-Jun 15. We further humbly submit that all these clients had a balance of less than Rs. 10,000/- in our ledger accounts and as per our understanding of the circular regarding settlement of funds and securities, these were not required to be settled. \\\\\\\\uf0d8 Lastly, we submitted that, in any event, the total amount pertaining to these clients is only Rs.10,30,599 /- with a minimum credit balance of Rs. 100/- and a maximum credit balance of Rs. 1,34,088.50. Therefore, this amount of Rs. 10,30,599/- is extremely miniscule considering the size of our operations. However, the same has been settled in subsequent quarter \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Settlement of 9 active clients not done: 5 out of nine clients were settled in the subsequent quarter. Other 3 clients had a ledger balance of less than Rs. 10,000/- and thus, were not required to be settled. Remaining one client was settled well within time, was settled well within time, on 20-05-2014 during the quarter Apr-Jun 20-14 \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Historical Calculation Sheets explaining the retention and date of settlement are not maintained: Maintaining of the historical calculation sheets explaining the settlement obligation /retention and date of settlement were not mandated by any rules or regulations. We submit that the dates provided by us are the dates on which the respective client's accounts were settled as per client's preference. The software that was being used at that time did not have provision for retrieving this kind of historical data. It was submitted that we have now procured third party software named 'Comtek' hence; the historical calculations of settlement can be retrieved from the said Adjudication Order w.r.t. Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediaries Ltd.                                  12 | 28  software for the period post October 2018. Therefore, we deny the allegation that we have tried to mislead the inspection team by providing wrong information. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Statement of Settlement was not sent within 24 hours from the date of settlement: We submit that the retention of original hard copies of statement of settlement sent to the clients is not mandatory. Moreover, it was also submitted that we have provided a copy of the statement of settlement of accounts which was sent to the client. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 Statement was issued even though the client's account was not settled: As a matter of abundant caution and good corporate governance, the Noticee sent the statement to the clients whose accounts are not settled. It instils a confidence in its clients that they are aware of the status of their accounts on real time basis. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In light of what is stated above, the Noticee submits that it is in compliance with the 1993 circular. Moreover, the Noticee denies that it has misled the inspection team by wrongful portrayal of compliance with regulatory provisions. v. With regard to the allegation of misuse of clients funds, Adjudicating Authority had placed reliance on a tabular form in the Show Cause Notice and alleged that funds of credit balance clients were mis-utilised to meet the obligations of debit balance clients and/for own purpose thus, violating the provisions of the 1993 Circular. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 At the outset, it was submitted that this Table is prepared as per the Clause 3 of Annexure of SEBI Circular SEBI /HO /MIRSD /MIRSD2 /CIR/P/2019/95 dated September 26, 2016 (hereinafter referred as \"Enhanced Supervision Circular\"). This enhanced supervision circular was not in existence during the period of inspection i.e. from April 1, 2012 to March 31., 2015. It has come into effect only on July 1, 2017 and therefore, it is submitted that it was incorrect to place reliance upon a circular which was not in existence at the relevant point of time \\\\\\\\uf0b7 this calculation fails to take into account the hold shares i.e. shares in Client Unpaid Securities Account (\"CUSA\"). It was submitted that these Adjudication Order w.r.t. Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediaries Ltd.                                  13 | 28  liquid securities were bought by the ACMIL on behalf of its clients and were at its disposal to recover outstanding from clients. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In addition to this, it was submitted that, at the relevant point of time the Noticee had an overdraft facility of Rs. 9 crores with State Bank of India. It continues to have an overdraft facility in our account with State Bank of India, Capital Market Branch against property collateral for the past three decades. In any event of non-receipt of funds from any of the clients for shares purchased by them, the Noticee uses its overdraft facility for making up the shortfall for pay- in. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 It was also indicated that the unfunded portion of the Bank Guarantee (\"BG\") and the unutilized portion of the Overdraft (OD) facility must be accounted for, while arriving at funds available to pay off the creditors especially pre 2016 circular period. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 If CUSA (shares held due to non-Payment), the unfunded portion of the BG and the unutilized portion of the OD are taken into account, there is no shortfall on most of the dates, even as Per the Enhanced Supervision Circular, though this circular was not in existence at that time. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 In order to further corroborate the abovementioned submissions, the Noticee, has recast the table given in the SCN. It is submitted that, this table clearly demonstrates that, if the CUSA Shares and the unutilised portion of the overdraft facility are considered, then the Noticee had adequate liquidity to pay off our credit balance clients. Thus, it is submitted that the Noticee has neither used the funds of credit balance clients for debit balance clients nor has it used the funds of credit balance clients for our own purposes. \\\\\\\\uf0b7 With regard to, non-segregation of client's and own funds and client funds are not available in client bank accounts and are used for own purposes, it is submitted that the money paid by clients for transactions entered into by them include the brokerage charges and statutory levies payable on account of the transactions done by the client. Hence, the amount equivalent to such charges and statutory levies is transferred Adjudication Order w.r.t. Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediaries Ltd.                                  14 | 28  to Noticee's own account from client bank account. Thus, it is submitted that the Noticee is segregating client and own funds. vi. In view of the above, it is humbly prayed that the proceedings against the Noticee may kindly be dropped and the Noticee must be exonerated of all charges.  6. In the interest of natural justice and in order to conduct an inquiry in terms of Rule 4 (3) of the Adjudication Rules, vide hearing Notice dated October 13, 2020 the Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing on October 28, 2020 through video conferencing on the Webex platform.

During hearing, the authorised representatives of the Noticee had desired to submit additional submissions in the matter which was subsequently made vide email dated November 27, 2020.   7. Taking into account the aforesaid facts, I am of the view that principles of natural justice have been followed in the matter by granting the Noticee opportunities of being heard and submit its reply. Therefore, I deem it appropriate to decide the matter on the basis of facts/material available on record including the replies of the Noticee.  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES, EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS  8.

Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediaries Ltd.                                  15 | 28   After perusal of the material available on record, I have the following issues for consideration, viz. I.

(\\\\\\\\u201cBitGo\\\\\\\\u201d), a technology company based in Palo Alto, California, that implements security\\\\\\\\nand scalability platforms for digital assets and offers non-custodial secure digital wallet management\\\\\\\\nservices, has agreed to remit $98,830 to settle its potential civil liability for 183 apparent violations of\\\\\\\\nmultiple sanctions programs (the \\\\\\\\u201cApparent Violations\\\\\\\\u201d).  As a result of deficiencies related to BitGo\\\\\\\\u2019s\\\\\\\\nsanctions compliance procedures, BitGo failed to prevent persons apparently located in the Crimea\\\\\\\\nregion of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria from using its non-custodial secure digital wallet\\\\\\\\nmanagement service.  BitGo had reason to know that these users were located in sanctioned jurisdictions\\\\\\\\nbased on Internet Protocol (IP) address data associated with devices used to log in to the BitGo platform.\\\\\\\\nAt the time of the transactions, however, BitGo failed to implement controls designed to prevent such\\\\\\\\nusers from accessing its services.  OFAC determined that BitGo did not voluntarily self-disclose the\\\\\\\\nApparent Violations and that the Apparent Violations constitute a non-egregious case.\\\\\\\\nThis action emphasizes that OFAC sanctions compliance obligations apply to all U.S. persons, including\\\\\\\\nthose involved in providing digital currency services.

The Apparent Violations related to BitGo\\\\\\\\u2019s \\\\\\\\u201chot wallet\\\\\\\\u201d secure digital wallet\\\\\\\\nmanagement service.1  Individuals located in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria signed up for \\\\\\\\u201chot\\\\\\\\nwallet\\\\\\\\u201d accounts and accessed BitGo\\\\\\\\u2019s online platform to conduct digital currency transactions.\\\\\\\\nAt the time of the Apparent Violations, BitGo tracked its users\\\\\\\\u2019 IP addresses for security purposes related\\\\\\\\nto account logins.  BitGo, however, did not use this IP address information for sanctions compliance\\\\\\\\npurposes.  As a result, users located in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria were able to create and use\\\\\\\\ndigital currency wallets on BitGo\\\\\\\\u2019s platform and engage in digital currency transactions, despite BitGo\\\\\\\\u2019s\\\\\\\\nability to identify the location of these users.\\\\\\\\nPrior to April 2018, BitGo allowed individual users of its secure wallet management services to open an\\\\\\\\naccount by providing only a name and email address.  In April 2018, BitGo amended its practices to\\\\\\\\nrequire all new accountholders to also verify the country in which they are located, but BitGo generally\\\\\\\\nrelied on each user\\\\\\\\u2019s attestation regarding their location and did not perform additional verification or\\\\\\\\ndiligence on the location of its users.  However, after learning of the Apparent Violations, in January\\\\\\\\n2020, BitGo implemented an OFAC Sanctions Compliance Policy (\\\\\\\\u201cOFAC Policy\\\\\\\\u201d) and undertook\\\\\\\\nsignificant remedial measures, as further described below.\\\\\\\\nBy failing to prevent users located in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria to access and use its services\\\\\\\\nto engage in digital currency transactions, BitGo apparently violated Executive Order 13685 of\\\\\\\\n1 BitGo\\\\\\\\u2019s \\\\\\\\u201chot wallet\\\\\\\\u201d service is a non-custodial service to an online wallet that stores keys online and can be used to send\\\\\\\\ndigital currency to other wallets via a public blockchain.  The Apparent Violations relate to \\\\\\\\u201chot wallet\\\\\\\\u201d services provided by\\\\\\\\nBitGo, Inc. and do not relate to enterprise or custodial services provided by BitGo Inc.\\\\\\\\u2019s affiliate, BitGo Trust Company, Inc.2\\\\\\\\nDecember 19, 2014, \\\\\\\\u201cBlocking Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting Certain Transactions with\\\\\\\\nRespect to the Crimea Region of Ukraine\\\\\\\\u201d, the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. \\\\\\\\xa7515.201;\\\\\\\\nthe Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. \\\\\\\\xa7560.204; the Sudanese Sanctions\\\\\\\\nRegulations, 31 C.F.R. \\\\\\\\xa7538.205 (SSR)2; and the Syrian Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. \\\\\\\\xa7542.207.\\\\\\\\nPenalty Calculation and General Factors Analysis\\\\\\\\nThe statutory maximum civil monetary penalty applicable in this matter is $53,051,675.  OFAC\\\\\\\\ndetermined that BitGo did not voluntarily self-disclose the Apparent Violations and that the Apparent\\\\\\\\nViolations constitute a non-egregious case.  Accordingly, under OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s Economic Sanctions\\\\\\\\nEnforcement Guidelines (\\\\\\\\u201cEnforcement Guidelines\\\\\\\\u201d), the base civil monetary penalty amount applicable\\\\\\\\nin this matter is $183,000.  The settlement amount of $93,830 reflects OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s consideration of the\\\\\\\\nGeneral Factors under the Enforcement Guidelines.\\\\\\\\nOFAC determined the following to be aggravating factors:\\\\\\\\n(1) BitGo failed to exercise due caution or care for its sanctions compliance obligations when it failed\\\\\\\\nto prevent persons apparently located in sanctioned jurisdictions to open accounts and send digital\\\\\\\\ncurrencies via its platform as a result of a failure to implement appropriate, risk-based sanctions\\\\\\\\ncompliance controls; and\\\\\\\\n(2) BitGo had reason to know that some of its users were located in sanctioned jurisdictions based on\\\\\\\\nthose users\\\\\\\\u2019 IP address data, which it had separately obtained for security purposes.\\\\\\\\nOFAC determined the following to be mitigating factors:\\\\\\\\n(1) BitGo is a relatively small company and has not received a penalty notice or Finding of Violation\\\\\\\\nfrom OFAC in the five years preceding the date of the earliest transaction giving rise to the\\\\\\\\napparent violations;\\\\\\\\n(2) BitGo cooperated with OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s investigation into these apparent violations; and\\\\\\\\n(3) BitGo represented that it has invested in significant remedial measures in response to the\\\\\\\\nApparent Violations and as part of its agreement with OFAC to implement compliance\\\\\\\\ncommitments intended to minimize the risk of recurrence of similar conduct in the future,\\\\\\\\nincluding:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 BitGo hired a Chief Compliance Officer and implemented its new OFAC Policy, which now\\\\\\\\napplies to all BitGo\\\\\\\\u2019s services;\\\\\\\\n2 Effective October 12, 2017, pursuant to Executive Order 13761 (as amended by Executive Order 13804), U.S. persons are no\\\\\\\\nlonger prohibited from engaging in transactions that were previously prohibited solely under the SSR.  Consistent with the\\\\\\\\nrevocation of these sanctions, OFAC removed the SSR from the Code of Federal Regulations on June 29, 2018.  However, the\\\\\\\\nrevocation of these sanctions does not affect past, present, or future OFAC enforcement investigations or actions related to any\\\\\\\\napparent violations of the SSR arising from activities that occurred prior to October 12, 2017.3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 BitGo implemented a new OFAC Policy that includes:\\\\\\\\no A detailed overview of OFAC and relevant sanctions laws;\\\\\\\\no The appointment of a compliance officer specifically responsible for implementing and\\\\\\\\nproviding guidance and interpretation on matters related to U.S. sanctions laws;\\\\\\\\no IP address blocking, as well as email-related restrictions, for sanctioned jurisdictions;\\\\\\\\no Periodic batch screening;\\\\\\\\no Recordkeeping procedures for all financial records and documentation related to\\\\\\\\nsanctions compliance efforts;\\\\\\\\no A review and, where appropriate, update of end-user agreements to ensure that customers\\\\\\\\nare aware of, and comply with, U.S. sanctions requirements; and\\\\\\\\no A review of screening configuration criteria on a periodic basis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 BitGo screens all accounts, including \\\\\\\\u201chot wallet\\\\\\\\u201d accounts, against OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s Specially\\\\\\\\nDesignated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, including blocked cryptocurrency wallet\\\\\\\\naddresses identified by OFAC.  BitGo has also conducted a retroactive batch screen of all\\\\\\\\nusers;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 BitGo routinely reviews its OFAC Policy and updates its procedures, as appropriate; and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2022 BitGo employees are required to certify that they have reviewed and understand BitGo\\\\\\\\u2019s\\\\\\\\nOFAC Policy, and are required to attend training programs, as appropriate.\\\\\\\\nCompliance Considerations\\\\\\\\nThis action highlights that companies involved in providing digital currency services\\\\\\\\u2014like all financial\\\\\\\\nservice providers\\\\\\\\u2014should understand the sanctions risks associated with providing digital currency\\\\\\\\nservices and should take steps necessary to mitigate those risks.  Companies that facilitate or engage in\\\\\\\\nonline commerce or process transactions using digital currency are responsible for ensuring that they do\\\\\\\\nnot engage in transactions prohibited by OFAC sanctions, such as dealings with blocked persons or\\\\\\\\nproperty, or engaging in prohibited trade or investment-related transactions.\\\\\\\\nTo mitigate such risks, administrators, exchangers, and users of digital currencies should develop a\\\\\\\\ntailored, risk-based sanctions compliance program.  OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s A Framework for OFAC Compliance\\\\\\\\nCommitments notes that each risk-based sanctions compliance program will vary depending on a variety\\\\\\\\nof factors, including the company\\\\\\\\u2019s size and sophistication, products and services, customers and\\\\\\\\ncounterparties, and geographic locations, but should be predicated on and incorporate at least five\\\\\\\\nessential components of compliance: (1) management commitment; (2) risk assessment; (3) internal\\\\\\\\ncontrols; (4) testing and auditing; and (5) training.  Within that framework, this enforcement action\\\\\\\\nemphasizes the importance of implementing technical controls, such as sanctions list screening and IP\\\\\\\\nblocking mechanisms, to mitigate sanctions risks in connection with digital currency services.4\\\\\\\\nAdditional guidance from OFAC related to the provision of digital currency services can be found here:\\\\\\\\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/topic/1626.\\\\\\\\nOFAC Enforcement and Compliance Resources\\\\\\\\nOn May 2, 2019, OFAC published A Framework for OFAC Compliance Commitments in order to\\\\\\\\nprovide organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction, as well as foreign entities that conduct business in or\\\\\\\\nwith the United States or U.S. persons, or that use U.S.-origin goods or services, with OFAC\\\\\\\\u2019s\\\\\\\\nperspective on the essential components of a sanctions compliance program.  The Framework also\\\\\\\\noutlines how OFAC may incorporate these components into its evaluation of apparent violations and\\\\\\\\nresolution of investigations resulting in settlements.  The Framework includes an appendix that offers a\\\\\\\\nbrief analysis of some of the root causes of apparent violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions\\\\\\\\nprograms OFAC has identified during its investigative process.\\\\\\\\nInformation concerning the civil penalties process is discussed in OFAC regulations governing the\\\\\\\\nvarious sanctions programs and in 31 C.F.R. Part 501.  On November 9, 2009, OFAC published as\\\\\\\\nAppendix A to Part 501 the Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines.  See 74 Fed. Reg. 57,593\\\\\\\\n(Nov. 9, 2009).

In light of the aforesaid discussions, I prima facie observe, from the contents of websites of Good Profit wherein various services offered by Good Profit have been described, that it is prima facie holding itself out as an investment adviser. Further, it is prima facie observed from the website of the firm gpsa.in that \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI REG NO-Coming Soon\\\\\\\\u201d. Moreover, it is noted from the website gpsa.in that Good Profit offered various tips / services to its clients in the securities market through emails, SMSs and Messenger (Hangouts).  From the narrative of the transactions in the Bank accounts, it appears that the payments have, prima facie, come from various investors / clients. Considering the above facts and circumstances, including the admission of Ms. Jansirani, the content of the website(s) of Good Profit coupled with the credit transactions in the bank accounts and through the payment gateway, prima facie, it is inferred that the fees / funds credited to the bank accounts and by payment gateway, were for the purpose of availing the services indicated on the website(s) of Good Profit.  9. As regards the fees collected by Good Profit, the e-mail dated July 09, 2019 from Jansirani avers that the firm offered investment advice to 159 clients since 2017 and collected Rs. 8.25 Lacs from them. However, from the perusal of the information gathered from the payment gateway Easebuzz, it is observed that the firm collected Rs. 12.73 Lacs through Good Profit website and Rs.1.01 Lacs through gpsa.in website which is much more than as claimed in the e-mail dated July 09, 2019. Further, no information was submitted by the firm with respect to the amounts collected through the two bank accounts mentioned on the website(s) of the firm i.e. Canara bank and Tamilnadu Mercantile Bank.  Further, no information regarding other sources of income has been furnished by the firm. In view of__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Good Profit Advisory Company and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani Page 9 of 18 the same, it is prima facie observed that Ms. Jansirani has not furnished the complete information as to the fees collected from clients. Therefore, the total amounts credited to the Bank Accounts since 2017 i.e. the year from which the firm has admittedly offered investment advice are considered as fees collected from its clients.    9.1 In this factual context, I have perused the definition of Investment Adviser as given in Regulation 2(m) of the IA Regulations, which states that Investment Adviser means \\\\\\\\u201cany person, who for consideration, is engaged in the business of providing investment advice to clients or other persons or group of persons and includes any person who holds out himself as an investment adviser, by whatever name called\\\\\\\\u201d. Further, I have perused Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations which defines Investment Advice as \\\\\\\\u201cadvice relating to investing in, purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in securities or investment products, and advice on investment portfolio containing securities or investment products, whether written, oral or through any other means of communication for the benefit of the client and shall include financial planning.\\\\\\\\u201d   9.2 In light of the aforesaid definitions, it is observed from the contents of the website(s) of the firm that it is holding itself out as an investment adviser by prima facie offering to provide investment advice as defined under regulation 2(l) of IA Regulations by offering to give advice related to investing in, purchasing and selling in securities and is also offering various investment packages for subscription. Further, as noted from the bank accounts there are multiple credit entries which when seen together with the contents of the website(s) lead to a prima facie conclusion that the credit entries in the bank accounts are consideration for the investment advice given by Good Profit to its clients. Thus, prima facie Good Profit is an investment adviser as defined under regulation 2 (m) of IA Regulations.  9.3 The activity of Good Profit by virtue of its website contents amounts to holding itself to be giving trading tips, stock specific recommendations, etc., to the investors and general public. The fact of the receipt of money in the bank statements, prima facie, shows, on preponderance of probability basis, that the credit for payment of fees is in__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Good Profit Advisory Company and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani Page 10 of 18 fact meant for the advisory services actually rendered by Good Profit. Therefore, Good Profit has not only held itself out as an investment adviser but also is acting as an investment adviser for consideration.  Issue No.2: If answer to the aforesaid issue is in affirmative, whether Good Profit has, prima facie, violated any provisions of SEBI Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act) read with IA Regulations?  10. In order to ensure that the investors who receive investment advice are protected, it is imperative that any person carrying out investment advisory activities has to necessarily obtain registration from SEBI and conduct its activities in accordance with the provisions of SEBI Regulations. Section 12(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) reads as under:  \\\\\\\\u201cNo stock broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue, trustee of trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and such other intermediary who may be associated with securities market shall buy, sell or deal in securities except under, and in accordance with, the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act:\\\\\\\\u201d  Further, as per Regulation 3(1) of the SEBI  (Investment  Advisers)  Regulations,  2013 (hereinafter referred to as the IA Regulations), the registration of the investment advisers is mandatory. It provides that, \\\\\\\\u201cOn and from the commencement of these regulations, no person shall act as an investment adviser or hold itself out as an investment adviser unless he has obtained a certificate of registration from the Board under these regulations\\\\\\\\u201d.  11. The activities of Good Profit, as brought out from the various materials described above, seen in the backdrop of the aforesaid provisions show that Good Profit is holding itself out and acting as an investment adviser. However, no material is available on record to indicate__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Good Profit Advisory Company and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani Page 11 of 18 that Good Profit or its proprietor Ms. Jansirani are holding a certificate of registration as an investment adviser. As per her own admission, neither the firm nor Ms. Jansirani have a certificate of registration as an investment advisor. It is also noted that the application for registration filed by Ms. Jansirani was rejected by SEBI as Ms. Jansirani was not qualified and certified as per the specifications mentioned in Regulation 7 of the IA Regulations. In this context, it is noted that neither Good Profit nor Jansirani in their individual capacity are registered with SEBI or in any capacity. The characteristics and features of the business activity carried out by Good Profit, as discussed in the preceding issue, prima facie, coupled with its own admission that they are not registered as an investment adviser leads to the  conclusion  that Good Profit is holding itself  out  and  acting  as  an  investment  adviser  without  a  certificate  of registration.  12. In my view, these activities/ representations without holding the certificate of registration as investment adviser is prima facie, in violation of Section 12(1) of SEBI Act read with Regulation 3(1) of the IA Regulations.  Issue No. 3: If answers to Issue Nos. (1) & (2) are affirmative, who is responsible for the violations? 13. I note that Ms. Jansirani is the sole proprietor of Good Profit. I note the legal status of the proprietary firm from the judgment of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme court in Ashok Transport Agency v. Awadhesh Kumar & another, [(1998) 5 SCC 567] that \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026A proprietary concern is only the business name in which the proprietor of the business carries on the business. A suit by or against a proprietary concern is by or against the proprietor of the business\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d. Therefore, I find that Ms. Jansirani is liable for the acts of Good Profit.  Issue No. 4: If answer to Issue No.  (2) is affirmative, whether urgent directions, if any should be issued against those responsible for the violations?  14. SEBI has a statutory duty to protect the interests of investors in securities and promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market.  Section 11 of the SEBI Act has__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Good Profit Advisory Company and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani Page 12 of 18 empowered it to take such measures as it thinks fit for fulfilling its legislative mandate. The IA Regulations have been formulated with the main objective of regulating Investment Advisory Services to safeguard the interests of investors and hence registration of such activities with SEBI has been made mandatory. The IA Regulations, inter alia, seek to create a structure within which investment advisers will operate and also make them duly accountable for their investment advice by requiring investment advisers to comply with the criteria set out in the relevant provisions of the IA Regulations. The same is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of the securities market.  15. In the instant case, Good Profit is soliciting and inducing investors to deal in securities market on the basis of investment advice, stock tips etc., prima facie, without having the requisite registration/certification as mandated under the IA Regulations. Further, it is noted from material available on record of that, the website gpsa.in is active as on date and money has been credited to the Bank accounts of Good Profit even as recent as December 2020. The account is active and can continue to be used to collect fees from unsuspecting investors.    16. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent  Good Profit through its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani from  collecting any more  fees from  the  public  and indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. I note that the website gpsa.in is active as on date and the investors can also reach Good Profit through telephone, Messenger also. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Good Profit in the securities market is still in existence and imminent. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Good Profit is Rs. 29.99 Lacs and the same indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors.   17. It is noted that permitting the investors to receive an investment advisory service from an unregistered entity, in effect means, the same is received from the unqualified person__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Good Profit Advisory Company and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani Page 13 of 18 without following the safeguards mentioned in the IA Regulations. An investor receiving a service from registered investment advisor in consonance with the IA Regulations visa-vis an investor who receives such service from unregistered investment adviser stands at a disadvantageous position in respect of his protection as an investor as envisaged under the IA regulations. An unregistered investment adviser has not satisfied the Regulator that he is a fit and proper person to hold the certificate of registration as investment adviser. Availing of service from such persons is detrimental to investors and such unqualified services results in irreparable detriment as the investors\\\\\\\\u2019 money is invested based on unqualified and un-regulated service. Exposing investors to such service also has the effect of interfering with the development of securities market, as victim of such services tend to lose faith in the securities market. Such an injury/detriment to the development of the securities market also qualifies as an \\\\\\\\u201cirreparable injury\\\\\\\\u201d. The objective of SEBI as enshrined in the SEBI Act is not only the protection of investors but also orderly development of securities market.   18. Further if an ex-parte order is not passed, many prospective investors may have to part away with large fees and investments resulting into irreparable injury to themselves as discussed earlier. However, if an ex-parte order is passed, what is at stake is right of the current entity herein vis-a-vis multitude of prospective and current clients of the entity. It may be noted that one of the underlying differences between the ex-parte orders in the case of private suits and ex-parte public enforcement actions, is the identification of the injured party. In private damage suits, the injured individual, as \\\\\\\\u201cwhole\\\\\\\\u201d, is identifiable whereas ex-parte public enforcement actions, seeks to protect the floating multitude of investing public by preventing, continuous and imminent violations of the securities laws. Though, it can be argued that a final remedy by way of refund is available, as against the step of passing an ex-parte interim order, the potential loss of investment by the investors by following the advice from an unqualified person and resultant loss of investor\\\\\\\\u2019s confidence and reliability of securities market, cannot be retrieved, if, prima facie, unregistered investment advice is permitted to be extended to the investors by not passing an ex-parte__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Good Profit Advisory Company and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani Page 14 of 18 interim order at this stage. Therefore, I consider the balance of convenience is also not in favour of the entity.     19. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present matter and on the basis of the prima facie findings, it is necessary to take urgent preventive action in this matter and to take immediate steps to prevent Good Profit from collecting any more fees from the public and from indulging in unauthorized investment advisory activities. As noted in the preceding paragraphs, as recent as December 2020, amounts are credited in the bank accounts of Good Profit and bank accounts are still active. Moreover, the website of Good Profit gpsa.in is still active. The aforesaid prima facie demonstrates that Good Profit can still lure investors to deal in the securities market while acting on its advice and probability of investors reaching it is still high. Therefore, the threat of investors getting lured towards the unregistered activity of Good Profit in the securities market is still in existence and imminent.  20. The amount of money, prima facie, observed to have been collected by Good Profit is Rs. 29.99 Lacs and indicates the magnitude of the prospective threat to the investors. In light of the same, I find that there is no other alternative but to take recourse through an interim ex-parte order against Good Profit and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani for preventing it from collecting funds by indulging in unauthorized investment advisory services without obtaining the mandatory registrations from SEBI in accordance with the law. As the website gpsa.in and bank accounts of Good Profit and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani are active and the investors can reach them through telephone/Messenger also, the balance of convenience demands the preventive measure of stopping the collection of money in the bank accounts of the Good Profit and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani from investors. The same can be effectively achieved by an appropriate direction of stopping the credit into the bank account of Good Profit and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani. As Good Profit and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, the balance of convenience also demands that Good Profit and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani have to be prevented from diverting the funds collected__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in respect of Good Profit Advisory Company and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani Page 15 of 18 from the investors through the unauthorized investment advisory activity. Accordingly, an appropriate direction stopping the debit from the bank account of Good Profit and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani have been incorporated.  21. With the initiation of quasi-judicial proceedings, and given the fact that Good Profit and its Proprietor Ms. Jansirani have already evaded the jurisdiction of SEBI by prima facie, acting as unregistered investment adviser, it is imminent that the Noticee may divert the money collected from the subscribers/clients. The same may result in defeating the effective implementation of the direction of refund, if any, to be passed after deciding the matter on merits. It therefore becomes necessary for SEBI to take urgent steps to prevent Noticee from diverting the money collected from the subscribers / clients. It is also essential to take urgent steps to prevent them from alienating any assets, whether movable or immovable, or any interest or investment or charge in any of such assets, so that the final remedies, if any, do not become infructuous. In view of the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove, and considering the interests of already existing clients of these Noticee and also the interests of those who may fall prey", "Date": "2020-12-29", "Regulatory": "SEBI", "Title": "Interim Order in the matter of Good Profit Advisory Company", "URL": "https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/dec-2020/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-good-profit-advisory-company_48610.html", "bu": "compliance_week", "regulator_region": "India", "source": "kastu_data", "sr_no": 58321, "unique_record_id": "e00409c53fSEBI20201229", "relatedNews": null, "parsed_article_id": "6680b18b785891030647185e", "parse_date": "2024-06-30 01:14:17", "prompt_ver": 4, "gpt_type": "Penalty Notice", "gpt_category": "Category: Fraud - Unregistered", "gpt_sub_category": null, "gpt_keywords": null, "gpt_activity": null, "gpt_financial": "29.99 Lacs", "gpt_audience": "1.

Page 1 of 13  WTM/AB/IVD/ID10/10008/2020-21  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA ORDER  Under Section 15I (3) read with Section 19 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, 1992 \\\\\\\\u2013 In respect of Adjudication order dated August 14, 2018 passed against A G Shares & Securities Ltd. (PAN: AAACA7646M) in the matter of M/s. Pipavav Defence & Offshore Engineering Company Ltd., M/s. Parsvanath Developers Ltd, M/s. Glodyne Technoserve Ltd. and M/s. Tulip Telecom Ltd.  1. Present proceedings have emanated from a show cause notice dated November 09, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) issued by Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) under Section 15-I(3) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) to M/s. A. G. Shares & Securities Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticee\\\\\\\\u201d) calling upon it to show cause as to why appropriate penalty should not be imposed against the Noticee in terms of Section 15HA and Section 15HB of SEBI Act, 1992 for the violation as alleged in the show cause notice dated February 25, 2016 issued by adjudicating officer which led to passing of Adjudication Order dated August 14, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u2018AO Order\\\\\\\\u2019).   2. Show Cause Notice dated February 25, 2016 by adjudicating officer came to be issued as SEBI had initiated adjudication proceedings under Section 15HA and 15HB of SEBI Act, 1992 against the Noticee, a stock broker and a member of NSE, for allegedly having executed the unauthorized trades in the account of Ramkripa Securities Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Ramkripa\\\\\\\\u2019) and thereby failing to adhere to Clauses A(1), A (2) and B(1) of the Code of Conduct as prescribed under the Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of SEBI (Stock Broker and Sub broker) Regulations, 1992 and also violating Regulation 4(1) and 4(2)(m) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003\\\\\\\\u2019). Thereafter, the AO Order under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 came to be passed wherein the adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee were disposed of by theOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of A G Shares & Securities Ltd. Page 2 of 13  adjudicating officer with the following observations:   \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..7. From the material available on record. I noted that Ramkripa was the client of the Noticee during the investigation period and during the price fall in Glodyne, Ramkripa sold shares of Glodyne, for which 11B proceedings were initiated against Ramkripa for the violation of regulations 3 and 4 of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. OD initiated the instant adjudication proceedings against the Noticee for the said unauthorized trades of Ramkripa in the scrip of Glodyne. Ramkripa had traded the impugned shares of Glodyne through the Noticee. I note from the WTM order dated January 18, 2013 that with regard to the alleged trading through Noticee, Ramkripa has submitted that it had been cheated by the broker i.e. the Noticee and the alleged shares were sold by the broker without its permission and it had complained to the respective stock exchanges for the illegal actions of brokers. However, WTM SEBI vide order dated January 18, 2013 had not acceded to the submission of Ramkripa on the ground that Ramkripa has not produced any evidence in support of its claim that those trades were carried out in its accounts by the Noticee without its instruction/permission. Further, I observe from the material available on record that no evidence had been submitted by IA that the Noticee carried out unauthorized trade for its client Ramkripa except the reply of Ramkripa to OD vide letter dated February 09, 2014. Also, I observe from the order dated June 26, 2014 passed by the WTM SEBI that Ramkripa had been given benefit of doubt as no adverse observation could be found in the investigation.  8.In view of the above, I am inclined of give benefit of doubt to the Noticee in light of the WTM, SEBI orders dated January 18, 2013 and June 25, 2014.\\\\\\\\u201d  Personal Hearing, Replies and Submissions:  3. I note that personal hearing for the Noticee was held on September 14, 2020. The Noticee has filed its merit based reply dated August 27, 2020 to the SCN. The Noticee has also filed its written submissions dated September 24, 2020. The following is a gist of the contentions raised by the Noticee in its reply and in its oral submissions made during the personal hearing:  a. We are members of NSE since past 20 years. We have never been found guilty by any authority of illegal trading activities of any scrip which may harm SEBI objectives, either directly or indirectly.Order under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of A G Shares & Securities Ltd. Page 3 of 13  b. The then director, Shri Sureshkumar Nandlal Sharma of Ramkripa, came across us and opened trading account for doing share trading in NSE in the name of Ramkripa.   c. All trading done in the account of Ramkripa was done on the instigation/ instructions of Sureshkumar Nandlal Sharma only.   d. Gradually, it came to our notice that Sureshkumar Nandlal Sharma\\\\\\\\u2019s intentions were bad since inception and he was a foul player of the share market, as is very much evident from the 21 orders passed by SEBI against two other companies {intermediaries registered with SEBI i.e. Sanchay Fincon Ltd. (active trading member of BSE) and Sanchay Finvest Ltd. (listed at BSE and active trading member at NSE)}.   e. Ramkripa has no locus standi as on date and it is a shell company. It did not file balance sheet with MCA after March 31, 2016 and has not filed balance sheet as on March 31, 2014 with MCA.   f. In view of the acquittal of the actual accused i.e. Ramkripa, we do not find any infirmity in the AO Order of not imposing monetary penalty on us.   g. Sureshkumar Nandlal Sharma traded in the name of his Company i.e. Ramkripa in the scrip of Glodyne, purely in capacity of client with us.   h. Margin funding was also done to him with intention to earn interest and brokerage. As on date of mid-cap crash i.e. July 26, 2012, Ramkripa had a big amount of debit balance with us. Once the scrip started hitting lower circuit, shares were sold as per our Risk Management Policy. However, even after having sold some shares, there was still debit balance of Rs. 4.48 Crores {2.59 Crores (AGSSL) + 1.89 Crores (Seema)} in Ramkripa\\\\\\\\u2019s account in our books. Every attempt was made to approach Sureshkumar Nandlal Sharma but to no avail. Ultimately the case ended up in arbitration, in BSE giving award in our favor while in NSE giving award in Ramkripa\\\\\\\\u2019s favor. Till date the arbitration award in BSE is not honoured by Ramkripa.Order under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of A G Shares & Securities Ltd. Page 4 of 13   i. For the alleged trades of July 2012, first show cause notice was issued on February 25, 2016 i.e. after more than 42 months of trades. Second SCN was issued on November 9, 2018 i.e. after more than 75 months of trades and holding hearing on September 14, 2020 i.e. after further more than 22 months. There is an inordinate delay in these proceedings which is unsustainable.   Consideration of submissions and findings thereon:   4. Before dealing with the contentions of the Noticee, it would be appropriate to refer to the brief background of the matter which is important for determination of the issue involved in the present matter. The background facts of the case are as under:  (i) On the basis of market surveillance observation in the downward movement in the price of four scrips namely M/s. Pipavav Defence & Offshore Engineering Company Ltd., M/s. Parsvanath Developers Ltd, M/s. Glodyne Technoserve Ltd. and M/s. Tulip Telecom Ltd., on July 26, 2012, SEBI had passed an ex-parte ad-interim order dated August 3, 2012 against 19 entities including Ramkripa, restraining them from accessing the securities market and further prohibiting them from buying, selling and dealing in securities in any manner till further directions.   (ii) In response to the allegations made against it in the ex-parte ad interim order dated August 03, 2012, during the proceedings before the WTM-SEBI, Ramkripa had inter- alia submitted that it had been cheated by the Noticee, as the shares were sold by the Noticee in the scrip of Glodyne Technoserve Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Glodyne\\\\\\\\u2019) without its permission and it had complained to the stock exchanges for the illegal actions of the Noticee. However, as Ramkripa had not produced any evidence in support of its claim and hence, WTM-SEBI did not find any reason to differ from the prima facie findings in the ex-parte ad interim order and confirmed the directions issued vide the ex-parte ad interim order against Ramkripa, vide the confirmatory order dated January 18, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cConfirmatoryOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of A G Shares & Securities Ltd. Page 5 of 13  Order\\\\\\\\u2019).   (iii) Upon completion of investigation in the matter and as the investigation could not establish anything adverse against 8 out of the 19 entities, benefit of doubt was accorded to the 8 entities concerned including Ramkripa. Accordingly, no further action was called for against the said 8 entities and the directions issued against those 8 entities including Ramkripa, vide the aforesaid ex-parte ad-interim order and confirmed vide different confirmatory orders including the Confirmatory Order, were revoked vide the final order dated June 26, 2014 passed by SEBI.   (iv) It is pertinent to note here that though no adverse findings were observed by the investigation against the suspected entities for price manipulation, but the investigation on the basis of replies of the Noticee and Ramkripa, examination of client KYC documents of Ramkripa and the NSE arbitration panel award, had concluded that the Noticee had conducted unauthorized trades from the account of Ramkripa in the scrip of Glodyne on July 26, 2012, for which SEBI had initiated adjudication proceedings against the Noticee for failing to follow Clauses A(1), A (2) and B(1) of the Code of Conduct as prescribed under the Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of SEBI (Stock Broker and Sub broker) Regulations, 1992 and violating Regulation 4(1) and 4(2)(m) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003.   5. I note that a proceedings under Section 15-I(3) of SEBI Act, 1992 can be undertaken if an order passed by the adjudicating officer is erroneous to the extent that it is not in the interests of securities market.   6. The relevant extract of the Confirmatory Order which has been relied upon in the AO Order is reproduced as under:  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201c4. I  have  considered  the  written  and  oral  submissions  of  the  noticee (Ramkripa)  and  the  relevant material available on record. The limited issue to be considered in this order is to decide whether,  based  on  the  available  material  on  record  and  after  considering  the submissions made by the noticee, the directions issued by vide ad interim ex-parte order need to be continued, revoked or modified in anyOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of A G Shares & Securities Ltd. Page 6 of 13  manner, in so far as it relates to the noticee. 5. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.. 6. With regard to the alleged trading through A.G. and Seema, the noticee has submitted that it had been cheated by them and the alleged 8292 and 12981 shares respectively were sold by the brokers without its permission and it had complained to the respective stock exchanges for the illegal actions of A.G. and Seema. However, the noticee has not produce any evidence in support of its claim that those trades were carried out in its accounts by A.G. and Seema without its instruction/permission. I, therefore, do not find any reason to differ from the prima facie findings in the interim order with regard to this trade of the noticee\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  7. The ex-parte ad interim order was passed against 19 entities including Ramkripa who was the client of the Noticee. As can be noted from the perusal of the observations of WTM-SEBI in the Confirmatory Order, the limited purpose for consideration before the WTM-SEBI in those proceeding was whether Ramkripa has made out a case for revocation of interim directions which were issued against Ramkripa vide the ex parte ad interim order, without hearing the noticees therein. Therefore, the limited scope of the proceedings before WTM-SEBI in passing Confirmatory Order was to confirm or revoke the directions issued vide ex parte interim order against the Noticee, after hearing the explanation furnished by Ramkripa. It is only when Ramkripa claimed during the post decisional hearing before WTM-SEB about the unauthorized trades in his accounts by the Noticee, that WTM-SEBI, made the observations that no corroborating proof was provided by Ramkripa in support of its claim. I note that the observations made by WTM-SEBI in the Confirmatory Order were merely a remark in respect of inadequacy of evidence to differ from the prima facie findings recorded in the ex-parte ad interim order and the said observations were in no way a determination about the dispute in respect of the unauthorized trades. I note that the proceedings against the alleged manipulators including Ramkripa, were the enforcement proceedings initiated by SEBI for the alleged violations of the provisions of the securities laws. The Noticee herein was not even a party to the said enforcement proceedings. Therefore, dispute between the Noticee and Rampkripa with respect to unauthorized trades was never and can never be question for determination in such enforcement proceedings against the violators of securities laws. Therefore, I find that, the reliance placed by the Adjudicating Officer upon the observations in the Confirmatory Order in respectOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of A G Shares & Securities Ltd. Page 7 of 13  of the unauthorized trades, was thus misplaced. Hence, I find that the AO Order was erroneous to that extent. I also note that, both the orders i.e. the ex-parte ad-interim order dated August 3, 2012 and the Confirmatory Order, were passed by SEBI against the alleged manipulators on the basis of the preliminary inquiry by SEBI, pending further investigation in the matter. Thus, the AO Order was erroneous in relying on the observations of the Confirmatory Order which itself were transitory in nature.    8. Another error pointed out against the AO Order by the SCN, is that it records that it is observed from the material available on record that no evidence had been submitted by the investigating authority that the Noticee and Seema Securities Ltd. carried out unauthorized trades for their client Ramkripa except the reply of Ramkripa vide its letter dated February 09, 2014. I note that apart from the reply of Ramkripa, the investigating authority has also relied on the client KYC documents of Ramkripa and the award passed by the Arbitration Panel at NSE on December 18, 2013 in arbitration Ref. no. CMM-0041/2013. I note that investigation found that as per the KYC documents of Ramkripa one Shri Suresh Sharma was appointed as authorised signatory to deal with all financial and non-financial transactions of Ramkripa with the Noticee. Investigation on the basis of arbitration award passed by arbitration panel of NSE in favour of Ramkripa further found that the Noticee executed the trades in the account of Ramkripa on the basis of instructions received from one Shri Dharmesh Purohit, who was not the authorized representative of Ramkripa. I note that, vide the arbitration award dated December 18, 2013, the arbitration panel at NSE found the impugned trades that were executed from the account of Ramkripa on July 26, 2012 in the scrip of Glodyne, to be unauthorized trades and accordingly, the claims made by Ramkripa against the Noticee for those unauthorized trades were admitted by the arbitration panel. In case of claims or counter claims between the two private parties, the arbitrator gives a finding on the claims after considering the evidence produce before him. There is no bar on investigating authority to take cognizance of facts as recorded in an award. In the present case, investigating authority has taken cognizance of facts as recorded in the arbitral award of panel of arbitrators of NSE. I note that investigation report was part of the record of the adjudication proceedings and the same was also an annexure to the show cause notice dated February 25, 2016 issued by theOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of A G Shares & Securities Ltd. Page 8 of 13  adjudicating officer. Therefore, the AO Order is erroneous when it records that no evidence had been submitted by the investigating authority that the Noticee carried out unauthorized trades for their client Ramkripa except the reply of Ramkripa vide its letter dated February 09, 2014.    9. From the facts and circumstances of the present case, I note that the substratum of the present matter was a dispute between a stock broker and its client with respect to alleged \\\\\\\\u2018unauthorized trades\\\\\\\\u2019. Such claims/counter claims are disputed question of facts between two private parties which cannot be adjudicated by SEBI as proceedings before SEBI are in the nature of enforcement proceedings pursuant to issue of a show cause notice alleging violations of securities laws by the defaulting entities. For determining such private disputes and adjudging the claims and counter claims arising out of such disputes, an elaborate framework for alternate dispute mechanism has been provided by SEBI under the aegis of the respective stock exchanges under their bye-laws framed under Section 9(2)(n) of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. In this regard, reference may also be made to the observations made by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT which are reproduced hereunder:  a. Ibrahim  Ahmed  vs.  SEBI  (Appeal  No.  40 of 2009) decided on June 30, 2009\\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.This dispute  between  the  parties  cannot  be  gone  into  by  the  Board which is a statutory regulator meant to protect the interest of the investors and to regulate the securities market\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026...\\\\\\\\u201d b.

As  regards  the  dues which the appellant is claiming, it would be open to it to resort to proceedings before an appropriate forum for recovering the same. The Board cannot take upon itself to adjudicate such contractual issues\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d c.

The Board cannot adjudicate such disputes. It can only regulate the market\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201dOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of A G Shares & Securities Ltd. Page 9 of 13   Further, National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission while dealing with a case of unauthorized use of DP account, in its order dated October 28, 2020 passed in the matter of Waman Nagesh Upaskar Vs. India Infoline Ltd. found that the DP account holder whose demat account was unauthorisedly misused, was entitled for compensation, as a consumer, from India Infoline, DP, under Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  10. The adjudication proceedings that were initiated in the present matter against the Noticee by issue of a show cause notice, were in the nature of proceedings for violation of provisions of securities laws, against a stock broker acting as an intermediary in the securities market. In light of the foregoing, I note that the errors committed in the AO Order in respect of misplaced reliance on the findings in the Confirmatory Order and incorrect appreciation of evidence on record, as discussed in the pre-paras, are prejudicial to the interests of the securities market and hence warrants the invocation of powers under section 15-I (3) of the SEBI Act, 1992 against the AO Order.   11. I note that for the impugned trades in the scrip of Glodyne, Ramkripa had also initiated Arbitration proceedings against the Noticee under the dispute resolution mechanism at NSE. The panel of arbitrators passed an award dated December 18, 2013 vide which the claims made by Ramkripa against the Noticee for the alleged unauthorized trades were accepted and the Noticee was directed to transfer 21,000 shares of Glodyne to Ramkripa and pay a sum of Rs. 2,92,486.15 alongwith interest @ 12% p.a. to Ramkripa. The Noticee preferred an appeal before the Appellatte Arbitration panel at NSE against the said arbitration award. The Appellatte Arbitration Tribunal vide an order dated August 22, 2014, dismissed the appeal filed by the Noticee and the award of the lower bench was confirmed by the Appellate Arbitration Tribunal. I note that the Noticee, then preferred an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Bombay High Court in Arbitration Petition No. 2/ 2015, thereby impugning the award passed by the Appellate Arbitration Tribunal. Vide its reasoned judgement dated January 28, 2019, the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Bombay High Court dismissed the Arbitration Petition No. 2/ 2015 filed by the Noticee, by finding it inappropriate to interfere with the AppellateOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of A G Shares & Securities Ltd. Page 10 of 13  Arbitration award, and thereby not providing any relief to the Noticee. Therefore, the issue whether the Noticee had executed unauthorized trades in the account of Ramkripa stands determined by awards passed by the Arbitration panel and Appellate Arbitration panel of NSE and interference with these awards has been declined by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Bombay High Court. Hence, the contention of the Noticee that the impugned trades were executed by it in order to recover dues from its client i.e. Ramkripa who was having debit balance, is not tenable. I also note that for the impugned trades, Ramkripa had also referred the dispute with Seema Securities Ltd. (member of BSE and sister concern of the Noticee) to the arbitration panel at BSE. The award passed by the arbitration panel constituted by BSE, was ruled in favour of Seema Securities Ltd. However, in a Section 34 petition before the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Bombay High Court, the award passed by the arbitration panel at BSE was set aside, by the judgment and order dated January 28, 2019.   12. I note that by entering into the impugned unauthorized trades, the Noticee has violated the provisions of Clauses A (1) and A (2) of the Code of Conduct as prescribed under the Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of SEBI (Stock Broker and Sub broker) Regulations, 1992 and Regulation 4(1) and 4(2)(m) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003, which reads as under:  Securities and Exchange Board of India (Stock Brokers Regulations, 1992   Conditions of registration.  9.Any registration granted by the Board under regulation 6 shall be subject to the following conditions, namely,  \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026 (f) he shall at all times abide by the Code of Conduct as specified in Schedule II   SCHEDULE II  Securities and Exchange Board of India (Stock Brokers Regulations, 1992  CODE OF CONDUCT FOR STOCK BROKERS  [Regulation 9]  A.

Page 12 of 13   14. Before imposition of monetary penalty, adjudicating officer has to take into account the factors enumerated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992. Since the present proceedings are the extension of adjudication proceedings, therefore, it is incumbent upon me to take into account the factors enumerated under Section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992 which provides as under:   \\\\\\\\u201cFactors to be taken into account while adjudging quantum of penalty. 15J.    While adjudging quantum of penalty under 15-I or section 11 or section 11B, the Board or the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely: \\\\\\\\u2014    (a)  the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default;    (b)  the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default;    (c)  the repetitive nature of the default.   Explanation. \\\\\\\\u2014For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E, clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.\\\\\\\\u201d  15. I note that material available on record does not indicate the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, made as a result of the default. Regarding amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default, I note that the claims of Ramkripa, in whose account the Noticee has been found to have executed unauthorized trades, have already been admitted by the Arbitration panel and the Appellate Arbitration panel of NSE. Further, the material available on record does not indicate that the default by the Noticee was repetitive in nature.  16. In view of the above, I, in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 15-I(3) read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992 impose penalty on the Noticee as follows:  a) Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two lacs only) under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992; and b) Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lac only) under Section 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992.Order under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of A G Shares & Securities Ltd.

(PAN: AACCS7683Q) in the matter of M/s. Pipavav Defence & Offshore Engineering Company Ltd., M/s. Parsvanath Developers Ltd, M/s. Glodyne Technoserve Ltd. and M/s. Tulip Telecom Ltd.  1. Present proceedings have emanated from a show cause notice dated November 09, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) issued by Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) under Section 15-I(3) of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act, 1992\\\\\\\\u201d) to M/s. Seema Securities Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u201cthe Noticee\\\\\\\\u201d) calling upon it to show cause as to why appropriate penalty should not be imposed against the Noticee in terms of Section 15HA and Section 15HB of SEBI Act, 1992 for the violation as alleged in the show cause notice dated February 26, 2016 issued by adjudicating officer which led to passing of Adjudication Order dated August 14, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u2018AO Order\\\\\\\\u2019).   2. Show Cause Notice dated February 26, 2016 by adjudicating officer came to be issued as SEBI had initiated adjudication proceedings under Section 15HA and 15HB of SEBI Act, 1992 against the Noticee, a stock broker and a member of BSE, for allegedly having executed the unauthorized trades in the account of Ramkripa Securities Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Ramkripa\\\\\\\\u2019) and thereby failing to adhere to Clauses A(1), A (2) and B(1) of the Code of Conduct as prescribed under the Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of SEBI (Stock Broker and Sub broker) Regulations, 1992 and also violating Regulation 4(1) and 4(2)(m) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003\\\\\\\\u2019). Thereafter, the AO Order under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 came to be passed wherein the adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee were disposed of by theOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of Seema Securities Ltd. Page 2 of 10  adjudicating officer with the following observations:   \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..7. From the material available on record. I noted that Ramkripa was the client of the Noticee during the investigation period and during the price fall in Glodyne, Ramkripa sold shares of Glodyne, for which 11B proceedings were initiated against Ramkripa for the violation of regulations 3 and 4 of PFUTP Regulations, 2003. OD initiated the instant adjudication proceedings against the Noticee for the said unauthorized trades of Ramkripa in the scrip of Glodyne. Ramkripa had traded the impugned shares of Glodyne through the Noticee. I note from the WTM order dated January 18, 2013 that with regard to the alleged trading through Noticee, Ramkripa has submitted that it had been cheated by the broker i.e. the Noticee and the alleged shares were sold by the broker without its permission and it had complained to the respective stock exchanges for the illegal actions of brokers. However, WTM SEBI vide order dated January 18, 2013 had not acceded to the submission of Ramkripa on the ground that Ramkripa has not produced any evidence in support of its claim that those trades were carried out in its accounts by the Noticee without its instruction/permission. Further, I observe from the material available on record that no evidence had been submitted by IA that the Noticee carried out unauthorized trade for its client Ramkripa except the reply of Ramkripa to OD vide letter dated February 09, 2014. Also, I observe from the order dated June 26, 2014 passed by the WTM SEBI that Ramkripa had been given benefit of doubt as no adverse observation could be found in the investigation.  8.In view of the above, I am inclined of give benefit of doubt to the Noticee in light of the WTM, SEBI orders dated January 18, 2013 and June 25, 2014.\\\\\\\\u201d  Personal Hearing, Replies and Submissions:  3. I note that personal hearing for the Noticee was held on September 14, 2020. The Noticee has filed its merit based reply dated August 27, 2020 to the SCN. The Noticee has also filed its written submissions dated September 24, 2020. The following is a gist of the contentions raised by the Noticee in its reply and in its submissions made during the personal hearing:  a. We are members of BSE since past 20 years. We have never been found guilty by any authority of illegal trading activities of any scrip which may harm SEBI objectives, either directly or indirectly.Order under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of Seema Securities Ltd. Page 3 of 10  b. The then director, Shri Sureshkumar Nandlal Sharma of Ramkripa, came across us and opened trading account for doing share trading in BSE in the name of Ramkripa.   c. All trading done in the account of Ramkripa was done on the instigation/ instructions of Sureshkumar Nandlal Sharma only.   d. Gradually, it came to our notice that Sureshkumar Nandlal Sharma\\\\\\\\u2019s intentions were bad since inception and he was a foul player of the share market, as is very much evident from the 21 orders passed by SEBI against two other companies {intermediaries registered with SEBI i.e. Sanchay Fincon Ltd. (active trading member of BSE) and Sanchay Finvest Ltd. (listed at BSE and active trading member at NSE)}.   e. Ramkripa has no locus standi as on date and it is a shell company. It did not file balance sheet with MCA after March 31, 2016 and has not filed balance sheet as on March 31, 2014 with MCA.   f. In view of the acquittal of the actual accused i.e. Ramkripa, we do not find any infirmity in the AO Order of not imposing monetary penalty on us.   g. Sureshkumar Nandlal Sharma traded in the name of his Company i.e. Ramkripa in the scrip of Glodyne, purely in capacity of client with us.   h. Margin funding was also done to him with intention to earn interest and brokerage. As on date of mid-cap crash i.e. July 26, 2012, Ramkripa had a big amount of debit balance with us. Once the scrip started hitting lower circuit, shares were sold as per our Risk Management Policy. However, even after having sold some shares, there was still debit balance of Rs. 4.48 Crores {2.59 Crores (AGSSL) + 1.89 Crores (Seema)} in Ramkripa\\\\\\\\u2019s account in our books. Every attempt was made to approach Sureshkumar Nandlal Sharma but to no avail. Ultimately the case ended up in arbitration, in BSE giving award in our favor while in NSE giving award in Ramkripa\\\\\\\\u2019s favor. Till date the arbitration award in BSE is not honoured by Ramkripa.Order under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of Seema Securities Ltd. Page 4 of 10   i. For the alleged trades of July 2012, first show cause notice was issued on February 25, 2016 i.e. after more than 42 months of trades. Second SCN was issued on November 9, 2018 i.e. after more than 75 months of trades and holding hearing on September 14, 2020 i.e. after further more than 22 months. There is an inordinate delay in these proceedings which is unsustainable.   Consideration of submissions and findings thereon:   4. Before dealing with the contentions of the Noticee, it would be appropriate to refer to the brief background of the matter which is important for determination of the issue involved in the present matter. The background facts of the case are as under:  (i) On the basis of market surveillance observation in the downward movement in the price of four scrips namely M/s. Pipavav Defence & Offshore Engineering Company Ltd., M/s. Parsvanath Developers Ltd, M/s. Glodyne Technoserve Ltd. and M/s. Tulip Telecom Ltd., on July 26, 2012, SEBI had passed an ex-parte ad-interim order dated August 3, 2012 against 19 entities including Ramkripa, restraining them from accessing the securities market and further prohibiting them from buying, selling and dealing in securities in any manner till further directions.   (ii) In response to the allegations made against it in the ex-parte ad interim order dated August 03, 2012, during the proceedings before the WTM-SEBI, Ramkripa had inter- alia submitted that it had been cheated by the Noticee, as the shares were sold by the Noticee in the scrip of Glodyne Technoserve Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \\\\\\\\u2018Glodyne\\\\\\\\u2019) without its permission and it had complained to the stock exchanges for the illegal actions of the Noticee. However, as Ramkripa had not produced any evidence in support of its claim and hence, WTM-SEBI did not find any reason to differ from the prima facie findings in the ex-parte ad interim order and confirmed the directions issued vide the ex-parte ad interim order against Ramkripa, vide the confirmatory order dated January 18, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\\\\\\u201cConfirmatoryOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of Seema Securities Ltd. Page 5 of 10  Order\\\\\\\\u2019).   (iii) Upon completion of investigation in the matter and as the investigation could not establish anything adverse against 8 out of the 19 entities, benefit of doubt was accorded to the 8 entities concerned including Ramkripa. Accordingly, no further action was called for against the said 8 entities and the directions issued against those 8 entities including Ramkripa, vide the aforesaid ex-parte ad-interim order and confirmed vide different confirmatory orders including the Confirmatory Order, were revoked vide the final order dated June 26, 2014 passed by SEBI.   (iv) It is pertinent to note here that though no adverse findings were observed by the investigation against the suspected entities for price manipulation, but the investigation on the basis of replies of the Noticee and Ramkripa, examination of client KYC documents of Ramkripa and the NSE arbitration panel award, had concluded that the Noticee had conducted unauthorized trades from the account of Ramkripa in the scrip of Glodyne on July 26, 2012, for which SEBI had initiated adjudication proceedings against the Noticee for failing to follow Clauses A(1), A (2) and B(1) of the Code of Conduct as prescribed under the Schedule II read with Regulation 9 of SEBI (Stock Broker and Sub broker) Regulations, 1992 and violating Regulation 4(1) and 4(2)(m) of SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, 2003.   5. I note that a proceedings under Section 15-I(3) of SEBI Act, 1992 can be undertaken if an order passed by the adjudicating officer is erroneous to the extent that it is not in the interests of securities market.   6. The relevant extract of the Confirmatory Order which has been relied upon in the AO Order which is reproduced as under:  \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201c4. I  have  considered  the  written  and  oral  submissions  of  the  noticee (Ramkripa)  and  the  relevant material available on record. The limited issue to be considered in this order is to decide whether,  based  on  the  available  material  on  record  and  after  considering  the submissions made by the noticee, the directions issued by vide ad interim ex-parte order need to be continued, revoked or modified in anyOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of Seema Securities Ltd. Page 6 of 10  manner, in so far as it relates to the noticee. 5. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.. 6. With regard to the alleged trading through A.G. and Seema, the noticee has submitted that it had been cheated by them and the alleged 8292 and 12981 shares respectively were sold by the brokers without its permission and it had complained to the respective stock exchanges for the illegal actions of A.G. and Seema. However, the noticee has not produce any evidence in support of its claim that those trades were carried out in its accounts by A.G. and Seema without its instruction/permission. I, therefore, do not find any reason to differ from the prima facie findings in the interim order with regard to this trade of the noticee\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d  7. The ex-parte ad interim order was passed against 19 entities including Ramkripa who was the client of the Noticee. As can be noted from the perusal of the observations of WTM-SEBI in the Confirmatory Order, the limited purpose for consideration before the WTM-SEBI in those proceeding was whether Ramkripa has made out a case for revocation of interim directions which were issued against Ramkripa vide the ex parte ad interim order, without hearing the noticees therein. Therefore, the limited scope of the proceedings before WTM-SEBI in passing Confirmatory Order was to confirm or revoke the directions issued vide ex parte interim order against the Noticee, after hearing the explanation furnished by Ramkripa. It is only when Ramkripa claimed during the post decisional hearing before WTM-SEBI about the unauthorized trades in his accounts by the Noticee, that WTM-SEBI, made the observations that no corroborating proof was provided by Ramkripa in support of its claim. I note that the observations made by WTM-SEBI in the Confirmatory Order were merely a remark in respect of inadequacy of evidence to differ from the prima facie findings recorded in the ex-parte ad interim order and the said observations were in no way a determination about the dispute in respect of the unauthorized trades. I note that the proceedings against the alleged manipulators including Ramkripa, were the enforcement proceedings initiated by SEBI for the alleged violations of the provisions of the securities laws. The Noticee herein was not even a party to the said enforcement proceedings. Therefore, dispute between the Noticee and Rampkripa with respect to unauthorized trades was never and can never be question for determination in such enforcement proceedings against the violators of securities laws. Therefore, I find that, the reliance placed by the Adjudicating Officer upon the observations in the Confirmatory Order in respectOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of Seema Securities Ltd. Page 7 of 10  of the unauthorized trades, was thus misplaced. Hence, I find that the AO Order was erroneous to that extent. I also note that, both the orders i.e. the ex-parte ad-interim order dated August 3, 2012 and the Confirmatory Order, were passed by SEBI against the alleged manipulators on the basis of the preliminary inquiry by SEBI, pending further investigation in the matter. Thus, the AO Order was erroneous in relying on the observations of the Confirmatory Order which itself were transitory in nature.  8. Another error pointed out against the AO Order by the SCN, is that it records that it is observed from the material available on record that no evidence had been submitted by the investigating authority that the Noticee and A G Shares and  Securities Ltd. carried out unauthorized trades for their client Ramkripa except the reply of Ramkripa vide its letter dated February 09, 2014. I note that apart from the reply of Ramkripa, the investigating authority has also relied on the client KYC documents of Ramkripa and the award passed by the Arbitration Panel at NSE on December 18, 2013 in arbitration Ref. no. CMM-0041/2013. I note that though the NSE Arbitration panel award dated December 18, 2013 is not relevant for the purpose of action against the Noticee, who is a member of BSE, however, the AO Order was erroneous to hold that no evidence has been provided by the Investigating Authority. I note that investigation found that as per the KYC documents of Ramkripa one Shri Suresh Sharma was appointed as authorised signatory to deal with all financial and non-financial transactions of Ramkripa with the Noticee. I note that investigation report was part of the record of the adjudication proceedings and the same was also an annexure to the show cause notice dated February 26, 2016 issued by the adjudicating officer. Therefore, the AO Order is erroneous when it records that no evidence had been submitted by the investigating authority that the Noticee carried out unauthorized trades for their client Ramkripa except the reply of Ramkripa vide its letter dated February 09, 2014.    9. From the facts and circumstances of the present case, I note that the substratum of the present matter was a dispute between a stock broker and its client with respect to alleged \\\\\\\\u2018unauthorized trades\\\\\\\\u2019. Such claims/counter claims are disputed question of facts between two private parties which cannot be adjudicated by SEBI as proceedings before SEBI are in the nature of enforcement proceedings pursuant toOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of Seema Securities Ltd. Page 8 of 10  issue of a show cause notice alleging violations of securities laws by the defaulting entities. For determining such private disputes and adjudging the claims and counter claims arising out of such disputes, an elaborate framework for alternate dispute mechanism has been provided by SEBI under the aegis of the respect stock exchanges. In this regard, reference may also be made to the observations made by Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble SAT which are reproduced hereunder:  a. Ibrahim  Ahmed  vs.  SEBI  (Appeal  No.  40 of 2009) decided on June 30, 2009\\\\\\\\u2013 \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.This dispute  between  the  parties  cannot  be  gone  into  by  the  Board which is a statutory regulator meant to protect the interest of the investors and to regulate the securities market\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026...\\\\\\\\u201d b. MCS Ltd vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 107 of 2008) decided on September 26, 2008- \\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..The Board rightly directed the appellant to return all the data/records and the same has  been  complied  with  by  the  appellant.  As  regards  the  dues which the appellant is claiming, it would be open to it to resort to proceedings before an appropriate forum for recovering the same. The Board cannot take upon itself to adjudicate such contractual issues\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u201d c. Hameed Ullah Lalji alias Tony Ullah vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 123 of 2008) decided on January 12, 2009 -\\\\\\\\u201c\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026These disputes are obviously of a civil nature and can appropriately  be  decided  by  a Civil  Court.  The Board cannot adjudicate such disputes. It can only regulate the market\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026.\\\\\\\\u201d  10. The adjudication proceedings that were initiated in the present matter against the Noticee by the issue of show cause notice, were in the nature of proceedings for violation of provisions of securities laws, against a stock broker acting as an intermediary in the securities market. In light of the foregoing, I note that the errors committed in the AO Order in respect of misplaced reliance on the findings in the Confirmatory Order and incorrect appreciation of evidence on record, as discussed in the pre-paras, are prejudicial to the interests of the securities market and hence warrants the invocation of powers under section 15-I (3) of the SEBI Act, 1992 against the AO Order.Order under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of Seema Securities Ltd. Page 9 of 10  11. I note that for the impugned trades in the scrip of Glodyne, Ramkripa had also initiated arbitration proceedings against the Noticee under the dispute resolution mechanism at BSE for unauthorized trades executed by the Noticee in its account on the platform of BSE. The panel of arbitrators passed an award dated December 6, 2013 vide which the claims made by Ramkripa against the Noticee for the alleged unauthorized trades executed on BSE, were rejected and the counterclaim made by the Noticee against Ramkripa was accepted. I note that Ramkripa had filed Arbitration Petition No. 1095 of 2014 before Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Bombay High Court, under Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, thereby impugning the award passed by the arbitration panel of BSE. The said Arbitration Petition filed by Ramkripa was tagged alongwith the Arbitration Petition No. 2 of 2015 filed by A G Shares and Securities Ltd. (sister concern of the Noticee) against an award passed by appellate arbitration tribunal of NSE in favour of Ramkripa, in respect of unauthorized trades executed on NSE, vide a common judgement and order dated January 28, 2019 passed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Bombay High Court. By the said judgment and order, Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble High Court allowed the Arbitration Petition No. 1095 of 2014 by setting aside the award dated December 6, 2013 passed by arbitration panel of BSE and upholding the award passed by the arbitration panel of NSE as upheld by the Appellate Arbitration Tribunal of NSE. As regards, the consequence of setting aside of an Arbitration award under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, the observations of the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Delhi High Court in the judgement dated July 2, 2014 passed in the matter of State Trading Corporation of India Ltd. v. M/s Toepfer International Asia  Pte. Ltd. 2014 (144) DRJ 220, are worth noting:  \\\\\\\\u201c7. Arbitration is intended to be a faster and less expensive alternative to the courts. If this is one\\\\\\\\u201f s motivation and expectation, then the finality of the arbitral award is very important. The remedy provided in Section 34 against an arbitral award is in no sense an appeal. The legislative intent in Section 34 was to make the result of the annulment procedure prescribed therein potentially different from that in an appeal. In appeal, the decision under review not only may be confirmed, but may also be modified. In annulment, on the other hand, the decision under review may either be invalidated in whole or in part or be left to stand if the plea for annulment is rejected. Annulment operates to negate a decision, in whole or in part, thereby depriving the portion negated of legal force and returning the parties, as to that portion, to their original litigating positions. Annulment can void, while appeal can modify\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026..\\\\\\\\u201dOrder under Section 15-I (3) of SEBI Act, 1992 in respect of Seema Securities Ltd. Page 10 of 10   12. I note that, the material available on record does not indicate that, after the judgement and order dated January 28, 2019 passed by the Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Bombay High Court, Ramkripa has pursued its claim against the Noticee for unauthorized trades executed on BSE before any court/ forum. Thus, the allegation against the Noticee that it had executed unauthorized trades in the account of Ramkripa on BSE, is not made out.   13. In view of the aforesaid, the SCN issued against Noticee is disposed of without imposition of penalty.  14. This is order comes into force with immediate effect.  15. Copy of the order shall be sent to the recognized stock exchanges, depositories and the Noticee for information and necessary action, if any.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (\\\\\\\\u201cSEBI\\\\\\\\u201d) received a letter dated September 19, 2019 from Vistara ITCL (India) Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u2018Vistara\\\\\\\\u2019), a SEBI registered Debenture Trustee in which Vistara had provided a list of companies from which it had not received till that date the Half Yearly Communication (\\\\\\\\u2018HYC\\\\\\\\u2019) as per Regulation 52(4) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, (\\\\\\\\u2018LODR Regulations\\\\\\\\u2019) for the half year ended March 31, 2019. The aforesaid list of companies included Embassy Property Development Pvt. Ltd. (\\\\\\\\u2018Noticee/Company\\\\\\\\u2019). In view of the aforesaid information, SEBI conducted an examination and had observed prima facie violation of Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations by the Noticee.   APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  2. The undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer (\\\\\\\\u2018AO\\\\\\\\u2019) vide order dated June 10, 2020, under Section 19 read with Section 15-I of Securities and Exchange Board of India, 1992 (hereinafter, \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI Act\\\\\\\\u201d) and under Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry Adjudication Order in respect of Embassy Property Development Pvt.

SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 3. A Show Cause Notice dated August 28, 2020 (hereinafter, \\\\\\\\u201cSCN\\\\\\\\u201d) was issued by the AO to the Noticee under Rule 4 of the Rules, calling it to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held against it and penalty be not imposed on it under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act for the violations as specified in the SCN and reproduced herein below: (a) Failure to submit financial results of the company for the half year ended March 31, 2019 to the exchange, which is not in compliance of Regulation 52(1) of the LODR Regulations. (b) Failure to disclose the line items as specified under the Regulation 52(4) of LODR Regulations to the exchange. (c) Failure to submit the certificate signed by the Debenture Trustee taking note of the contents prescribed under Regulation 52(4) of LODR Regulations to the exchange, thereby non-compliance with Regulation 52(5) of LODR Regulations. 4. In response to this, the Noticee vide its email dated September 09, 2020 requested for some more time to file their reply to the SCN. Hence, vide email dated September 11, 2020, the Noticee was asked to submit its reply to the SCN latest by September 21, 2020 and also an opportunity of personal hearing was provided to the Noticee on September 24, 2020.  5. The Noticee submitted its reply to the SCN vide its email dated September 18, 2020, which is summarized as below: \\\\\\\\u201cEmbassy Office Parks REIT (REIT) was India\\\\\\\\u2019s first REIT. The Noticee (\\\\\\\\u2018EPDPL\\\\\\\\u2019) is a sponsor to the REIT with 14.9% stake and holds equity investment in the manager to the REIT. As it was India\\\\\\\\u2019s first REIT, EPDPL had various accounting aspects to be addressed before closing the books of accounts Adjudication Order in respect of Embassy Property Development Pvt. Ltd.                                                         Page 3 of 10        and need to carry out various technical evaluations with regards to the method of accounting of the investment of Embassy Office Parks REIT in its books. EPDPL had to take decisions on the relationship between Embassy Office Parks REIT and itself, to established whether the investment should be carried at cost or carried at fair value;   The accounting treatment would have substantial impact on the statement of profit and loss of EPDPL and hence required a long deliberation on the accounting treatment. Hence there was delay in submissions of results to the stock exchange as well as delay in submission of limited review financials to National Stock Exchange of India Limited (Exchange);   Due to aforesaid circumstances we were constrained to finalise the books of accounts only during September 2019 and were able to file the Audited Statement of accounts on September 12, 2019 and Certificate under Regulation 52(5) on November 11, 2019 to the Exchange.\\\\\\\\u201d  6. Subsequently, hearing in the matter was conducted on September 24, 2020. The said hearing was attended by the Authorized Representatives (\\\\\\\\u2018AR\\\\\\\\u2019) of the Noticee in which they reiterated their submissions made vide its earlier replies.   7. Taking into account the aforesaid facts, I am of the view that principle of natural justice has been followed in the matter by granting the Noticee ample opportunities for replying to the SCN and of being heard. Therefore, I deem it appropriate to decide the matter on the basis of facts/material available on record and replies submitted by the Noticee.   ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS 8. I have taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case and the material available on record and the issues that arise for consideration in the present case are: Adjudication Order in respect of Embassy Property Development Pvt. Ltd.                                                         Page 4 of 10        a. Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of the LODR Regulations?  b. Does the violation, if any, on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under Section 15 A(b) of the SEBI Act? c. If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15 J of the SEBI Act?   9. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of LODR Regulations, which reads as under:  Regulation 52(1) \\\\\\\\u201cThe listed entity shall prepare and submit un-audited or audited financial results on a half yearly basis in the format as specified by the Board within forty-five days from the end of the half year to the recognised stock exchange(s). Provided that in case of entities which have listed their equity shares and debt securities, a copy of  the  financial  results  submitted  to  stock  exchanges  shall  be  provided  to  Debenture Trustees on the same day the information is submitted to stock exchanges.\\\\\\\\u201d  Regulation 52(4) \\\\\\\\u201cThe listed entity, while submitting half yearly / annual financial results, shall disclose the following line items along with the financial results: (a) credit rating and change in credit rating (if any); (b) asset cover available, in case of non-convertible debt securities; (c) debt-equity ratio; (d) previous due date for the payment of interest / dividend for non-convertible redeemable preference shares / repayment of principal of non-convertible preference shares / non-convertible debt securities and whether the same has been paid or not; and, Adjudication Order in respect of Embassy Property Development Pvt. Ltd.                                                         Page 5 of 10        (e) next due date for the payment of interest/ dividend of non-convertible preference shares /principal along with the amount of interest / dividend of non-convertible preference shares payable and the redemption amount;  (f) debt service coverage ratio;  (g) interest service coverage ratio; (h) outstanding redeemable preference shares (quantity and value); (i) capital redemption reserve/debenture redemption reserve; (j) net worth; (k) net profit after tax; (l) earnings per share: Provided that the requirement of disclosures of debt service coverage ratio, asset cover and interest service coverage ratio shall not be applicable for banks or non-banking financial companies registered with the Reserve Bank of India. Provided further that the requirement of this sub-regulation shall not be applicable in case of unsecured debt instruments issued by regulated financial sector entities eligible for meeting capital requirements as specified by respective regulators.\\\\\\\\u201d  Regulation 52(5) \\\\\\\\u201cThe listed entity shall within seven working days from the date of submission of the information required under sub-regulation (4), submit to stock exchange(s), a certificate signed by debenture trustee that it has taken note of the contents\\\\\\\\u201d Prior to May 07, 2019, the aforesaid sub-regulation 5 of Regulation 52 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 read as \\\\\\\\u201cWhile submitting the information required under sub-regulation (4), the listed entity shall submit to stock exchange(s), a certificate signed by debenture trustee that it has taken note of the contents\\\\\\\\u201d. Adjudication Order in respect of Embassy Property Development Pvt. Ltd.                                                         Page 6 of 10        FINDINGS 10. The first issue for consideration is whether the Noticee has violated Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of the LODR Regulations. 11. It may be noted that Regulation 52(1) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations provides for submission of the financial results within forty-five days from the end of the half year. Further, Regulation 52(4) provides for disclosure of certain line items along with the half yearly / annual financial results, while Regulation 52(5) provides for submission of a Certificate signed by the Debenture Trustee taking note of the contents prescribed under Regulation 52(4). 12. From the fact of the case, I observe that in pursuance of the reference of Vistra, SEBI sought information from Exchanges (NSE and BSE) regarding the compliance status of the Noticee with respect to Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations for the half year ended March 31, 2019. From the submissions of the NSE vide its email dated October 11, 2019, it was observed that the company has not complied with provisions of Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations. 13. The Noticee in its reply has submitted that the Noticee was a sponsor to the REIT (\\\\\\\\u201cEmbassy Office Parks REIT\\\\\\\\u201d) with 14.9% stakes. The Noticee further submitted that as it was India\\\\\\\\u2019s first REIT, the Noticee had various accounting aspects to be addressed before closing the books of accounts and there was a need to carry out various technical evaluations with regards to the method of accounting of the investment of the REIT in its books. Hence, the Noticee finally submitted that because of these reasons, there was a delay in submissions of results to the stock exchange.    14. In this regard, I note that the procedural difficulties faced by the company in closing their books of accounts and carrying out technical evaluations with regards to the method of accounting etc. is their internal matter which does not absolve the Noticee from filing the said disclosures under LODR Regulations. In this regard, I further note that a listed entity is required to comply with the relevant Regulations/directions issued by SEBI from time to time. In the instant matter, the provision of said Regulation does not give any relaxation Adjudication Order in respect of Embassy Property Development Pvt. Ltd.                                                         Page 7 of 10        from complying with the same for any procedural challenges like this.  Therefore, I do not accept this contention of the Noticee. 15. I further note that it is crucial to mention here that financial statements are important because they contain significant information about a company's financial health. They are the barometer of a company's operations. Investors depend on the truth and fairness in the financial statements to make informed decisions. Moreover, it is not only investors, but a lot of stakeholders like operational creditors and lending institutions like banks that need to gauge the profitability and track record before opening up lines of credit to a company.   16. Further, timely disclosure of relevant information by listed companies is essential for maintaining transparency about the affairs of the Company which helps in eliminating information asymmetry. Moreover, correct and timely disclosures play an essential role in the proper functioning of the securities market and failure to do so results in depriving the investors from taking well informed investment decision. In this context, I would like to rely on observation of Hon'ble SAT in the matter of Coimbatore Flavors & Fragrances Ltd. vs SEBI (Appeal No. 209 of 2014 order dated August 11, 2014) wherein it was held that \\\\\\\\u201cUndoubtedly, the purpose of these disclosures is to bring about more transparency in the affairs of the companies. True and timely disclosures by a company or its promoters are very essential from two angles. Firstly; investors can take a more informed decision to invest or not to invest in a particular scrip secondly; the Regulator can properly monitor the transactions in the capital market to effectively regulate the same.\" 17. Further, from the submissions of the Noticee, I observe that the Noticee has admitted that it had failed to make the aforesaid disclosures on time and hence the Noitcee had not denied the fact that it has violated the provisions of Regulation 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations. 18. Based on the aforesaid findings, I conclude that the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulations 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of LODR Regulations. 19.  I further note that Hon\\\\\\\\u2019ble Supreme Court of India, in the matter of Chairman, SEBI vs. Shriram Mutual Fund {[2006] 5 SCC 361} held that \"In our view, the penalty is attracted as soon as contravention of the statutory obligations as contemplated by the Act is established and, therefore, the Adjudication Order in respect of Embassy Property Development Pvt. Ltd.                                                         Page 8 of 10        intention of the parties committing such violation becomes immaterial. \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026. Hence, we are of the view that once the contravention is established, then the penalty has to follow and only the quantum of penalty is discretionary\\\\\\\\u201d.  20. In view of the foregoing, I am convinced that the Noticee is thus liable for monetary penalty under Section 15A(b) of SEBI Act for violation of Regulations 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of the LODR Regulations. The provisions of Section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read as under: SEBI Act 15A - \\\\\\\\u201cPenalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. \\\\\\\\u2013  If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or Regulations made there under-  (a) \\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026\\\\\\\\u2026  (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the Regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the Regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less\\\\\\\\u201d. 21. While determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, it is important to consider the factors relevantly as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under:- Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer. Section 15J - While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:- (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default. Adjudication Order in respect of Embassy Property Development Pvt. Ltd.                                                         Page 9 of 10        Explanation. \\\\\\\\u2014For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E, clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section. 22. The material available on record has not quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, if any, made by the Noticee and the loss, if any, suffered by the investors as a result of the Noticee\\\\\\\\u2019s failure. I also note that no prior default of the Noticee is available on record. However, the facts of the case clearly bring out the default made by the Noticee. I note that the Noticee had failed to make timely disclosures thereby has violated Regulations 52(1), 52(4) and 52(5) of the LODR Regulations.  ORDER 23. In view of the above, after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and the factors mentioned in the provisions of Section 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 5 of Rules, I hereby impose a penalty of Rs 3,00,000/- (Rupees Three lacs only) on the Noticee viz.  Embassy Property Development Pvt. Ltd. in terms of the provisions of Section 15A(b) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. In the facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the view that the said penalty is commensurate with the default committed by the Noticee.  24. The Noticees shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either by way of Demand Draft in favour of \\\\\\\\u201cSEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India\\\\\\\\u201d, payable at Mumbai, OR through online payment facility available on the website of SEBI, i.e. www.sebi.gov.in on the following path, by clicking on the payment link: ENFORCEMENT \\\\\\\\uf0e0 Orders \\\\\\\\uf0e0 Orders of AO \\\\\\\\uf0e0 PAY NOW.
